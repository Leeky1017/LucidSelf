### Core Thesis in One Sentence
> Effective birthchart interpretation requires systematic control over information flow: start with the Primal Triad (Sun=ego, Moon=soul, Ascendant=mask), consider hemisphere emphasis, identify focalizing planets, and use the six guidelines to maintain perspective—synthesizing the whole into "identity, the soul behind that identity, and the mask it wears in the world."

## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text**:
> The fundamental difficulty in astrological interpretation is that the birthchart generates too much information.
> GUIDELINE NUMBER ONE: Ignore everything until you have thoroughly grasped the sun, moon, and ascendant.
> Sun, moon, and ascendant stand head and shoulders above the other influences. They are the Primal Triad. [...] Think of the primal triad as forming the skeleton of the character.
> Sun establishes identity [...] Moon represents the subjective elements [...] The Ascendant is the wrapping placed over the interactions of the sun and moon [...] we both hide behind the ascendant and express ourselves through it.
> The archetypes can be mixed and matched in any way you please. [...] We could say that he is the artist, with the soul of the genius, wearing the mask of the warrior.

## L2 - Critical Analysis Layer

### L2.1 Logical Evaluation of Arguments

| Dimension | Assessment | Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Are premises reasonable? | `Reasonable` | Sun/Moon/Ascendant primacy is widely accepted; information management is a real challenge |
| Is reasoning valid? | `Reasonable` | The guidelines provide clear prioritization logic |
| Is conclusion reliable? | `Reasonable` | The Primal Triad formula reliably captures character essence |

### L2.2 Comparison with Other Texts

| Text | Related View | Relationship | Analysis |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `christian_astro` (Lilly) | Different synthesis priorities (almuten, chart ruler) | `Complementary` | Forrest psychological; Lilly technical |
| Various modern texts | Similar emphasis on Sun/Moon/Ascendant | `Consistent` | Standard in modern practice |

### L2.3 Limitations and Applicability Boundaries

## L3 - Semantic Essence Layer

### L3.1 Core Concept Deconstruction

| Concept | Literal Meaning | Deep Semantics | Modern Reconstruction |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `Primal Triad` | Sun + Moon + Ascendant | The three most important chart factors that establish the skeleton of character | Primal_Triad = {Sun: ego, Moon: soul, Ascendant: mask} |
| `information overload` | Too much data | The birthchart contains more valid information than can be easily integrated; systematic control is necessary | Need for information_management |
| `archetype formula` | Sign archetypes for Sun/Moon/Asc | Quick synthesis: "[Sun archetype], with the soul of [Moon archetype], wearing the mask of [Asc archetype]" | Formula = "{Sun.archetype} with soul of {Moon.archetype} wearing mask of {Asc.archetype}" |
| `hemisphere emphasis` | Concentration in one quadrant | Overall life orientation: objective/subjective (horizon) and freedom/fate (meridian) | Hemisphere = life_context_modifier |
| `focalizers` | Strongly dignified planets | Planets that stand out and dominate the personality beyond the Primal Triad | Focalizer = high_emphasis_planet |

### L3.2 Abstract Rule Extraction

**Rule ID**: `rule_inner_sky_synthesis_method`

**Rule Structure** (pseudo-code form):

```
FUNCTION synthesize_birthchart(chart):
  # Guideline 1: Start with Primal Triad
  sun_analysis = interpret_bit(Sun, Sun.sign, Sun.house)
  moon_analysis = interpret_bit(Moon, Moon.sign, Moon.house)
  asc_analysis = interpret_ascendant(Ascendant.sign)
  primal_triad = synthesize(sun_analysis, moon_analysis, asc_analysis)
  
  # Apply archetype formula
  formula = "{Sun.sign.archetype}, with soul of {Moon.sign.archetype}, wearing mask of {Asc.sign.archetype}"
  
  # Guideline 2: Check hemisphere emphasis
  hemisphere = determine_hemisphere_emphasis(chart.planet_positions)
  
  # Guideline 3: Identify focalizers
  focalizers = identify_dignified_planets(chart)
  
  # Guidelines 4-6: Integrate aspects, rulerships, fine details
  # Only after establishing foundation
  
  RETURN complete_interpretation(primal_triad, formula, hemisphere, focalizers, aspects, ...)
  
WITH confidence = High
BECAUSE "Sun, moon, and ascendant stand head and shoulders above the other influences"
```

**Rule Operationalization**:

| Dimension | Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| Trigger operationalization | For any birthchart, begin with Primal Triad before anything else |
| Conclusion operationalization | Build interpretation in layers: foundation (Primal Triad) → context (hemisphere) → refinement (focalizers, aspects, etc.) |
| Confidence rationale | High; this is Forrest's master synthesis method |

### L3.3 Factor Extraction (Semantic Level)

| Factor Label | Factor ID | Semantic Essence | Extraction Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `Primal Triad` | `factor_inner_sky_primal_triad` | Sun/Moon/Ascendant as foundational three | "They are the Primal Triad" |
| `Sun as Ego` | `factor_inner_sky_sun_ego` | Sun establishes identity and ego structure | "Sun establishes identity [...] the self [...] ego" |
| `Moon as Soul` | `factor_inner_sky_moon_soul` | Moon represents emotional/subjective nature | "we can call the moon the soul" |
| `Ascendant as Mask` | `factor_inner_sky_asc_mask` | Ascendant is the social personality/vehicle | "helpful to think of the ascendant as the mask" |
| `Archetype Formula` | `factor_inner_sky_archetype_formula` | Quick synthesis using sign archetypes | "[archetype], with the soul of [archetype], wearing the mask of [archetype]" |

**Factor Status**: `new_candidate` (all five)
