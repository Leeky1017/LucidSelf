### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text**:
> The twelfth house closes the cycle of human experience. It is the last stage in a process which may be repeated during the lifetime of an individual, or terminated by what we call death. In the twelfth house the individual either consolidates his successes into the seed of a new cycle of growth, or he meets the accumulated results of his failures...
> His memories of the past, conscious or unconscious, crowd over the threshold in front of the new cycle. They are Angels of Light beckoning to the beyond, or they are dark Guardians of the Threshold, whose features are shaped by his frustrations, his denials of life, his fears, his sins of omission as well as commission.

### L3.2 Abstract Rule Extraction

**Rule ID**: `rule_twelfth_house_confrontation`

**Rule Structure** (pseudo-code form):

```
IF cycle_phase = twelfth_house
AND karma_accumulated = true
THEN confrontation_with_past = inevitable
WITH confidence = High
BECAUSE "The individual must face this compound entity which he himself has created. He must go through it, whatever the cost" (line 981)
UNLESS individual_has_completely_resolved_karma (rare)
```

**Rule Operationalization**:

| Dimension | Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| Trigger operationalization | Assess whether client is in completion phase facing accumulated consequences |
| Conclusion operationalization | Frame twelfth house experiences as necessary confrontation rather than arbitrary suffering |
| Confidence rationale | High - Rudhyar makes confrontation with accumulated past explicit |

**Rule ID**: `rule_twelfth_house_seed_formation`

**Rule Structure**:

```
IF cycle_successes = genuine
AND consolidation = occurs
THEN seed_for_new_cycle = formed
WITH confidence = High
BECAUSE "The individual either consolidates his successes into the seed of a new cycle of growth" (line 978)
UNLESS successes_were_illusory
```
