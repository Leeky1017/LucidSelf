## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text**:
> Why should there be experiences of sixth house readjustment and what does such a readjustment imply? This question can be answered by considering the fact that the sixth house follows the fifth house of self-expression and emotional or creative activity. A time comes in every man's life when he is forced to realize that what he does, feels, or thinks does not come up to the ideal of behavior, personal achievement, and success which he has set for himself...
> The basic significance is that of personal growth. Growth means transformation or change of condition... In the sixth house the individual may meet his shadow...
> The message of the sixth house is: Be ye transformed!
