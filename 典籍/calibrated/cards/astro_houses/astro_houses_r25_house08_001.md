AND trust_present = false
THEN activity = dangerous
WITH confidence = High
BECAUSE "To participate in a ritual activity when one does not trust the participants can be very dangerous" (line 805)
UNLESS activity_is_purely_formal_with_no_real_stakes
```

UNLESS partners_explicitly_disclaim_responsibility
```
