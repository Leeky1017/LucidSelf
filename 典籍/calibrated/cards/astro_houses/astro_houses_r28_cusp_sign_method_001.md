## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text**:
> The zodiacal sign on the Ascendant normally tells us much concerning the dharma of the individual — that is, the central potentiality which the person should seek consciously to actualize as a vessel or lens through which the Divine may act. (line 451)
>
> One can often discover what zodiacal sign was rising at birth by studying a person's features, particularly the structure of his face and his facial expression. (line 449)
>
> The cusps of the tenth house — the Mid-heaven — is one of the four angles of the birth chart... It represents the consummation of organic and communal functions. (line 897)
>
> The sign on the cusp of a house and the character of the planets which may be found in this house should give the student of astrology clues as to the best way in which he or she can solve these problems. (line 619)

**Context Analysis**:

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Preceding context | Rudhyar establishes houses as experiential fields; signs then qualify HOW those fields are experienced |
| Following direction | Cusp signs lead to consideration of planets in houses for further specification |
| Overall positioning | Methodological principle applying across all house interpretations |

### L1.2 Historical Background and Academic Lineage

| Dimension | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Writing context | Rudhyar integrates traditional cusp-sign interpretation with person-centered approach |
| Academic lineage | Traditional astrology's cusp-ruler system; Rudhyar adds dharmic/developmental dimension |
| Later developments | Influenced modern emphasis on cusp signs as showing approach rather than content |

### L1.3 Author's Intent and Rhetorical Analysis

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Author's intent | To establish systematic method for using cusp signs in house interpretation |
| Rhetorical strategy | Examples across multiple houses showing consistent application of principle |
| Implicit assumptions | Signs provide qualitative coloring; houses provide experiential field; synthesis yields interpretation |

## L3 - Semantic Essence Layer

### L3.1 Core Concept Deconstruction

| Concept | Literal Meaning | Deep Semantics | Modern Reconstruction |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `cusp` | Beginning point of house | The threshold where a new field of experience begins | The quality of approach to a life area |
| `sign on cusp` | Zodiacal sign at house beginning | The qualitative coloring of how that field is experienced | The mode or style of engaging with that life area |
| `ruler of sign` | Planet traditionally associated with sign | Additional guidance for understanding cusp quality | Planet whose condition further specifies cusp interpretation |
| `dharma indicator` | Purpose-revealing factor | Cusp sign (especially Ascendant) reveals life direction | The "how" of fulfilling house potential |

### L3.2 Abstract Rule Extraction

**Rule ID**: `rule_cusp_sign_interpretation`

**Rule Structure** (pseudo-code form):

```
IF house = <house_number>
AND cusp_sign = <zodiacal_sign>
THEN approach_to_house_matters = <sign_qualities>
WITH confidence = High
BECAUSE "The sign on the cusp of a house... should give the student of astrology clues as to the best way in which he or she can solve these problems" (line 619)
UNLESS planets_in_house_override_cusp_sign_influence
```

**Rule Operationalization**:

| Dimension | Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| Trigger operationalization | For any house question, first identify cusp sign, then apply sign qualities to house matters |
| Conclusion operationalization | Describe approach to house matters using cusp sign characteristics |
| Confidence rationale | High - Rudhyar consistently applies this principle across houses |

**Rule ID**: `rule_cusp_ruler_consideration`

**Rule Structure**:

```
IF cusp_sign = <sign>
AND ruler_of_sign = <planet>
AND ruler_condition = <aspects, house, sign>
THEN cusp_interpretation = modified_by_ruler_condition
WITH confidence = Medium
BECAUSE "the place and aspects to the ruler of that sign" (line 743) affect interpretation
UNLESS ruler_is_unaspected_or_weak
```

### L3.3 Factor Extraction (Semantic Level)

| Factor Label | Factor ID | Semantic Essence | Extraction Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `cusp_sign_quality` | `factor_cusp_quality` | The qualitative approach indicated by zodiacal sign on house cusp | Core interpretive principle |
| `ruler_condition` | `factor_ruler_condition` | State of the planet ruling the cusp sign | Modifies and specifies cusp interpretation |
| `angular_cusp_significance` | `factor_angular_cusp` | Special importance of four angle cusps (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) | Rudhyar emphasizes angles as most significant |

**Factor Status**: `existing` (cusp interpretation is standard astrological method)

## L4 - Cross-System Bridge Layer

### L4.1 Functional Equivalence Analysis

**Core Function**: Using zodiacal sign quality to specify how house matters are approached and experienced.

| Target System | Corresponding Concept | Functional Equivalence Argument | Academic Basis |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| BaZi (bazi) | 十神 (Ten Gods) in palaces | Both use a secondary factor to qualify primary field meaning | Both add qualitative layer to structural position |
| Psychology (psych) | Cognitive style applied to life domains | Cusp sign as cognitive/emotional style for approaching life area | Both address HOW matters are handled, not just WHAT matters exist |
| Tarot (tarot) | Suit + Position combination | Position (house) + quality (sign) similar to spread position + suit combination | Both combine structural position with qualitative factor |

### L4.3 Neutral Semantic Tag Mapping

| neutral_tag | Mapping Rationale | Applicability Limits |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `approach_style` | Cusp sign indicates style of approach | Applies across all houses |
| `qualitative_modifier` | Sign modifies basic house meaning | Works in combination with house and planet factors |

## L5 - Validation and Calibration Layer

### L5.1 Historical Case Validation

**Case Source**: Rudhyar's application examples

| Case Description | Conditions Met | Rule-Based Prediction | Actual Outcome | Validation Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Ascendant sign visible in physical appearance | Cusp sign manifests visibly | First house cusp sign should correlate with appearance | Traditional observation supports | `Validated` |

### L5.2 Modern Application Test Design

| Dimension | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Test scenario | Systematically test cusp sign predictions against life area approaches |
| Test method | Blind assessment of approach styles compared to predicted cusp sign qualities |
| Success criteria | Cusp sign predictions match reported approach styles at above-chance level |
| Failure criteria | No correlation between cusp sign and approach to house matters |

## L6 - Meta-Reflection Layer

### L6.1 Calibration Process Self-Review

| Dimension | Reflection |
|:---|:---|
| Main difficulties | Extracting consistent method from examples scattered across text |
| Subjective judgments | Synthesized method from multiple passages where Rudhyar applies the principle |
| Potential biases | May overemphasize cusp sign relative to planets in house |

### L6.2 Uncertainty Annotation

| Layer | Uncertainty | Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| L1 Comprehension | `Low` | Cusp sign method is traditional and Rudhyar applies it consistently |
| L3 Extraction | `Low` | Method is standard astrological practice |
| L4 Mapping | `Medium` | Cross-system parallels are functional analogies |
| L5 Validation | `Medium` | Empirical validation of cusp sign predictions is limited |

### L6.3 Questions for Further Research

1. How does interception (sign contained entirely within house) affect cusp interpretation?
2. What is the relative weight of cusp sign vs. planets in house?
3. How do cusp sign and house ruler interact when they are different signs?
