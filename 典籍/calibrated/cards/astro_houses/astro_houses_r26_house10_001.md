IF individual_capacity = matches_office_requirements
AND relationship_foundation = sound (seventh house)
AND understanding = adequate (ninth house)
THEN achievement = consummation
WITH confidence = High
BECAUSE "The combination of the right person with the office most meaningful to him constitutes the consummation of human existence" (line 879)
UNLESS external_circumstances_prevent
```
