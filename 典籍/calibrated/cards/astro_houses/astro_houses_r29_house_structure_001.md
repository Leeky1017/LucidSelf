### Core Thesis in One Sentence
> Houses are classified into three functional types—Angular (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) where power is initiated, Succeedent (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th) where power is used, and Cadent (3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th) where experiences are integrated or lead to crisis—creating a dynamic cycle of initiation, application, and synthesis.

## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text**:
> The second house is a "succeedent" house, and the motto of this type of house is to use. (line 470)
>
> The third house is called, quite significantly, a cadent house because it implies the possibility of a fall away from what is indicated in the angular house that has come before. A cadent house can mean integration and synthesis, or it may end in disintegration and collapse, or perversion. (line 539)
>
> In the second house an individual uses what he owns... But in the field of business, proper management takes on a superpersonal meaning... The eighth house deals with business proper because any type of business implies some kind of contract or agreement. (lines 802-810)
>
> In all such houses — second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh — the keynote is use. (line 809)

**Context Analysis**:

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Preceding context | Rudhyar establishes houses as experiential fields; structure shows dynamic relationships |
| Following direction | Understanding structure enables seeing how houses relate to each other |
| Overall positioning | Foundational structural principle for all house interpretation |

### L1.2 Historical Background and Academic Lineage

| Dimension | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Writing context | Rudhyar follows traditional angular/succeedent/cadent classification with developmental interpretation |
| Academic lineage | Ancient Greek/Hellenistic house classification; Rudhyar adds process-oriented meaning |
| Later developments | Influenced modern understanding of house dynamics as cyclical process |

### L1.3 Author's Intent and Rhetorical Analysis

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Author's intent | To establish houses as dynamic system rather than static categories |
| Rhetorical strategy | Consistent application of initiation-use-synthesis pattern across four quadrants |
| Implicit assumptions | Life follows cyclical patterns; power must be initiated, used, and integrated |

## L3 - Semantic Essence Layer

### L3.1 Core Concept Deconstruction

| Concept | Literal Meaning | Deep Semantics | Modern Reconstruction |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `Angular` | At the angles | Houses where fundamental power is initiated or established; the "what" | Crisis points of new beginning; self, home, relationship, career |
| `Succeedent` | Following | Houses where angular power is used and applied; the "how to use" | Application phase; resources, creativity, business, vision |
| `Cadent` | Falling | Houses where experiences are synthesized OR disintegrate; the "integration" | Either synthesis leading to next angular, or crisis and collapse |
| `quadrant` | Quarter of chart | Three-house sequence from angle to next angle | Complete mini-cycle within the larger twelve-house cycle |

### L3.2 Abstract Rule Extraction

**Rule ID**: `rule_house_type_function`

**Rule Structure** (pseudo-code form):

```
IF house_type = angular (1, 4, 7, 10)
THEN function = initiate_power
ELIF house_type = succeedent (2, 5, 8, 11)
THEN function = use_power
ELIF house_type = cadent (3, 6, 9, 12)
THEN function = integrate_or_disintegrate
WITH confidence = High
BECAUSE "The motto of this type of house [succeedent] is to use" (line 470) and "cadent house... implies the possibility of a fall" (line 539)
UNLESS individual_chart_factors_override
```

**Rule Operationalization**:

| Dimension | Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| Trigger operationalization | For any house question, first identify house type, then interpret according to function |
| Conclusion operationalization | Angular: what is being initiated; Succeedent: how it's being used; Cadent: is it integrating or falling apart |
| Confidence rationale | High - Rudhyar consistently applies this classification |

**Rule ID**: `rule_cadent_house_danger`

**Rule Structure**:

```
IF house_type = cadent
AND preceding_angular_and_succeedent = problematic
THEN cadent_experience = likely_negative
WITH confidence = High
BECAUSE "The process can backfire when the experiences related to the angular houses... have not been sound and wholesome, and/or the powers used in the succeedent houses... have been abused or misused" (line 539)
UNLESS individual_consciously_works_on_integration
```

### L3.3 Factor Extraction (Semantic Level)

| Factor Label | Factor ID | Semantic Essence | Extraction Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `house_type` | `factor_house_type` | Angular, Succeedent, or Cadent classification | Foundational structural classification |
| `power_phase` | `factor_power_phase` | Initiation, Use, or Integration stage | Dynamic interpretation of house type |
| `quadrant_position` | `factor_quadrant` | Which quarter of chart (1st through 4th) | Locates house within larger cycle |

**Factor Status**: `existing` (traditional astrological classification)

## L4 - Cross-System Bridge Layer

### L4.1 Functional Equivalence Analysis

**Core Function**: Organizing houses into functional groups showing dynamic power flow.

| Target System | Corresponding Concept | Functional Equivalence Argument | Academic Basis |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| BaZi (bazi) | 四柱 (Four Pillars) as sequence | Both organize factors into processual sequence | Both show development through stages |
| Psychology (psych) | Action-reflection cycles | Angular/Succeedent/Cadent parallels action-practice-integration cycles | Both describe learning/development cycles |
| I Ching (yijing) | 三才 (Three Powers) dynamics | Both use three-fold classification of cosmic process | Both see reality as three-phase cycle |

### L4.3 Neutral Semantic Tag Mapping

| neutral_tag | Mapping Rationale | Applicability Limits |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `process_phase` | House type indicates phase in power cycle | Applies to all houses |
| `structural_classification` | Angular/Succeedent/Cadent is structural | Universal across house systems |

## L5 - Validation and Calibration Layer

### L5.1 Historical Case Validation

**Case Source**: Rudhyar's consistent application

| Case Description | Conditions Met | Rule-Based Prediction | Actual Outcome | Validation Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Sixth house as cadent following fifth | Cadent type properly identified | Integration or crisis predicted | Rudhyar describes transformation and crisis | `Validated` |

### L5.2 Modern Application Test Design

| Dimension | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Test scenario | Test whether house type predicts experiential quality (initiation vs. use vs. integration) |
| Test method | Categorize life experiences by house, assess match with predicted type |
| Success criteria | Experiences in angular houses feel initiating; succeedent feel applicative; cadent feel synthesizing |
| Failure criteria | No correlation between house type and experiential quality |

## L6 - Meta-Reflection Layer

### L6.1 Calibration Process Self-Review

| Dimension | Reflection |
|:---|:---|
| Main difficulties | Synthesizing scattered references to house types into coherent system |
| Subjective judgments | Emphasized dynamic process interpretation based on Rudhyar's developmental approach |
| Potential biases | May underemphasize traditional strength/weakness meaning of house types |

### L6.2 Uncertainty Annotation

| Layer | Uncertainty | Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| L1 Comprehension | `Low` | House type classification is traditional and Rudhyar follows it |
| L3 Extraction | `Low` | Classification is explicit in astrological tradition |
| L4 Mapping | `Medium` | Cross-system parallels are structural analogies |
| L5 Validation | `Medium` | Experiential validation requires systematic study |

### L6.3 Questions for Further Research

1. How does house type interact with planet strength in that house?
2. Do cadent houses always carry danger, or only when preceding houses are problematic?
3. How does house type affect transit interpretation?
