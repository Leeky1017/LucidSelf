# Deep Calibration Card

## S - Synopsis

- `card_id`: `interp_dreams_ch7_function_001`
- `semantic_unit`: `Freud sketches the dream-process as a compromise: an unconscious wish attaches to day residues, encounters censorship, and regresses into perceptual dramatisation—allowing sleep to continue while making the dream noticeable to consciousness`
- `source_range`: `典籍/texts/The Interpretation of Dreams/原文/The Interpretation of Dreams.md:17392` ~ `:17435`
- `depth_level`: `Deep`
- `confidence`: `Medium`
- `last_updated`: `2026-01-28`

### Core Thesis in One Sentence
> The dream functions as a sleep-compatible route for unconscious wishes: blocked by censorship on the progressive path, the process regresses into perceptual dramatisation that can be noticed by consciousness without immediately waking the sleeper.

## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text** (selected lines within the semantic unit):
> (d) Waking caused by the Dream—The Function of the Dream—The Anxiety Dream.  
> … we have shown  
> that the waking activity leaves day remnants …  
> The unconscious  
> wish has already made its way to the day remnants …  
> This produces a wish  
> transferred to the recent material …  
> It is confronted, however, by  
> the censor … It now takes on the distortion …  
> But its further progress is now checked through  
> the dormant state of the foreconscious …  
> The dream process, therefore, takes the regressive  
> course … and thereby follows the attraction  
> exerted on it by the memory groups …  
> … when the dream process becomes a content of  
> perception it has, so to speak, eluded the obstacle …  
> It succeeds  
> in drawing attention to itself and in being noticed by consciousness.

**Context Analysis**:

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Preceding context | Builds on the Unc./Forec. model and the claim that the foreconscious “wish to sleep” suspends normal pathways at night. |
| Following direction | Continues into a more detailed account of consciousness, qualities, and how waking is triggered by dream stimulation. |
| Overall positioning | Provides a process-level explanation of dream function: why dreams form and how they can both preserve and interrupt sleep. |

## L3 - Semantic Essence Layer

### L3.1 Core Concept Deconstruction

| Concept | Literal Meaning | Deep Semantics | Modern Reconstruction |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `day remnants` | residues of day | Recent material that can be invested with energy and used as carriers | `recent_trace_carriers` |
| `censor` | censorship | Constraint that forces distortion and blocks direct access to consciousness | `constraint_gate` |
| `regression` | regressive course | Shift from abstract thought pathways to perceptual imagery (dramatisation) | `perceptual_recasting` |

### L3.2 Abstract Rule Extraction

**Rule ID**: `rule_interp_dreams_function_compromise`

**Rule Structure** (pseudo-code form):

```
IF <an unconscious wish gains energy during sleep>
AND <the progressive path is blocked by censorship + foreconscious dormancy>
THEN <the process regresses into perceptual dramatisation (dream content)>
WITH confidence = Medium
BECAUSE <Freud’s process sketch in Chapter VII (d)>
UNLESS <stimuli or affect exceed tolerance, triggering awakening>
```

### L3.3 Factor Extraction (Semantic Level)

| Factor Label | Factor ID | Semantic Essence | Extraction Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Day residue carrier | `day_residue_carrier` | Recent traces carry wish-energy | “day remnants… wish… made its way” |
| Censorship distortion | `censorship_distortion` | Censor forces distortion and blocks progress | “confronted… by the censor… distortion” |
| Regressive dramatisation | `regressive_dramatisation` | Shift into perceptual scene representation | “takes the regressive course… form of dramatisation” |

**Factor Status**: `new_candidate`

## L4 - Cross-System Bridge Layer

### L4.3 Neutral Semantic Tag Mapping

| neutral_tag | Mapping Rationale | Applicability Limits |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `Dream_Function` | Section explicitly frames “function of the dream” | Depends on accepting Freud’s system model |
| `Compromise_Process` | Dream emerges from blocked pathways + regression | Competing models exist (memory consolidation, threat simulation) |
| `Sleep_vs_Wake_Gating` | Dream both preserves sleep and can lead to noticing/awakening | Needs operational measures (arousal thresholds) |

## L6 - Meta-Reflection Layer

### L6.2 Uncertainty Annotation

| Layer | Uncertainty | Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| L3 Extraction | `Medium` | Terms (censor, regression) are theory-laden; operational equivalents may differ. |
| L4 Mapping | `High` | Cross-system mapping is best kept at neutral-tag level here. |
