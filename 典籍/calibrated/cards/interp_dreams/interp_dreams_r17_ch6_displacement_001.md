### Core Thesis in One Sentence
> Dream displacement shifts emphasis away from what is most important in the latent thoughts, producing a distorted manifest content that helps evade censorship.

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text** (selected lines within the semantic unit):
> (b) The Work of Displacement  
> … The dream, as it were, is eccentric; its contents  
> are grouped about other elements than the dream thoughts  
> as a central point. …  
>
> … In the  
> formation of dreams those elements which are emphasized  
> with intense interest may be treated as though they were inferior,  
> and other elements are put in their place …  
>
> … there has taken place in the formation of the  
> dream a transference and displacement of the psychic intensities  
> of the individual elements … The process which we assume here is nothing  
> less than the essential part of the dream activity; it merits  
> the designation of dream displacement. …  
> Dream displacement and dream condensation are the two craftsmen to whom we  
> may chiefly attribute the moulding of the dream. …  
> Dream displacement is one of the chief means for achieving this disfigurement.  
> … we have traced it back to the censorship …

**Context Analysis**:

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Preceding context | Follows condensation and the observation of over-determination; introduces a second major mechanism. |
| Following direction | Connects displacement to censorship and sets up further discussion of how mechanisms combine. |
| Overall positioning | Establishes displacement as a core mechanism explaining why manifest content diverges from latent “core” thoughts. |

### L1.2 Historical Background and Academic Lineage

| Dimension | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Writing context | Freud is systematizing dream-work mechanisms from psychoanalytic interpretation practice. |
| Academic lineage | Displacement parallels psychoanalytic techniques of tracing surface material to deeper suppressed concerns. |
| Later developments | Modern cognitive views may reframe displacement as salience reweighting, associative spreading activation, or narrative reconstruction. |

### L1.3 Author's Intent and Rhetorical Analysis

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Author's intent | Explain why dream content “misses” the latent core by shifting intensities and reorganizing salience. |
| Rhetorical strategy | Uses repeated illustrative contrasts (botanical monograph, June bugs, uncle dream) to show eccentricity. |
| Implicit assumptions | There is a censoring force that shapes dream formation by penalizing direct expression of certain thoughts. |

## L2 - Critical Analysis Layer

### L2.1 Logical Evaluation of Arguments

| Dimension | Assessment | Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Are premises reasonable? | `Partially` | Salience shifts between latent and manifest are plausible; attributing them to censorship is a stronger theoretical commitment. |
| Is reasoning valid? | `Partially` | The observation of “eccentric” manifest content supports a transformation; multiple mechanisms could explain it. |
| Is conclusion reliable? | `Partially` | Displacement is a useful explanatory construct; empirical isolation from other salience mechanisms requires constraints. |

### L2.3 Limitations and Applicability Boundaries

| Dimension | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Applicable conditions | Rich interpretive data where core concerns are inferable and manifest content clearly shifts emphasis. |
| Inapplicable conditions | Sparse recall; interpretation without constraint can “find” displacement anywhere. |

## L3 - Semantic Essence Layer

### L3.1 Core Concept Deconstruction

| Concept | Literal Meaning | Deep Semantics | Modern Reconstruction |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `displacement` | shifting/transfer | Salience/intensity is transferred from important to less important elements | `salience_reweighting` |
| `eccentric dream` | off-center | Manifest content clusters around non-core elements | `off_core_manifest` |
| `censorship` | censoring force | Constraint preventing direct expression of certain wishes | `expression_constraint` |

### L3.2 Abstract Rule Extraction

**Rule ID**: `rule_interp_dreams_displacement_salience`

**Rule Structure** (pseudo-code form):

```
IF <manifest dream emphasizes seemingly minor elements>
AND <latent analysis indicates a different “core” concern>
THEN <infer displacement (salience transfer) as a dream-work mechanism>
WITH confidence = Medium
BECAUSE <Freud: dream content is eccentric; intensities are displaced to achieve disfigurement>
UNLESS <alternative mechanisms (memory salience, narrative reconstruction) explain the shift better>
```

### L3.3 Factor Extraction (Semantic Level)

| Factor Label | Factor ID | Semantic Essence | Extraction Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Dream displacement | `dream_displacement_mechanism` | Salience transfer shaping manifest content | Explicitly defined as “essential part” of dream activity |
| Censorship pressure | `censorship_pressure` | Constraint driving disfigurement | Displacement linked to censorship in passage |
| Off-core manifest clustering | `manifest_eccentricity` | Manifest center differs from latent core | “dream… is eccentric” |

**Factor Status**: `new_candidate`

## L4 - Cross-System Bridge Layer

### L4.3 Neutral Semantic Tag Mapping

| neutral_tag | Mapping Rationale | Applicability Limits |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `Displacement` | Named mechanism for salience transfer | Needs constraints to avoid overfitting |
| `Censorship` | Proposed driver of distortion | Theoretical commitment; not universally accepted |
| `Salience_Shift` | Observable pattern (core vs surface mismatch) | May have non-psychoanalytic explanations |

## L5 - Validation and Calibration Layer

### L5.2 Modern Application Test Design

| Dimension | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Test scenario | Collect dreams + immediate waking concerns; evaluate whether manifest salience systematically avoids direct expression of reported concerns. |
| Test method | Pre-register “core concern” and code whether manifest content centers on peripheral substitutes; compare to matched control narratives. |
| Success criteria | Above-chance “core avoidance” pattern not explained by simple memory salience. |

### L6.2 Uncertainty Annotation

| Layer | Uncertainty | Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| L2 Critical | `Medium` | Multiple plausible mechanisms can produce salience shifts. |
| L5 Validation | `High` | Operationalizing “core concern” without circularity is difficult. |
