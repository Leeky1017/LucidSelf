# Deep Calibration Card

## S - Synopsis

- `card_id`: `interp_dreams_ch6_revision_001`
- `semantic_unit`: `Freud attributes dream “clearness” vs “confusion” to secondary elaboration (secondary dream-work), and summarizes dream-work as transformation constrained by censorship, displacement, condensation, and regard for presentability; “revision” is the only part akin to waking thought`
- `source_range`: `典籍/texts/The Interpretation of Dreams/原文/The Interpretation of Dreams.md:15388` ~ `:15481`
- `depth_level`: `Deep`
- `confidence`: `Medium`
- `last_updated`: `2026-01-28`

### Core Thesis in One Sentence
> Apparent coherence in dreams is a suspicious product of secondary elaboration, while the core dream-work is a distinct transformation process shaped by censorship and representational constraints, with only partial “revision” resembling waking thought.

## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text** (selected lines within the semantic unit):
> … Those parts of the dream with which  
> the secondary elaboration has been able to accomplish something  
> seem to us clear; those where the power of this activity  
> has failed seem confused. …  
> we may conclude that the secondary dream-work is also responsible  
> for a contribution to the plastic intensity of the  
> individual dream structures.  
>
> … the dream-work … limits itself to transforming. …  
> This product, the dream,  
> must at any cost be withdrawn from the censor … displacement …  
> Thoughts must … be  
> reproduced in the material of visual and acoustic traces of  
> memory, and this requirement secures for the dream-work  
> the regard for presentability … condensation …  
>
> Only one part of the dream-work—the revision varying in  
> amount, made by the partially roused conscious thought—at  
> all agrees with the conception which the authors have tried  
> to extend to the entire activity of dream formation.

**Context Analysis**:

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Preceding context | After analyzing representability and the “intelligibility demand,” Freud warns that surface coherence may be an imposed misunderstanding. |
| Following direction | Immediately transitions into Chapter VII (psychology of dream activities) to deepen the model of psychic systems. |
| Overall positioning | Provides a synthesis: secondary elaboration vs core dream-work, and a compact list of dream-work constraints. |

## L3 - Semantic Essence Layer

### L3.1 Core Concept Deconstruction

| Concept | Literal Meaning | Deep Semantics | Modern Reconstruction |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `secondary elaboration / revision` | later “cleanup” | Waking-like rationalization that imposes coherence on dream content | `post_hoc_rationalization_layer` |
| `regard for presentability` | make it depictable | Constraint: thoughts must be rendered in perceptual (image/sound) traces | `representational_constraint` |
| `censor` | censoring force | Constraint that shapes distortion and avoidance | `expression_constraint` |

### L3.2 Abstract Rule Extraction

**Rule ID**: `rule_interp_dreams_coherence_is_suspicious`

**Rule Structure** (pseudo-code form):

```
IF <a dream narrative seems especially coherent/clear>
THEN <treat that coherence as potentially produced by secondary elaboration>
AND <prioritize tracing elements back to latent material rather than trusting surface logic>
WITH confidence = Medium
BECAUSE <Freud: clearness vs confusion depends on secondary elaboration; coherence can be misunderstanding>
UNLESS <independent evidence shows coherence reflects stable latent structure>
```

### L3.3 Factor Extraction (Semantic Level)

| Factor Label | Factor ID | Semantic Essence | Extraction Justification |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Secondary elaboration | `secondary_elaboration` | Coherence-making overlay | “secondary elaboration… clear vs confused” |
| Revision by partial waking thought | `partial_waking_revision` | Only part similar to waking thought | “revision… partially roused conscious thought” |
| Presentability constraint | `presentability_constraint` | Requirement to use perceptual traces | “visual and acoustic traces… regard for presentability” |

**Factor Status**: `new_candidate`

## L4 - Cross-System Bridge Layer

### L4.3 Neutral Semantic Tag Mapping

| neutral_tag | Mapping Rationale | Applicability Limits |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `Secondary_Elaboration` | Names the coherence overlay | Hard to separate from normal narrative recall biases |
| `Representational_Constraint` | Names the perceptual rendering constraint | Depends on assumptions about dream imagery formation |
| `Censorship` | Names the distortion driver in Freud’s model | Not universally accepted outside psychoanalytic framework |

## L6 - Meta-Reflection Layer

### L6.2 Uncertainty Annotation

| Layer | Uncertainty | Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| L3 Extraction | `Medium` | “Secondary elaboration” overlaps with general memory/narrative reconstruction processes. |
| L4 Mapping | `High` | Cross-system mapping is weak; neutral tags are safer than system-to-system equivalences. |
