## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text** (Paradoxical Nature, [270]-[278]):
> The "child" is all that is abandoned and exposed and at the same time divinely powerful; the insignificant, dubious beginning, and the triumphal end. The "eternal child" in man is an indescribable experience, an incongruity, a handicap, and a divine prerogative. It is a symbol of the uniting of opposites, a mediator, bringer of healing, that is, one who makes whole.
