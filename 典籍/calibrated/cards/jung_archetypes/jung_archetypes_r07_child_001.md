## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Paradoxical Nature** ([270]-[278]):
> The "child" is all that is abandoned and exposed and at the same time divinely powerful; the insignificant, dubious beginning, and the triumphal end. The "eternal child" in man is an indescribable experience, an incongruity, a handicap, and a divine prerogative.

**Function** ([278]):
> The child motif represents the preconscious, childhood aspect of the collective psyche. [...] It is a symbol of the uniting of opposites, a mediator, bringer of healing, that is, one who makes whole.

**Special Phenomenology** ([284]-[300]):
1. Abandonment of the child (heroic beginning)
2. Invincibility of the child (miraculous survival)
3. Hermaphroditism (union of opposites)
4. Child as beginning and end (futurity + wholeness)

**Context Analysis**:

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Preceding context | Rebirth theme; child as product of rebirth process |

### L3.2 Rule Extraction

```
IF <child imagery appears in dreams/fantasies>
AND <context suggests transformation/individuation>
THEN <interpret as self-anticipation>
  - Abandonment = necessary separation from origin
  - Invincibility = essential nature survives
  - Hermaphroditism = integration of opposites
WITH confidence = High
BECAUSE <Jung, "Child Archetype," [278], [284]-[300]>
