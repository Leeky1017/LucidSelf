## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Trickster Nature** ([456]-[460]):
> It is no light task for me to write about the figure of the trickster in American Indian mythology. [...] A curious combination of typical trickster motifs can be found in the alchemical figure of Mercurius; for instance, his fondness for sly jokes and malicious pranks, his powers as a shape-shifter.

**Collective Shadow** ([484]-[485]):
> The trickster is a collective shadow figure, a summation of all the inferior traits of character in individuals. And since the individual shadow is never absent as a component of personality, the collective figure can construct itself out of it continually.

**Therapeutic Function** ([478]-[480]):
> From this point of view we can see why the myth of the trickster was preserved and developed: like many other myths, it was supposed to have a therapeutic effect. It holds the earlier low intellectual and moral level before the eyes of the more highly developed individual.

**Transformation** ([472]-[477]):
> He is a forerunner of the saviour, and, like him, God, man, and animal at once. He is both subhuman and superhuman, a bestial and divine being.
