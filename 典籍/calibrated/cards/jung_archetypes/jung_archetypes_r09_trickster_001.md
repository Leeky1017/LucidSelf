## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text** (Collective Shadow, [484]-[485]):
> The trickster is a collective shadow figure, a summation of all the inferior traits of character in individuals. And since the individual shadow is never absent as a component of personality, the collective figure can construct itself out of it continually.

**Source Text** (Therapeutic Function, [478]-[480]):
> Like many other myths, it was supposed to have a therapeutic effect. It holds the earlier low intellectual and moral level before the eyes of the more highly developed individual.

**Source Text** (Savior Foreshadowing, [472]-[477]):
> He is a forerunner of the saviour, and, like him, God, man, and animal at once. He is both subhuman and superhuman, a bestial and divine being.
