## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Key Definition** ([148]-[149]):
> The concept of the Great Mother belongs to the field of comparative religion and embraces widely varying types of mother-goddess. [...] Like any other archetype, the mother archetype appears under an almost infinite variety of aspects.

**Ambivalent Nature** ([158]):
> The qualities associated with it are maternal solicitude and sympathy; the magic authority of the female; the wisdom and spiritual exaltation that transcend reason; any helpful instinct or impulse; [...] all that is benign, all that cherishes and sustains, that fosters growth and fertility. The place of magic transformation and rebirth, together with the underworld and its inhabitants, are presided over by the mother. On the negative side the mother archetype may connote anything secret, hidden, dark; the abyss, the world of the dead, anything that devours, seduces, and poisons.

**Context Analysis**:

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Preceding context | Follows methodological essays; provides first detailed archetype study in volume. |
| Following direction | Leads to Rebirth archetype; mother archetype contains transformation potential. |
| Overall positioning | Most clinically oriented essay; addresses therapeutic implications of mother-complex. |

### L1.2 Historical Background and Academic Lineage

| Dimension | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Writing context | 1938 (pre-WWII); revised 1954. Eranos lecture addressing psychological understanding of maternal imagery. |

| Premises | `Reasonable` | Ambivalence of mother imagery is cross-culturally documented |

| Klein, object relations | Good/bad breast splitting | `Complementary` - different theoretical frame, similar observation |

### L2.3 Limitations

| Dimension | Content |
|:---|:---|
| Applicable | Mother-complex analysis; cross-cultural mother symbolism; transformation work |
| Inapplicable | When personal mother is the actual issue; when cultural specificity matters |
| Modern corrections | Feminist critiques; father-absence/presence considerations; cultural variations |
