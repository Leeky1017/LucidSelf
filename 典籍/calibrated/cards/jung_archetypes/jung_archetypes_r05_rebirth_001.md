## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Five Forms of Rebirth** ([199]-[207]):
1. **Metempsychosis**: Transmigration of souls (lives as sequence of incarnations)
2. **Reincarnation**: Continuity of personality through incarnations
3. **Resurrection**: Re-establishment of human existence after death
4. **Rebirth (renovatio)**: Within lifespan, through healing, conversion, or magical change
5. **Participation mystique**: Transformation through participation in ritual/group

**Subjective Transformation Types** ([206]-[207]):
- Diminution of personality (possession, loss of soul)
- Enlargement of personality (identification with group/hero)
- Change of internal structure (individuation)

**Context Analysis**:

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Preceding context | Mother archetype contains womb/transformation symbolism; rebirth elaborates transformation theme |
| Following direction | Leads to Child Archetype (rebirth's product); individuation as rebirth process |
| Overall positioning | Bridges archetypal symbolism with personal psychological experience |
