> Individuation is the process by which an individual differentiates from collective norms and integrates unconscious contents to become a unique, whole personality—not through ego-inflation or isolation, but through the realization of the self as the totality of conscious and unconscious psyche.

## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Definition** ([489]-[490]):
> The relation between the conscious and the unconscious on the one hand, and the individuation process on the other, is one of the most important problems facing psychology.

**Differentiation from Collective** ([494]-[498]):
> Individuation means becoming an "in-dividual," and, in so far as "individuality" embraces our innermost, last, and incomparable uniqueness, it also implies becoming one's own self. We could therefore translate individuation as "coming to selfhood" or "self-realization."

**Self as Totality** ([503]-[507]):
> The self is not only the centre but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the centre of this totality, just as the ego is the centre of consciousness.

**Not Ego-Inflation** ([512]-[515]):
> Individuation does not shut one out from the world, but gathers the world to oneself. [...] A conscious distinction must be made between the ego and the self.

| Dimension | Analysis |

### L3.2 Rule Extraction

**Rule ID**: `rule_jung_individuation`

```
IF <individual differentiates from collective norms>
AND <integrates unconscious contents (shadow, anima, etc.)>
AND <maintains ego-consciousness without inflation>
THEN <individuation process is underway>
  - Goal: self-realization (not ego-expansion)
  - Method: conscious encounter with archetypes
  - Result: unique wholeness, not isolation
WITH confidence = High
BECAUSE <Jung, "Conscious, Unconscious, and Individuation," [489]-[515]>
