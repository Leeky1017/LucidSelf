### Core Thesis in One Sentence

## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Definition of Spirit** ([384]-[394]):
> One of the unbreakable rules in scientific research is to take an object as known only so far as the inquirer is in a position to make scientifically valid statements about it. [...] "Spirit" in the psychological sense means something whose nature is dynamic and active.

**Wise Old Man Function** ([398]-[406]):
> The old man appears when the hero is in a hopeless and desperate situation from which only profound reflection or a lucky idea can extricate him. [...] The old man represents knowledge, reflection, insight, wisdom, cleverness, and intuition on the one hand, and on the other, moral qualities such as goodwill and readiness to help.

**Moral Ambivalence** ([420]-[425]):
> The figure of the wise old man can appear so plastically, not only as a real human being, but also as dwarf or animal, that it presents a problem whether we are dealing with a figure or a symbol. [...] Even his dwarf form has its parallel in alchemy as the homunculus, and in folklore in the form of the little metal men.

**Context Analysis**:

| Dimension | Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| Preceding context | Child/Kore represent potential; Spirit provides guidance toward realization |
| Following direction | Leads to Trickster (Spirit's shadow aspect); Individuation (Spirit's goal) |
| Overall positioning | Most extensive treatment of Wise Old Man; connects to alchemy (Mercurius) |
