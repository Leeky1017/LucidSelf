## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Source Text** (Wise Old Man Function, [398]-[406]):
> The old man appears when the hero is in a hopeless and desperate situation from which only profound reflection or a lucky idea can extricate him. [...] The old man represents knowledge, reflection, insight, wisdom, cleverness, and intuition on the one hand, and on the other, moral qualities such as goodwill and readiness to help.

**Source Text** (Moral Ambivalence, [420]-[425]):
> Even his dwarf form has its parallel in alchemy as the homunculus, and in folklore in the form of the little metal men.
