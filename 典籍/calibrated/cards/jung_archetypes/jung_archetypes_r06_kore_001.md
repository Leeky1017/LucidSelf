### Core Thesis in One Sentence

## L1 - Deep Comprehension Layer

### L1.1 Source Text and Context

**Demeter-Kore Unity** ([306]-[311]):
> Not only is the figure of Demeter and the Kore in its threefold aspect as maiden, mother, and hecate, not to be thought of as the mere conscious product of Greek genius, but must be regarded as an archetypal image of the maternal substance which underlies the psyche.

**Supraordinate Personality** ([314]-[316]):
> The figure of the Kore belongs to the realm of the anima-type. [...] But since the anima-figure has a similar structure and undergoes similar symbolic developments, it is this that gives the Kore her mythological significance.
