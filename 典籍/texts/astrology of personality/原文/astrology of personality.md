## PREFACE	TO	THE	THIRD	EDITION
(1970)

When	 this	 book	 was	 written,	 following	 a	 series	 of	 articles	 appearing	 in	 the
magazine	American	Astrology	which	had	just	been	published	and	edited	by	Paul
Clancy,	astrology	interested	relatively	few	people.	It	was	associated	in	the	public
mind	 either	 with	 fortune-telling	 of	 the	 most	 superficial	 type,	 or	 with
Rosicrucians,	 Theosophists,	 or	 Hermetists.	 The	 most	 well-known	 English
astrologers,	Sepharial	and	Alan	Leo,	had	been	occultists	and	Theosophists;	and	it
was	in	such	circles	that	I	first	heard	of	and	studied	astrology	just	fifty	years	ago.
Ten	 years	 later	 I	 received	 the	 first	 mimeographed	 courses	 on	 astrology	 by
Marc	 Edmund	 Jones,	 and	 soon	 afterward	 became	 deeply	 interested	 in	 Carl
Jung’s	depth-psychology	and	also	in	the	book	Holism	and	Evolution	written	by
the	great	South	African	statesman,	internationalist	and	philosopher,	Ian	Smuts.	It
occurred	to	me	then	that	astrology	could	be	used	in	close	connection	with	depth-
psychology	if	it	were	considered	in	a	new	light	and	if	many	of	its	basic	concepts
were	reformulated	so	as	to	fit	the	mentality	and	the	experiences	of	the	modern
men	and	women	of	our	post-World	War	I	society.	I	communicated	my	ideas	to
Paul	Clancy	whom	I	met	in	New	York	after	corresponding	with	him	for	a	couple
of	 years,	 and	 he	 responded	 enthusiastically	 and	 offered	 to	 publish	 anything	 I
wanted	 to	 write	 in	 his	 magazine.	 A	 few	 months	 later	 American	 Astrology
obtained	national	distribution;	the	sales	increased	rapidly,	and	so	did	the	size	of
the	 magazine	 and	 Clancy’s	 request	 for	 more	 articles.	 A	 Psychological	 Section
was	started	in	the	magazine,	and	I	wrote	at	least	two	long	articles	every	month.
Later	 on	 I	 was	 asked	 by	 Grant	 Lewi	 to	 contribute	 to	 Horoscope	 —also	 two
articles	 monthly—and	 other	 magazines	 followed	 suit	 as	 astrology	 grew	 in
popularity.

The	popularization	of	astrology	had	important	implications.	It	meant	that	the
magazines,	 the	newspaper	 columns	and	even	most	textbooks	had	to	emphasize
the	 “Sun-sign”	 approach;	 that	 is,	 a	 type	 of	 astrology	 based	 on	 the	 birthday	 of

individuals.	 As	 a	 result	 people	 began	 to	 say	 “I	 am	 a	 Leo.	 What	 is	 your	 sign?”
This	meant	that	general	yet	definite	psychological	characteristics	had	to	be	given
to	the	twelve	signs	of	the	zodiac	and	the	Sun	in	a	chart	had	to	be	considered	as
the	most	dominant	or	basic	factor.

There	 is	 not,	 however,	 only	 one	 kind	 of	 psychology;	 and	 so	 the
psychological	 interpretation	 of	 the	 signs	 and	 the	 characterization	 of	 twelve
zodiacal	 Types	 of	 human	 beings	 could	 develop	 at	 several	 levels.	 Many
astrologers	 were	 simply	 following	 the	 type	 of	 psychology	 outlined	 in	 old
textbooks,	some	stressed	a	more	“social”	type	of	psychology.	Quite	a	few	have
followed	 my	 approach	 in	 which	 I	 have	 tried	 to	 combine	 depth-psychology	 and
holistic	philosophy	(both	of	which	emphasize	the	integration	of	the	personality)
together	 with	 some	 of	 the	 most	 revealing	 and	 fecund	 vistas	 of	 occultism	 and
Oriental	metaphysics.

Thus	 this	book,	 The	Astrology	of	 Personality,	 came	 at	 a	 crucial	 time	 in	 the
evolution	 of	 a	 modern	 astrology	 when,	 in	 answer	 to	 the	 popularization	 of	 this
ancient	 “art,”	 not	 only	 was	 a	 deeper	 psychological	 approach	 needed,	 but	 it
became	essential	to	gain	a	more	sound	perspective	on	how	astrology	was	related
to	the	new	types	of	thought	which	had	developed	along	the	lines	of	philosophy
and	science.	Today,	thirty-five	years	later,	as	this	book	is	about	to	reach	a	larger
public,	 astrology	 faces	 a	 crisis;	 one	 might	 say	 a	 crisis	 in	 consciousness.	 This
crisis	 is	 caused	 by	 the	 vast	 expansion	 of	 the	 interest	 in	 astrology,	 an	 interest
which	has	touched	both	the	new	youth,	and	also	college	intellectuals.

The	 young	 people	 have	 become	 fascinated	 with	 Oriental	 philosophies	 and
yoga	 practices,	 with	 transcendent	 experiences	 and	 all	 the	 new	 forms	 of
“sensitivity	training”	and	natural	living.	They	hope	to	find	in	astrology	not	only
answers	 to	 their	 poignant	 personal	 problems	 but	 even	 more	 some	 sort	 of	 inner
security.	 Many	 of	 them,	 having	 broken	 away	 from	 their	 family	 traditions	 and
refusing	to	participate	in	a	culture	increasingly	dominated	by	a	dehumanized	and
de-natured	 approach	 to	 knowledge,	 to	 social	 organization,	 and	 to	 interpersonal
relationships,	 long	 to	 discover	 their	 place	 and	 function	 in	 a	 more-than-human,
universal	or	cosmic	order.	They	want	to	know	where	they	“belong,”	what	they
“really	are”	when	the	ego-games	are	played	out.	Alas,	the	majority	of	astrologers
are	 still	 too	 close	 to	 the	 fortune-telling	 category,	 too	 obsessed	 by	 telling	 “what
will	happen,”	to	be	able	to	answer	the	needs	of	the	young	rebels.

However,	 there	 is	 another	 type	 of	 young	 people	 who	 are	 fascinated	 by
science	 and	 technology,	 by	 computers	 and	 moonflights.	 They	 are	 aware	 that

scientists	 are	 more	 and	 more	 concerned	 with	 the	 solar	 system	 as	 the	 “cosmic
environment”	of	our	planet,	with	solar	radiations	and	even	galactic	forces.	They
are	often	familiar	with	statistical	techniques	and	all	kinds	of	psychological	tests.
They	 are	 intellectually	 curious,	 ambitious	 and,	 even	 if	 they	 find	 fault	 with	 our
society,	they	are	eager	to	get	to	the	top	of	the	social	and	economic	ladder.	They
want	 to	 be	 progressive,	 future-oriented,	 builders	 of	 the	 glorious	 technological
society	which	they	see	arising.	They	are	more	and	more	intrigued	or	fascinated
by	 astrology;	 but	 they	 realize	 it	 has	 to	 become	 “scientific”	 in	 order	 to	 be
acceptable	 to	 the	 intellectual	 Establishment	 and	 officially	 taught	 for	 credits	 in
our	colleges.

To	 this	 science-oriented	 group	 the	 approach	 to	 astrology	 promoted	 by	 the
Irish	astrologer	and	scholar,	Cyril	Fagan,	and	popularized	by	his	monthly	articles
in	 American	 Astrology	 for	 the	 last	 twenty	 years,	 has	 a	 great	 appeal.	 It	 is	 Mr.
Fagan’s	 contention	 that	 the	 zodiac	 which	 has	 been	 in	 use	 in	 Europe	 since	 the
days	 of	 the	 Greco-Latin	 civilization—the	 tropical	 zodiac—is	 inaccurate.	 He
claims	that	the	only	true	zodiac	is	the	sidereal	zodiac.

The	 tropical	 zodiac	 is	 based	 on	 the	 apparent	 motion	 of	 the	 Sun	 in	 the	 sky
from	 one	 vernal	 equinox	 to	 the	 next.	 It	 refers	 to	 the	 annual	 cycle	 of	 the	 ever-
changing	relationship	of	the	earth-globe	to	the	Sun,	source	of	all	energies	on	this
earth—that	is,	to	the	cycle	of	the	seasons.	The	“sidereal”	zodiac	also	deals	with
the	annual	apparent	motion	of	the	Sun,	but	with	reference	to	the	constellations,
i.e.	 to	 actual	 groupings	 of	 stars.	 Because	 of	 the	 phenomenon	 called	 “the
precession	of	the	equinoxes”—a	backward	shift	in	the	position	of	the	equinoxes
with	 reference	 to	 the	 nearly	 “fixed”	 stars	 —these	 two	 zodiacs	 do	 not	 now
coincide.	They	did	coincide	at	a	time	variously	estimated	from	around	300	B.C	to
A.D.	500;	the	differences	being	due	to	the	fact	that	there	is	no	astronomical	way	to
precisely	 define	 the	 boundaries	 of	 the	 heterogenous	 groups	 of	 stars	 called
“constellations.”

At	a	time	when	so	much	stress	is	put	upon	the	signs,	not	the	 constellations,
of	 the	 zodiac,	 in	 which	 the	 Sun	 is	 found	 at	 a	 person’s	 birth,	 the	 claims	 of	 the
“siderealists”	upset	most	of	the	characterizations	of	the	zodiacal	Types.	A	great
deal	of	confusion	is	thus	created.	But	actually	the	issue	goes	deeper.	What	is	at
stake	 behind	 the	 controversy	 concerning	 the	 validity	 of	 a	 tropical	 or	 a	 sidereal
zodiac	 is	 the	 basic	 attitude	 one	 takes	 toward	 astrology.	 The	 “siderealists”
consider	astrology	an	empirical	science,	whose	one	 basic	function	 is	to	predict
the	 statistically	 measurable	 probability	 of	 precise	 events.	 This	 science	 is

supposed	 to	 have	 originated	 long	 ago,	 perhaps	 in	 Egypt,	 and	 to	 have	 been
developed	 further	 in	 Chaldea;	 and	 from	 there	 it	 was	 brought	 to	 the	 Hellenistic
world.	The	siderealist	claims	that	it	was	born	strictly	as	a	science	of	observation,
relating	 the	 coincidence	 between	 actual	 events	 on	 earth	 to	 such	 celestial
phenomena	 as	 the	 appearances	 of	 stars	 at	 the	 horizon,	 planetary	 conjunctions,
etc.	Gradually	a	 body	of	classified	 recorded	 correlations	 would	thus	have	been
built	in	a	true	scientific	manner.	But	confusion	occurred	in	the	first	centuries	A.D.
when	 a	 seasonal,	 equinoctial	 frame	 of	 reference	 was	 substituted	 for	 the	 “true”
pattern	of	constellations.

Anything	presented	in	such	a	“scientific”	manner	is	bound	to	appeal	to	many
people	 today.	 This	 is	 not	 the	 place	 to	 discuss	 the	 validity	 of	 this	 siderealist
picture,	but	it	does	not	seem	to	accord	with	the	way	in	which	the	archaic	mind
operated	 before,	 let	 us	 say,	 1000	 B.C.,	 and	 one	 should	 always	 be	 careful	 not	 to
project	 our	 present-day	 intellectual	 processes	 upon	 the	 mentality	 that	 produced
ancient	 symbols	 and	 myths.	 The	 essential	 point,	 as	 I	 see	 it,	 is	 whether,
considering	astrology	as	such	a	kind	of	age-old	empirical	and	essentially	Events-
Oriented	science	fills	the	psychological	need	of	our	present	humanity-—the	need
which	has	made	astrology	so	popular	today.

Because	I	do	not	believe	that	this	type	of	astrology	is	what	we	need	today,	I
have	 recently	 formed	 an	 International	 Committee	 of	 Humanistic	 Astrology
(I.C.H.A.)	 which	 intends	 to	 link	 people	 who	 are	 interested	 in	 a	 different
approach	to	astrology,	a	person-oriented	approach.	It	is	a	“humanistic”	approach,
not	 in	 the	 sense	 of	 a	 traditional	 humanism	 often	 associated	 with	 atheism,	 but
rather	in	accordance	with	the	meaning	given	to	the	word	by	Abraham	Maslow,
founder	of	what	is	known	as	Humanistic	psychology.	This	type	of	psychology	is
neither	 Freudian,	 nor	 Behavioristic	 or	 Clinical.	 For	 this	 reason	 it	 is	 also	 called
Third	 Force	 psychology.	 It	 seeks	 to	 help	 and	 guide	 individuals	 regarded	 as
developing,	aspiring,	self-actualizing	persons	who	at	times	may	reach	moments
of	exalted	spiritual	consciousness	in	“peak-experiences.”

In	 a	 similar	 sense	 what	 I	 conceive	 as	 Humanistic	 astrology	 is	 an	 astrology
which	 assists	 individuals	 in	 the	 solution	 of	 their	 personal	 and	 interpersonal
problems,	 and	 especially	 in	 actualizing	 more	 fully	 their	 birth-potential.	 In	 this
type	 of	 astrology,	 no	 planet	 and	 no	 aspect	 is	 in	 itself	 “good”	 or	 “bad.”	 Every
birth-chart	 is	 as	 “good”	 as	 any	 other,	 in	 the	 sense	 that	 it	 symbolizes	 what	 the
person	 potentially	 is	 and	 what	 he	 is	 meant	 to	 achieve,	 if	 he	 follows	 the
“instructions”	 which,	 as	 it	 were,	 are	 “coded”	 in	 the	 pattern	 of	 the	 sky,	 as	 seen

from	the	place	and	at	the	exact	moment	of	birth.

Such	an	astrology	is	not	an	empirical	science.	It	is	a	“language”	which	can
reveal	 the	 archetype	 of	 what	 the	 total	 person	 (body,	 mind,	 feelings,	 etc.)
essentially	 is—the	 “Form”	 of	 his	 or	 her	 individuality.	 What	 we	 vaguely	 and
confusingly	 call	 “destiny”	 is	 simply	 the	 process	 of	 actualization	 of	 the
potentialities	 abstractly	 formulated	 in	 the	 birth-chart.	 Man,	 conceived	 as	 a
transcendent	Soul,	is	not	outside	the	chart	and	having	to	“rule”	it	in	order	to	lead
a	“good”	life.	He	is,	as	an	existential	living	and	thinking-feeling	organism,	what
the	 chart	 indicates	 he	 might	be;	 indeed	 what	 he	 should	be	 if	 he	 lives	 “in	 tune
with	the	universe.”

When	 I	 wrote	 The	 Astrology	 of	 Personality	 thirty-five	 years	 ago	 I	 was	 not
quite	aware	of	the	problems	that	might	confront	the	growth	of	astrology;	and	no
one	certainly	expected	that	it	would	develop	such	a	wide	appeal	to	the	modern
mind.	I	still	accepted	some	traditional	concepts	which	even	the	pioneering	mind
of	Marc	Jones	had	taken	for	granted.	Astrology	has	been	essentially	geocentric,
even	if	it	accepted	some	ideas	belonging	to	the	heliocentric	picture	of	the	solar
system.	I	see	now	that	when	it	deals	with	human	beings	as	individuals,	it	should
be	“person-centered,”	for	each	individual	is	in	a	very	real	sense	the	center	of	his
own	 universe.	 It	 is	 the	 way	 he	 orients	 himself	 to	 the	 universe	 as	 a	 whole	 that
matters.	 In	 a	 deeper	 sense,	 he	 is	 the	whole	sky	focused	 at	 a	 particular	 point	 of
space-time.	 What	 differentiates	 him	 from	 other	 individuals	 is	 this	 particular
space-time	 formula;	 what	 identifies	 him	 with	 every	 other	 being	 is	 that	 it	 is	 the
same	sky,	the	same	Sun,	Moon,	planets	and	stars	which	constitute	the	substance
of	his	being.	Form	differentiates;	substance	unifies.

Because	 my	 philosophical-cosmic	 and	 humanistic	 approach	 was	 not	 yet
clearly	defined	in	1934-35,	and	because	I	was	influenced	by	beliefs	and	images
belonging	to	the	Theosophical-occult	tradition,	there	are	in	this	book	quite	a	few
interpretations	 and	 statements	 which	 I	 would	 not	 formulate	 today	 in	 the	 same
way.	 A	 detailed	 revision	 of	 this	 large	 volume	 would	 consume	 more	 time	 and
energy	than	I	have	at	this	late	stage	of	my	life.	Yet	the	constant	demand	for	the
book	makes	it	imperative	at	this	crucial	time	of	the	evolution	of	astrology	that	it
should	be	spread	widely	through	a	paperback	edition.

I	 should	 mention,	 however,	 the	 change	 in	 my	 approach	 to	 the	 fundamental
character	of	the	natal	Houses,	and	I	have	discussed	the	reasons	for	such	a	change
in	a	number	of	more	recent	books	and	articles.	For	a	time,	when	I	began	to	study
carefully	 the	 meaning	 of	 all	 the	 tools	 used	 in	 astrology,	 I	 accepted	 the	 then

widely-used	 idea	 according	 to	 which	 the	 houses	 are	 produced	 by	 the	 daily
rotation	 of	 the	 earth-globe;	 thus,	 the	 natal	 horizon	 is	 seen	 moving	 every	 day
around	 the	 zodiac	 and	 the	 rotation	 of	 the	 globe	 around	 its	 axis	 defines	 the
houses,	 just	 as	 the	 earth’s	 revolution	 around	 the	 Sun	 defines	 the	 signs	 of	 the
zodiac.	 Everything	 is	 in	 movement;	 and	 astrology	 deals	 with	 time	 values,	 with
cycles.

This	 is	 true,	 yet	 there	 is	 also	 space;	 and	 I	 believe,	 that	 which	 remains
constant	 in	 every	 human	 being.	 Every	 person	 is	 inherently	 an	 individual	 self,
with	 a	 particular	 rhythm	 (or	 “tone”)	 of	 being	 and	 with	 an	 orientation	 to	 the
universe	which	defines	what	I	call	now	his	“individuality,”	the	“seed	pattern	of
his	 individual	 being.”	 This	 is	 his	 “place	 in	 space.”	 It	 is	 the	 way	 he	 becomes
aware	 of	 his	 own	 self	 and	 of	 his	 capacity	 for	 relationship	 with	 other	 selves.
Every	human	being	is	born	at	the	center	of	his	own	space;	and	it	is	that	space	to
which	the	circle	of	houses	refers.

The	 circle,	 of	 course,	 turns	 in	 time,	 and	 we	 can	 speak	 of	 the	 “wheel	 of
houses”.	 But	 there	 is	 a	 fundamental	 space-orientation	 which	 remains	 as	 a
permanent	“Image”	of	individual	selfhood,	and	this	is	the	most	important	factor
in	an	astro-psychology	that	deals,	not	primarily	with	external	events,	but	with	the
innate	potential	of	individual	existence	in	every	human	being.	Let	me	repeat	that
the	purpose	of	this	astro-psychology	is	to	help	the	person	to	actualize	this	innate
potential,	to	bring	what	is	only	possible	to	an	at	least	relatively	complete	state	of
fulfillment.	 It	 is	 clear	 that	 the	 vast	 majority	 of	 human	 beings,	 not	 only	 do	 not
experience	 such	 a	 state	 of	 fulfillment,	 but	 remain	 in	 nearly	 total	 ignorance	 of
what	 one	 may	 call,	 using	 a	 phrase	 popularized	 by	 Zen	 Buddhism,	 their
“fundamental	nature.”

The	 reader	 will	 find	 such	 ideas	 expressed	 in	 this	 book,	 but	 perhaps	 not	 as
clearly	 as	 should	 be.	 I	 now	 conceive	 the	 natal	 houses	 most	 definitely	 as	 30-
degree	sections	of	the	space	surrounding	the	natal	act	of	individualization,	i.e.,
the	first	breath	that	establishes	the	individual	rhythm	of	the	newborn.	The	houses
are	 not	 in	 the	 zodiac;	 but	 it	 is	 the	 signs	 of	 the	 zodiac	 and	 all	 celestial	 bodies
which	find	their	location	in	this	or	that	house.	As	a	result,	the	Placidus	system	of
house-determination,	 which	 is	 still	 mostly	 in	 use,	 does	 not	 fit	 in	 with	 such	 an
approach,	 for	 it	 is	 based	 on	 a	 time-factor.	 The	 Campanus	 system,	 on	 the	 other
hand,	 is	 a	 space-based	 method	 of	 calculating	 the	 longitude	 of	 the	 cusps	 of	 the
house,	 and	 I	 am	 therefore	 using	 it	 and	 finding	 it	 more	 and	 more	 revealing	 in
astro-psychological	 practice,	 even	 though	 it	 is	 certainly	 not	 the	 best	 possible
system.

Before	I	conclude	this	new	Preface	and	lest	my	attitude	toward	“astrology	as
a	science”	be	misunderstood,	let	me	say	that	I	have	very	little	doubt	that	sooner
or	later	a	new	science	will	be	built	that	will	deal	with	cosmic	electro-magnetic
fields,	 cosmic	 vibrations	 and	 their	 effect	 upon	 the	 earth’s	 biosphere.	 It	 may	 be
that	 some	 of	 the	 younger	 astrologers	 who	 try	 so	 hard	 to	 be	 “scientific”	 are
working	 toward	 such	 a	 goal,	 but	 I	 do	 not	 think	 that	 when	 such	 a	 science	 is
established	it	will	be	any	more	what	has	been	traditionally	known	as	“astrology”
than	 modern	 chemistry	 is	 alchemy.	 A	 truly	 “sidereal”	 and	 scientific	 astrology
would	be	one	which	takes	the	whole	galaxy	as	its	frame	of	reference	and	which,
for	 instance,	 deals	 with	 the	 ever-changing	 relationship	 between	 the	 earth-
equatorial	 plane	 and	 the	 plane	 of	 the	 galaxy.	 It	 would	 substitute	 actual	 star-
groups	 and	 their	 relative	 motions	 for	 the	 old	 type	 of	 zodiacal	 mythology	 that
relies	solely	on	pictorial	and	symbolic	man-made	constellations.	We	may	learn,
of	 course,	 from	 the	 archaic	 past	 of	 humanity;	 but	 it	 should	 be	 the	 whole	 of
humanity,	including,	for	instance,	the	Chinese	and	Mayan	cultures.

Besides,	 it	 is	 my	 belief	 that	 each	 great	 culture	 inevitably	 develops	 its	 own
approach	to	the	universe,	its	own	cosmology	and	astrology;	and	I	do	not	see	why
our	 Western	 civilization,	 with	 its	 roots	 in	 the	 Greco-Latin	 and	 the	 Hebrew
tradition,	should	not	have	developed	its	own	approach	to	astrology.	This	Western
civilization	may	very	well	be	nearing	the	end	of	its	cycle,	and	I	feel	that	both	the
protesting	 Hippie	 youth	 and	 the	 technologically	 oriented	 young	 college-
graduates	are	contributing	to	a	new	civilization.	Ever	since	I	was	sixteen	years
old	my	life	has	been	polarized	by	an	irrevocable	decision	to	serve	in	any	way	I
could	the	forces	building	such	a	new	civilization.

Thus	I	have	no	quarrel	with	any	attempt	at	developing	a	true	and	really	new
“cosmobiology”	 or	 “cosmecology”	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 recent	 discoveries	 in
astronomy,	cosmic	physics	and	such	scientific	approaches.	But	an	“astrology	for
the	individual	person”	is	an	altogether	different	type	of	study,	even	if,	in	time,	it
proves	 related	 to	 the	 former.	 As	 I	 see	 it,	 the	 first	 and	 immediate	 purpose	 of
astrology	is	not	to	predict	events	in	terms	of	statistical	probability,	but	to	bring	to
confused,	eager,	often	distraught	persons	a	message	of	order,	of	 “form,”	of	the
meaning	 of	 individual	 life	 and	 individual	 struggles	 in	 the	 process	 of	 self-
actualization.	 We	 live	 indeed	 in	 a	 new	 jungle,	 social	 as	 well	 as	 psychological;
and,	as	our	archaic	ancestors	faced	by	everyday	dangers	and	uncertainty	looked
to	the	magnificent	and	ordered	pageant	of	lights	revealed	by	the	night-sky,	so	we
should,	in	our	more	abstract	modern	way,	seek	to	discover	in	our	own	individual

birth-sky	and	its	progressive	transformations	a	truly	cosmic	peace	and	certitude,
regardless	of	outer	chaos.

In	closing	may	I	stress	the	fact	that	in	this	book	the	word	“personality”	has
not	 the	 negative	 or	 lower-level	 meaning	 that	 esotericists	 and	 New	 Thought
people	 usually	 attach	 to	 it.	 I	 am	 using	 it	 as	 the	 philosopher	 Ian	 Smuts	 and	 the
psychologist	Carl	Jung	use	it.	Perhaps	the	following	few	sentences,	which	were
included	in	the	Prefaces	of	the	first	and	second	edition	of	this	book,	will	make
this	point	clear.

“Personality,	 in	 the	 largest	 sense,	 is	 the	 organic	 whole	 in	 which	 the
physiological	and	the	psycho-mental	natures	of	man	are	progressively	integrated.
Therefore	it	represents	the	wholeness	of	the	human	being	as	a	microcosm;	man

## PREFACE	TO	THE	1991	EDITION

The	 book	 you	 are	 now	 holding	 was	 described	 on	 its	 flyleaf	 in	 1936	 by	 Paul
Clancy	 as	 “the	 greatest	 step	 forward	 in	 Astrology	 since	 the	 time	 of	 Ptolemy.”1
That	 was	 no	 jovial	 publisher’s	 hype	 The	 influence	 of	 this	 book,	 often
unacknowledged,	has	been	all	pervasive,	consciously	and	unconsciously	shaping
the	way	most	thinking	astrologers	view	astrology	today.	It	is	a	classic,	but	like
all	 great	 classics	 it	 is	 still	 one	 of	 the	 most	 invigorating	 and	 seminal	 books	 you
will	 ever	 read	 on	 astrology,	 and	 always	 a	 wonderful	 stimulant	 when	 one’s
thinking	is	growing	stale,	and	should	be	at	the	top	of	any	teacher’s	reading	list.

I	was	myself	lucky	enough	to	read	The	Astrology	of	Personality	for	the	first
time	 nearly	 thirty	 years	 ago	 soon	 after	 I	 began	 seriously	 studying	 astrology	 in
### 1961.	 At	 that	 time	 my	 career	 could	 have	 gone	 in	 a	 number	 of	 different	 ways.
This	book	more	than	any	other,	convinced	me	that	astrology	was	the	subject	to
which	 I	 wanted	 to	 devote	 my	 life.	 It	 had	 exactly	 the	 same	 impact	 on	 my	 wife
Suzi.	Indeed	wherever	I	go	in	the	world	the	leading	lights	of	astrology	testify	to
the	 profound	 influence	 that	 this	 particular	 book	 of	 Rudhyar’s	 has	 had	 on	 their
thinking,	and	this	is	even	the	case	amongst	Rudhyar’s	critics.

Perhaps	the	central	importance	of	this	book	is	the	very	clear	insight	Rudhyar
presents	of	the	fundamental	nature	of	astrology,	and	the	importance	he	therefore
places	on	an	understanding	of	its	symbolic	and	formal	basis.	Rudhyar’s	vision	of
astrology	 as	 “the	 algebra	 of	 life”	 whose	 goal	 is	 the	 “alchemy	 of	 personality,”
reveals	astrology	to	be	primarily,	not	as	so	often	portrayed	as	a	traditional	body
of	 empirical	 knowledge,	 but	 as	 a	 system	 of	 symbolic	 logic,	 based	 on	 first
principles,	 which	 we	 can	 employ	 for	 understanding	 the	 underlying	 order	 and
significance	of	the	processes	of	Nature	and,	together	with	depth	psychology,	of
our	individual	natures	in	particular.

Rudhyar’s	definition	of	astrology	as	“the	algebra	of	life”	is	no	casual	image.
Rudhyar	 is	 never	 casual.	 He	 is	 deliberately	 identifying	 astrology	 with

mathematical	 thought	 as	 opposed	 to	 empirical	 knowledge	 Rudhyar	 points	 out
that	 algebra	 comes	 from	 the	 Arabic	 word	 “al-jebr”	 meaning	 the	 reduction	 of
parts	 to	 a	 whole.	 “Jabara”	 in	 fact	 means	 to	 bind	 together,	 and	 the	 function	 of
algebra	 is	 the	 binding	 together,	 correlating	 or	 integrating	 of	 elements	 into	 a
formulated	 whole.	 Rudhyar	 develops	 this	 image	 to	 show	 how	 astrology	 like
algebra	binds	together	it	symbolic	elements,	such	as	planets,	zodiacal	positions,
parts,	nodes,	etc	into	a	formula	describing	a	living	whole	Whereas	in	algebra	the
symbolic	 elements	 refer	 to	 quantities	 in	 astrology	 they	 refer	 to	 qualities,	 to
universal	 life	 qualities,	 to	 living	 processes	 on	 different	 levels	 from	 physical	 to
spiritual.

Rudhyar’s	 emphasis	 is	 a	 crucial	 one,	 for	 whilst	 no-one,	 including	 Rudhyar
himself,	 would	 deny	 the	 importance	 and	 value	 of	 observation	 and	 empirical
studies,	 (he	 himself	 was	 the	 first	 to	 advocate,	 in	 this	 book,	 the	 study	 of	 time
twins	 as	 a	 primary	 means	 of	 astrological	 research),	 we	 have	 to	 be	 clear	 that
astrology	 teaches	 about	 what	 Aristotle	 would	 have	 called	 the	 formal	 or
“informing”	 causes	 of	 things,	 and	 not	 as	 does	 most	 of	 modern	 science,	 about
their	material	causes.

Indeed,	 if	 The	 Astrology	 of	 Personality	 were	 compulsory	 reading	 for	 all
astrology	 students	 at	 an	 early	 stage	 in	 their	 education,	 we	 might	 be	 spared	 the
bizarre	 spectacle	 we	 have	 seen	 of	 late	 of	 certain	 distinguished	 astrologers	 of
empirical	bent	literally	arguing	themselves	out	of	astrology	on	the	grounds	that
certain	seemingly	water-tight	experiments	have	failed	to	demonstrate	astrology’s
objective	 reality.	 How	 Rudhyar	 would	 have	 smiled,	 and	 at	 the	 same	 time	 been
exasperated,	 at	 the	 continuing	 preoccupation	 with	 the	 need	 to	 make	 astrology
jump	 through	 certain	 predetermined	 scientific	 and	 statistical	 hoops.	 It	 would
have	 confirmed	 him	 in	 his	 decision	 in	 1969	 to	 establish	 the	 International
Committee	 for	 Humanistic	 Astrology.	 That	 is	 not	 to	 say	 that	 Rudhyar	 was
entirely	 against	 the	 empirical	 method,	 for	 it	 clearly	 has	 an	 important	 place	 to
play	in	the	development	of	knowledge,	his	concern	was	that	astrologers	should
realize	that	astrology	belongs	to	a	different	level	of	knowledge.
As	Rudhyar	spells	out	specifically	elsewhere2,	the	birthchart
“is	a	set	of	instructions	.	.	.	showing	you	how	in	your	particular	case,	the	ten	basic	energies	of	human

nature	should	be	used	to	the	best	advantage;	that	is	in	order	to	enable	you	to	consciously	work	with

### them	at	all	times.”

Such	 an	 approach	 to	 astrology	 immediately	 demands	 that	 we	 both	 become	 the
fullness	 and	 wholeness	 of	 what	 we	 are,	 and	 that	 we	 acknowledge	 the

transpersonal	in	our	lives,	i.e.	that	greater	order	and	meaning	of	the	spirit	which
flows	 through	 each	 one	 of	 us,	 that	 larger	 unity	 and	 purpose	 each	 one	 of	 us	 is
destined	 to	 serve.	 Such	 an	 approach,	 rather	 than	 reducing	 an	 individual	 to
character	 traits	 and	 life	 events,	 has	 the	 power	 to	 elevate	 us	 to	 a	 deeper
understanding	and	appreciation	of	each	unique	facet	of	the	diamond	of	life	and
our	unique	place	in,	and	relationship	to,	the	whole	scheme	of	things.

To	 those	 of	 us,	 myself	 included,	 who	 would	 argue	 that	 too	 slavish	 an
adherence	 to	 such	 an	 approach,	 with	 its	 implications	 that	 we	 already	 know	 all
that	 there	 is	 to	 be	 known	 about	 our	 symbolic	 system,	 Rudhyar	 could
immediately	point	to	the	vast	riches	of	still	unexplored	symbolic	content	that	he
was	 already	 actively	 advocating	 in	 this	 book	 which	 still	 remain	 but	 poorly
understood	or	investigated.	How	many	astrologers	as	a	matter	of	course	use	the
planetary	nodes?	How	many	even	now,	post-Addey,	regularly	use	aspects	based
on	the	numbers	5,	7,	9,	and	11?	How	many	have	thought	through	the	vast	array
of	parts,	worthy	of	Alfred	Witte,	that	Rudhyar	outlines?	Yet	as	he	unequivocally
states	“if	we	are	to	approximate	with	our	tools	for	analysis	the	infinite	variety	of
the	 connections	 to	 be	 analyzed,	 (within	 the	 psychology	 and	 physiology	 of	 the
individual)	it	is	obvious	that	nothing	short	of	the	multitude	of	Parts	can	do	the
work.”

Indeed	 how	 many	 who	 regularly	 use	 the	 Sabian	 Symbols	 and	 other	 degree
meanings	could	explain	the	symbolic	logic	by	which	the	degrees	of	 the	 zodiac
are	not	merely	sub-divisions	of	the	zodiac	but	can	be	seen	to	be	self-evidently	of
a	 supreme	 and	 deeply	 mysterious	 significance?	 Rare	 indeed	 is	 the	 astrologer
with	Rudhyar’s	illuminating	grasp	of	symbolism	as	he	shows,	(Chapter	X),	how
each	 degree	 is	 a	 reconciliation	 and	 synthesis	 of	 opposites	 of	 the	 two	 great
principles	 of	 life:	 of	 the	 individual	 and	 particular,	 represented	 by	 the	 axial
rotation	of	the	Earth,	and	the	collective	and	universal	represented	by	the	Earth’s
movement	 about	 the	 Sun.	 I	 know	 of	 no	 other	 astrologer	 who	 sheds	 such
penetrating	 insight	 and	 illumination	 on	 to	 the	 basic	 symbology	 of	 our	 art	 and
craft.

On	 a	 personal	 note,	 I	 have	 repeatedly	 found	 that	 the	 key	 to	 the	 individual
birth	 chart	 usually	 lies	 around	 a	 consideration	 of	 the	 Sun-Moon	 relationship	 in
the	birth	chart,	and	more	especially	with	the	Sun/Moon	mid-point	which	seems
to	 represent	 that	 point	 within	 the	 individual	 where	 male	 and	 female,	 conscious
and	 unconscious	 meet,	 where	 the	 mysterium	 conjunctionis	 or	 alchemical
marriage	 may	 take	 place,	 where	 we	 may	 become	 self-fertile	 and	 release	 our

maximum	 creativity	 into	 the	 world3.	 In	 Rudhyar’s	 case	 we	 find	 that	 his
Sun/Moon	 midpoint	 is	 exactly	 squared	 by	 his	 triple	 conjunction	 of	 Mars-
Neptune	and	Pluto	and	his	ASC-DSC.	It	is	this	combination	which	gives	totally
personal	and	creative	focus	to	this	formidable	array	of	individual	and	collective
energies,	and	describes	how	it	was	that	he	was	so	at	home	in	both	individual	and
collective	 realms,	 a	 natural	 visionary,	 who	 served	 as	 an	 individual	 bridge
between	 two	 worlds,	 an	 immensely	 creative	 voice	 through	 whom	 “the	 deeps
crieth	unto	the	deeps”	revealing	that	the	goal	of	all	life	is	ever	greater	wholeness
and	creativity.

In	a	hundred	years	from	now	I	have	no	doubt	that	Rudhyar’s	position	as	one
of	the	key	visionaries	and	“seeds”	of	the	20th	century	will	be	self-evident.	This
book	 was	 very	 much	 the	 seed	 of	 so	 much	 that	 was	 to	 follow	 after	 in	 his
astrological	 thinking.	 It	 was	 crucial	 to	 the	 20th	 century	 re-vitalisation	 of
astrology.	And	whilst	the	extraordinary	technological	achievements	of	mankind
during	 this	 century	 cannot	 be	 gainsaid,	 the	 regeneration	 of	 the	 astrological
perspective	at	this	time	will	be	seen	to	have	been	as	important	an	evolutionary
step	 as	 any	 of	 these	 developments	 of	 our	 understanding	 of	 the	 material	 realm.
The	 world	 will	 find	 that	 it	 owes	 much	 to	 Dane	 Rudhyar,	 and	 not	 least	 to	 The
Astrology	of	Personality.

## PROLOGUE

## PRELUDE	TO	A	HISTORY	OF	ASTROLOGY

The	history	of	astrology	is	the	history	of	the	successive	transformations	of	man’s
attitude	 to	 Nature:—external	 nature,	 perceived	 through	 sense-impressions;	 and
as	 well,	 internal	 or	 “human”	 nature,	 the	 sum	 total	 of	 those	 physiological	 and
psychological	 phenomena	 which	 somehow	 man	 calls	 his	 own;	 saying,	 “my”
body,	“my”	soul,	“my”	mind.

What	 today	 is	 usually	 called	 astrology	 is	 the	 result	 of	 a	 particular	 phase	 of
this	 relationship	 between	 man’s	 conscious	 ego	 and	 Nature.	 Though	 this	 phase
may	 have	 lasted	 hundreds	 and	 thousands	 of	 years,	 it	 was	 preceded	 by	 other
phases	of	perhaps	greater	significance;	and	the	purpose	of	this	book	is	to	show
that	 a	 new	 phase	 is	 just	 now	 beginning.	 Mankind	 is	 changing	 radically	 its
outlook	 upon	 external	 nature—witness	 the	 startlingly	 new	 concepts	 of	 modern
science	 concerning	 space,	 time,	 matter,	 and	 the	 universe.	 The	 psychological
outlook	 is	 being	 just	 as	 fundamentally	 transformed.	 Man	 is	 meeting	 “life,”
within	and	without,	on	new	terms.	Astrology	reflects	the	quality	of	this	meeting,
interprets	it	in	functions	of	actual	behavior,	gives	it	significance	in	both	a	very
fundamental	and	a	very	practical	way.	Astrology	is	the	most	significant	index	to
man’s	practical	philosophy	of	living.	Philosophy	per	se	speculates	about	life	and
man.	But	astrology,	in	every	age,	characterizes,	directly	or	indirectly,	the	deepest
quality	of	man’s	actual	response	to	life.

### Philosophies	 have	 succeeded	 philosophies.	 Likewise

the	 astrology
bequeathed	to	us	by	the	nineteenth	century	was	but	one	of	the	many	astrologies
which	 man	 has	 projected	 out	 of	 his	 need	 for	 a	 practical	 understanding	 of	 and
adjustment	to	life.	Moreover,	as	various	types	of	philosophy	have	always	existed
simultaneously	in	man’s	effort	to	interpret	reality	at	various	levels	of	thought	and
intuitive	 perception,	 so	 in	 every	 period—at	 any	 rate	 during	 historical	 times—
astrology	 has	 been	 divided	 into	 more	 exoteric	 and	 more	 esoteric	 systems.	 This
division	 must	 not,	 however,	 blind	 us	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 “esoteric”	 and	 “exoteric”
represent	 merely	 two	 ways	 of	 expressing,	 at	 any	 time,	 the	 basic	 keynote	 of	 an
epoch.	It	is	more	important	to	know	what	the	keynote	is	than	to	find	out	whether

it	is	expressed	exoterically	or	esoterically.

The	astrology	which	is	in	vogue	today	originated	almost	entirely	in	the	work
of	the	Alexandrian	astrologer,	Claudius	Ptolemy:	Tetrabiblos	(or	Four	Books	on
the	Influence	of	the	Stars).	According	to	Temple	Hungad:	“Ptolemy	was	born	at
Pelusium,	 Egypt,	 in	 the	 first	 century	 A.D.	 He	 gathered	 the	 written	 observations
left	 by	 the	 students	 of	 importance	 who	 preceded	 him,	 and	 enriched	 and
augmented	them	after	many	years	of	personal	research.	These	facts	are	set	forth
in	his	Great	Construction,	consisting	of	thirteen	books	containing	the	sum	total
of	 the	 knowledge	 on	 the	 phenomena	 of	 the	 world	 and	 the	 universe	 in	 general.
This	was	the	first	complete	and	comprehensive	document	on	the	economy	of	the
world,	and	the	ideas	therein	demonstrated	are	often	referred	to	as	the	‘Ptolemaic
System.’	 Just	 as	 did	 the	 Great	 Construction	 contain	 the	 geographical	 and
astronomical,	so	did	Ptolemy’s	Tetrabiblos	 embrace	the	astrological	 knowledge
to	be	acquired;	and,	although	written	in	Asia	during	the	first	century,	this	work
became	the	cornerstone	of	astrology	in	Europe	after	intellectual	light	had	begun
to	dawn	there.”	(A	Brief	History	of	Astrology—by	Temple	Hungad).

We	shall	return	later	to	the	 subject	of	 medieval	astrology	in	Europe,	 which
has	in	some	of	its	aspects	greater	depths	than	that	derived	from	Ptolemy;	but	our
first	task	is	to	understand	the	position	occupied	by	this	writer.	In	order	to	do	this
we	must	extend	our	inquiry	and	note	that	at	certain	periods	of	the	world-history
great	upheavals	come	which	transform	the	very	essence	of	civilization.	We	may
call	 them	 “Dark	 Ages.”	 At	 any	 rate,	 they	 are	 periods	 of	 transition	 separating
from	 each	 other	 two	 ages.	 And	 it	 is	 interesting	 to	 realize	 that	 at	 the	 very
beginning	 of	 these	 periods,	 before	 the	 “Dark	 Age”	 really	 sets	 in,	 men	 always
appear	who,	as	it	were,	sum	up	and	focalize	the	knowledge	of	the	then	closing
cycle	in	writings	(or	monuments)	which	become	the	very	seed	and	foundation	of
the	 culture	 which	 arises	 later,	 as	 the	 “Dark	 Age”	 becomes	 illumined	 by	 a	 new
spiritual-mental	vitality.

Such	 men	 become	 then	 the	 channels	 through	 which	 the	 old	 is	 conveyed	 to
the	new.	Their	works	contain	all	that	the	new	will	probably	ever	know	of	the	old;
which—and	this	is	important—does	not	mean,	however,	the	total	wisdom	of	the
old,	not	even	the	best	of	the	old,	but	only	what	the	new	will	be	able	to	assimilate
of	 the	 old.	 Numerous	 examples	 can	 be	 given.	 Confucius	 is	 the	 typical	 one,
summing	 up	 as	 he	 does	 archaic	 China.	 Archaic	 China	 is	 known	 almost	 solely
through	what	Confucius	preserved	of	it.	But,	let	us	not	forget,	it	is	archaic	China
as	Confucius	understood	it	Likewise	very	little	is	known	of	Pythagoras’	musical

ideas,	save	as	they	were	transmitted	to	us	by	his	distant	follower,	Boetius,	in	the
late	Roman	Empire.	For	a	long	time	Plato	and	Aristotle	meant	for	Europe	almost
the	 whole	 of	 Greek	 learning.	 The	 Spanish	 Kab-balists	 of	 the	 eighth	 and	 ninth
centuries	have	given	us,	as	Kabbala,	what	they	knew	and	understood	of	the	old
Hebrew	 mystery-knowledge.	 And	 in	 every	 case	 we	 know	 the	 archaic	 wisdom
and	 living	 philosophy	 only	 through	 the	 minds	 of	 men	 who,	 being	 the	 end-
products	 of	 a	 civilization,	 necessarily	 had	 lost	 the	 feeling	 of	 what	 this	 living
philosophy	and	practical	wisdom	meant	for	the	men	who	were	the	originators	of
this	civilization.

It	is	not	our	purpose	to	discuss	such	matters	at	length;	but	it	is	nevertheless
imperative	for	anyone	who	cares	to	understand	the	vital	meaning	of	astrology	to
grasp	the	above-mentioned	facts.	For	thus	only	can	be	avoided	the	tragic	mistake
of	 believing	 that	 the	 astrology	 presented	 to	 Europe	 by	 an	 intellectual
Alexandrian	 was	 the	 astrology	 which	 measured	 the	 very	 pulse	 of	 ancient
mankind.	 Ptolemaic	 astrology	 is	 the	 end-product	 of	 the	 East	 Mediterranean-
Greek	culture,	and	can	only	be	understood	in	function	of	the	intellectualism	of
this	culture.	This	intellectualism	has	moulded	the	mind	of	Europe	in	nearly	all	its
aspects.	Aristotelianism	and	Ptolemaism	are	the	results	of	this	Greek	era	after	it
had	 lost	 the	 living	 contact	 with	 the	 spiritual	 tradition	 of	 the	 Orphic	 period	 and
even	of	Pythagorean	philosophy	after	it	had	turned	away	from	the	soil	whence
archaic	man	drew	power	and	instinctive	wisdom.	If	we	want	to	understand	the
living	 essence	 of	 astrology	 we	 must	 forget	 Ptolemy	 and	 the	 type	 of	 medieval
astrology	from	which	present-day	astrology	is	mostly	derived,	and	reach	to	the
earthly	vital	depths	of	archaic	mankind.

A	 very	 remarkable	 series	 of	 articles	 by	 R.	 Berthelot,	 L’Astrobio-logie	et	la
Pensée	de	l’Asie	in	the	Revue	de	Métaphysique	et	de	Morale,	1932-1933,	which
we	 recently	 came	 across,	 is	 to	 our	 knowledge	 the	 best,	 if	 not	 the	 only	 study
which	 has	 been	 made	 of	 the	 vital	 origins	 of	 astrology.	 It	 is	 not	 made	 from	 the
astrologer’s	standpoint,	but	from	that	of	the	development	of	human	civilization
and	 human	 attitudes	 to	 life	 in	 general.	 Hence	 its	 great	 significance;	 for	 it	 is
absolutely	 useless	 to	 try	 to	 grasp	 the	 meaning	 of	 ancient	 astrology	 unless	 one
places	 astrology	 at	 the	 very	 center	 of	 the	 culture	 of	 the	 times.	 The	 so-called
“Histories	 of	 Astrology”	 today	 available	 in	 print	 are	 rather	 useless;	 are	 in	 fact
quite	 misleading.	 They	 enumerate	 a	 few	 disconnected	 facts	 and	 names	 without
giving	 any	 idea	 of	 the	 living	 reality	 of	 astrology.	 No	 wonder,	 then,	 that	 the
cultured	man	of	today	shrinks	from	considering	seriously	such	a	pseudo-science!
The	following	pages	should	not	in	any	way	be	taken	as	a	history	of	astrology,

years	 of	 research	 by	 specialists	 being	 needed	 before	 the	 scant	 data	 which	 are
scattered	in	many	books,	often	untranslated	into	any	European	language,	could
be	critically	examined,	compared	and	correlated.	What	we	wish	to	do	is	merely
to	present	a	sort	of	historical	background,	very	general	in	its	outlines,	which	will
help	the	reader	to	get	a	new	approach	to	astrology,	and	thus	to	be	better	able	to
grasp	the	meaning	of	our	re-interpretation	of	the	basic	meaning	of	astrology	as	a
living	 and	 practical	 philosophy	 of	 psychological	 fulfillment	 and	 integration.
What	the	ordinary	astrologer	offers	to	our	present	generation	is	not	only	far	from
coming	 up	 to	 the	 mental	 level	 of	 the	 intelligent	 thinker;	 it	 is,	 moreover,	 often
decidedly	 nefarious	 and	 psychologically	 disintegrating.	 The	 living	 astrology	 of
all	times	can,	however,	be	said	to	have	as	a	basic	keynote:	integration.	And	we
claim	that	any	astrology	which	does	not	bring	to	man	a	message	of	integration	is
an	adulteration	and	a	perversion	of	true	astrology.

### The	Animistic	Stage

Primitive	 man	 lives	 still	 in	 the	 womb	 of	 Nature.	 His	 entire	 life	 is	 an
experience	which	is	at	the	same	time	psychological	and	physiological,	because
he	 is	 as	 yet	 hardly	 able	 to	 differentiate	 the	 outer	 world	 from	 the	 inner,	 the
objective	 from	 the	 subjective.	 He	 is	 so	 completely	 one	 with	 Nature	 that	 he
constantly	 finds	 himself	 dissolved	 into	 natural	 phenomena,	 now	 projecting	 his
infant	 selfhood	 into	 them,	 then	 building	 them	 into	 his	 psyche	 as	 states	 of
consciousness	which	by	a	process	of	unconscious	identification	he	calls	his	own.
Levy	 Bruhl	 has	 used	 the	 term	 “participation	 mystique”	 to	 describe	 this	 or	 a
similar	process	of	psychological	identification	with	objects.*	It	corresponds	to	an
attitude	to	life	which	can	also	be	designated	by	the	word	animism.

Animism	 makes	 of	 all	 material	 objects	 “spirits,”	 and	 materializes	 psychic
facts	into	objective	entities.	Everything	is	animated	by	a	 spirit,	whether	it	 be	a
tree,	 a	 mountain,	 the	 sun,	 a	 star,	 or	 even	 instruments	 made	 by	 men,	 as	 for
instance	a	sword,	a	house.	On	the	other	hand,	every	inner	feeling	or	emotion	is
an	“astral”	entity,	which	has	come	into	the	soul,	and	which	can	be	expelled	from
it	by	appropriate	magical	practices.

Nature,	 inner	 as	 well	 as	 outer	 (both	 being	 one	 to	 the	 primitive),	 is	 thus	 a
chaos	of	entities,	acting	and	reacting	in	the	most	awe-inspiring	confusion.	It	is	a
vast	jungle	in	which	the	only	law	is	that	of	self-preservation	and	survival.	Where
physical	 strength	 fails,	 cunning	 steps	 in;	 or	 intimidation.	 Soon,	 however,	 a
certain	 sense	 of	 causality	 arises	 in	 man.	 He	 realizes	 that	 certain	 facts	 always
follow	others.	He	begins	to	“name”	not	only	things,	but	relations	between	things.

The	 only	 relation	 he	 knows	 personally	 is	 that	 of	 blood-kinship.	 Thus	 a	 crude
mythology	is	created,	where	natural	forces	and	elements	mate	and	bear	progeny.
All	 the	 while,	 however,	 the	 dominating	 emotion	 in	 primitive	 man	 is	 that
universal	 emotion	 of	 the	 jungle—fear.	 What	 one	 fears	 is	 called	 “evil.”	 Evil
entities	 must	 be	 propitiated,	 or	 overcome	 by	 ruse,	 or	 restrained	 by	 magic.	 The
main	principle	of	magic	is	that	of	“sympathetic	action.”	By	acting,	behaving	and
appearing	 as	 a	 bear	 the	 magician	 identifies	 himself	 with	 the	 bear;	 or	 rather	 he
brings	to	a	focus	the	identity	which	exists	psychologically	between	himself	and
the	bear.	Being	one	with	the	bear,	the	magician	can	thus	use	the	“bear	spirit”	to
his	 advantage	 and	 gain	 ascendancy	 (through	 this	 transfusion	 of	 instinct,	 as	 it
were)	over	any	bear.	Moreover,	he	also	comes	to	know	the	“name”	of	the	“bear
spirit”	and	thus	works	magic	in	two	ways.	First,	by	uttering	wilfully	the	name	of
the	bear	he	gains	control	over	the	bear.	Also	this	control	is	enhanced	by	the	fact
that	 generations	 of	 tribesmen	 have	 used	 this	 name	 magically,	 and	 when	 it	 is
uttered	 the	 combined	 power	 of	 those	 tribesmen	 (very	 much	 alive	 as	 ghosts	 or
spirits)	backs	up,	as	it	were,	the	magician’s	power.

At	the	animistic	stage	of	development,	man	refers	everything	to	himself	and
to	 his	 fears	 or	 his	 desires.	 He	 projects	 his	 reactions	 to	 things	 into	 the	 things
themselves,	 which	 become	 personified	 images	 of	 his	 impressions.	 If	 he	 is
moved,	 there	 must	 be	 a	 mover	 whose	 very	 nature	 is	 to	 move	 him	 in	 this	 way.
That	which	causes	fear	must	needs	be	a	fearful	being;	that	which	gives	joy	must
be	a	bounteous	entity.	In	this	sense	the	whole	life	of	man	is	psychological,	for	he
lives	in	a	world	peopled	by	the	very	projections	of	his	own	reactions;	but	these
reactions	 are	 almost	 solely	 physiological	 and	 biological.	 Thus	 psychology	 here
means	 really	 an	 extension	 of	 physiological	 reactions;	 the	 psyche	 being	 but	 a
diffuse	aura	around	the	biological	human	entity,	an	emanation	thereof.

The	 Sun	 and	 the	 Moon	 are	 known	 as	 the	 givers	 of	 light.	 Light	 and	 life
become	 inseparable,	for	darkness	and	night	but	too	often	mean	death.	Sunlight
dispels	fear,	brings	to	the	senses	a	clearer	perception	of	objects.	Thus	the	Sun	is
the	great	life-giver.	As	to	the	Moon,	it	hides	a	mystery.	It	waxes	and	wanes.	Its
light	 surrounds	 the	 jungle	 with	 an	 uncanny	 glow.	 It	 is	 changeable,	 mysterious,
like	 woman.	 Yet	 its	 phases	 are	 soon	 noted	 down.	 The	 sense	 of	 periodicity	 and
time	 is	 aroused	 by	 its	 cycles.	 “Spirits”	 are	 best	 evoked	 under	 its	 light,	 which
light	 excites	 man’s	 imagination.	 The	 Moon	 becomes	 the	 power	 of	 magic,	 the
power	of	all	mysterious	operations.

### With	the	Sun	and	the	Moon,	and	probably	later	with	the	brilliant	stars,	man

also	 feels	 a	 vague	 identity.	 He	 feels	 them,	 tries	 to	 become	 ever	 more	 one	 with
them,	to	become	instinct	with	their	essence.	Sun,	Moon,	stars	are	“great	spirits.”
Some	stars	scintillate	with	a	strange	glow.	They	seem	ominous,	evil,	as	they	rise
—like	the	eyes	of	tigers	and	panthers	seen	through	the	forest.	Stars	are	like	eyes
of	 fantastic	 animals	 in	 the	 dark	 jungle	 of	 the	 sky.	 There	 are	 men	 who	 feel
strangely	attracted	to	some	particular	stars.	Perhaps	they	were	born	as	those	rose
or	stood	high	overhead.	And	we	come	down	to	ancient	Chaldea,	or	perhaps	even
before	 in	 Atlantis,	 when	 men	 lay	 upon	 the	 ground,	 facing	 the	 stars,	 absorbing
into	 their	 souls	 the	 rays	 of	 a	 particular	 star,	 identifying	 themselves	 with	 it,	 to
know	 its	 essence	 and	 feel	 its	 exalted	 life.	 This	 star-worship	 (or	 rather	 star-
identification)	 parallels	 the	 cult	 of	 the	 totems.	Totems	 are	 mostly	 animals,	 like
the	 bear,	 the	 eagle,	 the	 deer—but	 may	 also	 be	 stars,	 and	 even	 clouds	 and
mountains.	 Totemism	 is	 still	 alive	 among	 many	 so-called	 primitive	 races,	 even
among	 the	 American	 Indians,	 and	 it	 should	 help	 us	 to	 realize	 some	 of	 the
meanings	of	archaic	astrology	at	the	animistic	stage	of	development.

Then	it	is	not,	as	later,	the	motions	of	the	celestial	bodies	which	are	the	most
important,	but	the	life-quality,	with	which	every	single	one	of	them	is	endowed.
This	 life-quality,	 the	 characteristic	 particular	 to	 the	 star-deity,	 is	 essentially
derived	from	the	quality	of	the	light	of	the	star.	Curiously	enough,	we	are	not	so
far	from	a	classification	of	stars	on	the	basis	of	spectrum	analysis!	Only	instead
of	 using	 a	 prism	 to	 determine	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 light,	 objectively	 and
analytically,	 primitive	 man	 experienced	 subjectively	 this	 light,	 and	 projected
back	into	the	star	the	result	of	this	psychic	identification.

As	for	the	Sun,	the	determination	of	the	characteristics	and	power	of	this	life-
giver	is	made	easy	by	witnessing	the	changes	which	take	place	in	the	vegetation.
But	with	this	idea	of	correspondence	between	earthly	biological	phenomena	and
the	 motion	 of	 Sun—and	 also	 of	 Moon—we	 come	 to	 a	 new	 phase	 of	 astrology
which	 may	 be	 characterized,	 following	 M.	 Berthelot’s	 example,	 by	 the	 term
vitalism.

### The	Vitalistic	Stage

According	to	the	vitalistic	conception,	 Life	is	in	everything,	interpenetrates
every	entity,	every	substance.	It	is	a	vast,	universal	ocean	of	energy	in	which	all
that	 is	 “moves	 and	 has	 its	 being.”	 This	 world-viewpoint	 originates	 in	 mankind
when	the	primordial	fear	of	nature	is	somewhat	overcome,	when	what	we	may
call	 symbolically	 the	 “jungle”	 is	 left	 behind,	 and	 men	 become	 either	 cattle-
breeders	 or	 agriculturists.	 Nature,	 in	 other	 words,	 is	 in	 the	 first	 stage	 of

domestication.	It	becomes	a	“home,”	and	within	this	home	Life	is	seen	to	flow
with	the	majestic	sweep	of	its	season,	waxing	and	waning	like	the	Moon,	ebbing
and	flowing	like	the	Nile	or	other	big	rivers	whose	waters	mean	fertility.

Animism	 reveals	 man	 as	 merely	 one	 among	 the	 myriads	 of	 entities
struggling	 for	 subsistence;	 trying	 desperately	 to	 overcome	 fear	 by	 identifying
himself	 with	 the	 feared	 object,	 or	 with	 the	 fire	 and	 the	 light	 that	 save	 his	 life,
placating	evil	by	sacrifices:	a	creature	of	chaos,	with	dim	perceptions,	yearning
for	a	grasp	of	some	sort	of	knowledge	which	will	enable	him	to	face	the	myriads
of	hostile	entities	with	equal	strength.	He	must	understand	these	entities	singly,
know	 their	 nature,	 name	 them.	 Consciousness	 gives	 power.	 Naming	 the	 foe
means	already	overcoming	it	.	.	.	which	is,	in	fact,	the	principle	back	of	Freudian
psychoanalysis,	at	another	level.	On	the	other	hand,	vitalism	presupposes	that	at
least	a	part	of	nature—within	man	as	well	as	without—is	conquered	and	utilized.
Security	of	a	sort	has	been	attained.

However,	 this	 domesticated	 part	 of	 nature	 must	 be	 watched	 carefully,
protected	 from	 evil,	 made	 fruitful.	 The	 land	 must	 be	 tilled;	 the	 cattle	 must	 be
cared	 for.	 The	 keynote	 is	 no	 longer	 exclusively	 defense,	 but	production.	 There
are	still	enemies;	but	they	do	not	attack	man	himself	as	much	as	man’s	property.
The	 problem	 of	 property	 becomes	 then	 paramount.	 Production	 depends	 on
property.	Human	life	depends	upon	the	safe-keeping	and	fructifying	of	property;
and	soon,	also,	upon	the	continual	expansion	of	property.	This	applies	also	to	the
inner	 nature	 of	 man.	 A	 portion	 of	 man’s	 being,	 or	 “psyche”	 has	 become
“domesticated,”	 that	 is,	 made	 conscious,	 prolific	 with	 ideas	 and	 knowledge.
Consciousness	 must	 be	 preserved,	 safeguarded	 against	 the	 possible	 in-rush	 of
evil	forces	from	the	“unconscious”	(the	jungle	within).	It	must	be	cultured,	just
as	the	soil	must	be	cultivated	and	the	cattle	attended	to.

Cultivation,	breeding,	culture—all	these	things	mean	one	thing:	working	in
harmony	with	and,	to	some	extent	at	least,	controlling	life-processes.	Life	in	the
jungle	state	was	mostly	a	collection	of	evil	entities.	Life	at	the	vitalistic	stage	is	a
force	 which	 can	 be	 either	 good	 or	 evil;	 a	 force	 which	 pervades	 all	 things,
operates	in	all	things.	There	is	no	way	of	opposing	it,	for	it	is	all-powerful.	But
knowing	the	law	of	its	cyclic	increases	and	decreases,	working	in	harmony	with
its	 tides,	 man	 may	 utilize	 Life.	 He	 may	 produce	 instrumentalities,	 magical
formations	which	attract	this	life-power,	and	by	means	of	which	nature	may	be
made	fruitful.	Such	magical	formations	become	“sacred.”	They	concentrate	the
diffuse	life-energy,	either	to	reinforce	or	to	destroy	the	individual	or	any	product
of	nature.

At	this	stage	of	human	development	astrology	becomes	supremely	important.
It	does	not	deal	any	longer	exclusively	with	celestial	entities	as	separate	beings	to
be	 worshipped	 and	 placated	 —even	 though	 this	 animistic	 attitude	 remains	 still
the	 main	 feature	 of	 the	 exoteric,	 popular	 astrology.	 The	 new	 astrology	 of	 the
vitalistic	period	deals	especially	with	an	understanding	of	the	periodicity	of	life-
processes.	 These,	 experienced	 in	 the	 growth	 and	 decay	 of	 vegetation	 and	 of
natural	entities	in	general,	are	believed	to	be	controlled	by	divine	agencies	which
are	identified	with	Sun,	Moon,	planets—and	to	some	extent	with	stars.

Astrology	 becomes	 a	 study	 of	 the	 universal	 mystery	 of	 periodical	 dynamic
transformations,	which	is	seen	to	be	the	very	essence	of	Life	itself.	The	ancient
Chinese	 symbolized	 this	 law	 of	 natural	 transformation	 in	 their	 series	 of
hexagrams	 constituting	 the	 Yi	 King,	 the	 Book	 of	 Changes.	 This	 is,	 however,
obviously	 a	 later	 and	 more	 abstract	 transmutation	 of	 early	 astrology.	 Vitalistic
astrology	may	have	been	born	in	ancient	Chaldea,	where	it	studied	first	of	all	the
celestial	phenomena	associated	with	the	changes	of	the	seasons.	The	movements
of	the	Sun	and	the	Moon	became	the	basis	of	the	astrological	system.	But	these
movements	are	considered	not	principally	as	celestial	phenomena	in	themselves,
but	 as	 pointers	 to	 the	 dynamic	 changes	 of	 the	 solar	 and	 lunar	 life-force	 as
expressed	 on	 Earth.	 Nomadic	 races,	 depending	 on	 their	 cattle,	 seem	 to	 have
emphasized	the	lunar	periods,	because	these	correspond	more	with	the	periods	of
animal	life,	and	with	sex	and	procreation	through	mating.	Agricultural	races,	on
the	 other	 hand,	 emphasized	 the	 solar	 cycles	 which	 correspond	 to	 the	 cycles	 of
vegetation.	From	these	basic	solar-lunar	correspondences	came	by	generalization
the	great	“Law	of	Analogy,”	which	is	the	very	foundation	of	all	occult	science.

The	 Law	 of	 Analogy	 presupposes	 a	 universal	 agent	 permeating	 the	 entire
universe—a	life-substance	or	life-force	filling	in	all	space;	filling	in	the	dome	of
the	 heavens,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 domus	 (domicile,	 home)	 in	 which	 the	 tribal	 group
lives,	 procreates	 and	 dies	 but	 to	 renew	 and	 continue	 itself	 through	 blood-
propagation.	 The	 tribal	 home	 becomes	 a	 small	 replica	 of	 the	 universal	 home
bound	by	the	spheres	of	the	stars.	The	Earth	is	the	microcosm;	the	universe,	the
macrocosm.	It	is	only	later,	in	Alexandria	and	in	the	Middle	Ages,	that	man,	the
individual	 being,	 is	 considered	 to	 be	 the	 microcosm.	 Then	 astrology	 is
individualized.	 In	 ancient	 Chaldea	 and	 China	 it	 refers	 only	 to	 the	 Earth	 and	 to
the	State	or	community.	The	State	is	the	microcosm,	and	the	Emperor	or	King	its
Sun	and	center	of	life.

In	such	agricultural	states,	built	in	vast	plains,	the	framework	of	all	living	is

produced	by	the	four	great	moments	of	the	cycle	of	solar	changes:	the	equinoxes
and	solstices.	These	are	indissolubly	associated	with	the	four	cardinal	points	of
space.	 Consider	 ancient	 China,	 around	 2000	 B.C.	 The	 capital	 and	 the	 palace	 of
the	 Emperor	 within	 it	 are	 oriented	 to	 these	 four	 points.	 The	 palace	 has	 four
sections,	each	corresponding	to	a	season.	The	Emperor	lives	in	the	East	section
during	 the	 spring,	 in	 the	 South	 section	 during	 the	 summer,	 in	 the	 West	 section
during	the	fall,	and	in	the	North	section	during	the	winter.*

This	 four-fold	 division	 is	 obviously	 associated	 with	 the	 idea	 of	 duality	 and
sex.	 The	 Chinese	 build	 their	 cycle	 of	 change	 upon	 the	 alternate	 waxing	 and
waning	 of	 the	 two	 principles	 Yang	 and	 Yin,	 masculine	 and	 feminine.	 This
dualism	 is	 transferred	 by	 correspondence	 to	 the	 dualism	 of	 day	 and	 night:	 the
Sun,	 lighting	 the	 day;	 the	 Moon,	 lighting	 the	 night.	 The	 female	 animal	 has
periods	 of	 heat	 and	 of	 indifference,	 just	 as	 the	 Moon	 is	 either	 bright	 or	 dark.
Astrology	 is	 thus	 based	 on	 purely	 biological	 concepts.	 It	 is	 dynamic,	 vital.	 It
explains	 the	 causes	 of	 all	 biological	 phenomena	 on	 Earth—later	 of	 all	 social
phenomena,	 as	 in	 Chinese	 civilization,	 in	 which	 social	 organization,	 politics,
music	 and	 all	 culture	 are	 ruled	 by	 the	 pattern	 of	 harmony	 revealed	 by	 the
movements	of	the	celestial	bodies,	themselves	considered	 to	be	the	vehicles	of
symbols	of	the	Divine	Powers	which	collectively	represent	universal	life.

On	 this	 vitalistic	 foundation,	 however,	 a	 more	 mental	 superstructure	 grows
progressively,	as	centuries	roll	by.	Planetary	cycles	are	added	to	those	of	the	Sun
and	 the	 Moon.	 More	 and	 more	 the	 priests	 who	 record,	 tabulate,	 compare	 and
study	the	movements	of	the	celestial	bodies	realize	the	abstract	values	involved
in	 their	 cyclic	 revolutions.	 The	 idea	 of	 “precise	 changeless	 numerical	 ratios”
takes	hold	of	the	mind	of	men	whose	profession	it	is	to	be	symbols	of	order	and
law	 to	 a	 humanity	 still	 gripped	 by	 the	 fear	 of	 elemental	 forces.	 The	 notion	 of
Heavenly	 Order	 becomes	 the	 one	 great	 security	 against	 the	 chaos	 of	 elemental
nature,	 still	 so	 apparent	 in	 storms,	 inundations,	 droughts	 and	 cataclysms	 of	 all
sorts.	An	archetypal,	divine	world	of	Order	is	shown	in	the	Heavens	where	every
object	 moves	 according	 to	 immutable	 laws.	 Man’s	 task	 is	 then	 obviously	 so	 to
operate	upon	the	“earth”	(the	soil	and	cattle,	but	also	his	own	earthly	instinctual
nature)	that	it	becomes	a	perfect	replica	of	the	celestial	Order.

From	such	premises	two	basic	needs	can	be	deduced:	the	need	for	a	calendar
determining	 at	 first	 solely	 the	 time	 when	 all	 agricultural	 operations	 must	 be
performed	 (sowing,	 harvesting,	 etc),	 and	 the	 days	 which	 are	 favorable	 and
unfavorable	to	any	such	operation;	then	the	need	for	an	Ethical	Law	determining

how	man	is	to	deal	with	and	to	cultivate	his	own	nature,	his	own	earthly	being;
how	man	is	to	behave	in	relation	to	man	within	the	framework	of	the	State—if
this	 State	 is	 to	 conform	 to	 the	 celestial	 law.	 Thus,	 in	 ancient	 China	 we	 see	 the
Emperor	as	high-priest	of	this	celestial	religion,	mediator	between	the	Heavenly
Order	centered	around	the	Pole	Star	(where	resides	the	great	God	of	Order)	and
mankind.	 He	 is	 assisted	 by	 four	 astronomers	 who	 together	 with	 him	 determine
the	 agricultural	 Calendar—besides	 establishing	 a	 moral-social	 law	 and	 musical
scales,	music	being	the	agency	whereby	the	earthly	State	may	become	tuned	up
to	the	“Harmony	of	the	Spheres”	(also	a	Pythagorean	idea).	Music	includes	tones
and	ritualistic	dancing	as	well,	for	there	again	the	principle	of	duality	must	reign.
Bodily	 motions	 harmonized	 to	 musical	 tones	 and	 rhythms—such	 a	 harmony
symbolizes	 and	 magically	 calls	 for	 a	 corresponding	 harmony	 between	 human
emotions	and	celestial	motions.

The	 Emperor	 is	 the	 fixed	 point	 of	 reference	 for	 all	 ethical	 social
measurements,	as	the	North	Pole	is	astronomically.	His	voice	is	a	paragon	for	all
tones;	his	body,	for	all	measurements.	All	roads	are	measured	from	the	center	of
his	palace,	where	he	lives;	or	rather,	because	he	cyclically	changes	his	residence,
where	 stands	 the	 tomb	 of	 the	 Great	 Ancestor,	 the	 origin	 of	 the	 State.	 The
Emperor	is	the	One	Man,	the	One	Individual,	the	One	Mediator	through	whom
the	 Order	 of	 the	 Heavens	 is	 infused	 into	 the	 State.	 He	 is	 thus	 the	 Supreme
Astrologer.	 Or	 rather	 he	 is	 the	 very	 Condensation	 of	 all	 Heavenly	 Virtues,	 and
his	 four	 astrologers	 through	 him	 are	 able	 to	 partake	 of	 the	 mystery	 of	 the
Heavens.

This	 represents	 a	 perfected	 stage	 of	 astrological	 civilization;	 but	 —is	 it	 not
astonishingly	like	the	Christian	religion,	on	a	different	plane?	For	is	not	Jesus	the
Christ	the	One	Mediator	between	mankind	and	God,	the	One	Spiritual	Individual
(being	 the	 Only	 Begotten	 Son),	 the	 paragon	 of	 all	 celestial	 virtues,	 the	 only
fountain	 of	 salvation?	 And	 are	 not	 His	 Apostles	 and	 the	 popes	 by	 apostolic
succession	the	dispensers	of	His	wisdom,	the	establishers	of	a	Church	militant,
which	is	to	become	a	replica	on	earth	of	the	Church	triumphant	in	Heaven?

Christianity	came	at	a	time	of	great	psychological	chaos,	when	a	new	world
was	 being	 born	 out	 of	 the	 ruins	 of	 the	 East-Mediterranean	 past,	 when	 Greek
intellectualism	and	individualism	had	led	to	utter	psychological	confusion.	The
Christian	Church	became	then	the	symbol	of	a	Heavenly	Order,	the	only	security
in	 a	 period	 of	 chaos,	 the	 one	 integrating	 force	 in	 a	 welter	 of	 passions	 and
decadent	perversions.	But	so	was	the	astrological	State	of	Chaldea	and	of	China
the	 only	 security	 against	 elemental	 chaos.	 The	 cyclic	 courses	 of	 the	 celestial

bodies	alone	were	tokens	of	a	universal	Order.	The	knowledge	of	the	solar	and
lunar	motions	alone	could	save	man	from	ruined	crops—which	meant	starvation
and	 chaos.	 What	 this	 astrological	 knowledge	 represented	 is	 shown	 by	 the	 fact
that	in	China	the	fall	of	the	first	dynasty	of	Hia	is	said	to	have	been	caused	by
the	failure	of	the	imperial	astrologers	to	announce	an	eclipse.	Whenever,	because
of	 incomplete	 knowledge	 of	 celestial	 motions,	 a	 planet	 did	 not	 appear	 exactly
where	expected,	this	was	taken	to	foretell	chaos	and	ruin	to	the	imperial	house.	If
the	 rulers	 failed	 to	 know	 accurately	 the	 celestial	 happenings,	 the	 only	 bulwark
against	 chaos	 was	 destroyed,	 and	 the	 rulers	 had	 to	 go.	 They	 were	 to	 be	 the
Integrators,	the	Organizers,	the	Custodians	of	the	Universal	Order.	If	they	failed
to	 know	 that	 Order,	 they	 proved	 themselves	 unworthy.	 They	 had	 to	 be
overthrown	for	the	very	salvation	of	the	people.*

On	the	biological	plane	of	agricultural	operations,	and	on	the	plane	of	ethical
and	social	organizations,	astrology	was,	then,	the	Great	Knowledge	which	alone
insured	 security	 and	 that	 spiritual	 trust	 in	 a	 Cosmic	 Law	 without	 which	 no
civilization	is	possible.	It	was	vital,	living	knowledge,	for	at	every	step	it	filtered
into	 the	 operations	 of	 all	 life-processes!	 It	 was	 the	 Science	 of	 life,	 or,	 as	 M.
Berthelot	 says,	 Astrobiology—the	 science	 of	 a	 life	 conceived	 as	 archetypally
ordered	 and	 cosmic,	 operating	 identically	 in	 the	 microcosm,	 Earth,	 as	 in	 the
macrocosm,	the	universe.

The	Change	of	the	Sixth	Century	B.C.

Then	man	began	to	develop	a	new	basis	for	living	and	to	know	himself	as	an
individual,	 a	 free	 being;	 and	 a	 new	 jungle	 arose	 at	 a	 higher	 level,	 the	 psycho-
mental	level.	This	meant	the	start	of	a	new	cycle	of	human	development,	calling
for	a	New	Astrology,	a	new	understanding	of	Order,	of	Cosmos,	of	God.

This	 momentous	 change	 occurred,	 archetypally	 as	 it	 were,	 during	 the	 sixth
century	 B.C.;	 the	 time	 of	 Gautama	 the	 Buddha,	 followed	 by	 Lao-Tze	 and
Confucius,	 the	 last	 Zoroaster	 and	 Gushapt,	 Pythagoras	 and,	 later,	 Plato—to
mention	 only	 the	 most	 outstanding	 spiritual	 figures	 of	 this	 critical	 time	 which
marked	a	potential	reversal	of	all	human	values.	Twenty-five	hundred	years	later
humanity	is	trying	to	bring	into	actual	and	organic	manifestation	what	was	then	a
mere	potentiality.

The	 main	 significance	 of	 the	 change,	 as	 far	 as	 this	 present	 study	 of	 ours	 is
concerned,	 is	 that	 the	 emphasis	 which	 had	 so	 far	 been	 exclusively	 placed	 on
to	 psychological	 values.

### to	 be

Everything	before	600	B.C.	was	based	upon	the	human	“body.”	Since	then,	more
and	more,	a	new	foundation	has	been	raised,	and	almost	everything	is	sooner	or
later	 to	 be	 focussed	 upon	 the	 human	 “psyche”—using	 this	 term	 to	 represent
man’s	 inner	 nature:	 mind,	 soul,	 and	 their	 various	 activities	 and	 functions,
conscious	and	unconscious.

Everything	 was,	 of	 old,	 centered	 upon	 the	 body—including	 all	 spirituality.
For	the	body	was	not	then	what	it	is	to	us	Christians.	It	was	the	pure	vehicle	of
instincts	 and	 of	 the	 spirit,	 but	 only	 potentially	the	 vehicle	 of	 spirit.	 Spirit	 was
asleep	in	the	body	and	had	to	be	aroused,	made	active—this	being	the	basis	of
the	pure	archaic	form	of	Hatha	Yoga	before	the	sixth	century,	 B.C.	This	arousal
could	 be	 induced	 by	 control	 of	 the	 life-force,	 through	 breathing,	 sounds	 and
ritualistic	 postures	 or	 movements—but	 also	 in	 relation	 to	 cosmic	 processes
involving	 Sun,	 Moon,	 planets,	 and	 stars.	 In	 the	 Kundalini	 Yoga,	 man	 is
understood	as	a	system	of	vital	centers	or	whirls	of	energy	which	correspond	to
these	celestial	dynamos,	the	planets,	and	Sun	and	Moon.	Finally	the	life-force	is
completely	 transfigured	 by	 its	 marriage	 with	 Spirit	 and	 the	 thousand-petalled
lotus	blooms,	the	Sahasrara	chakra;	that	is,	the	solar	system	is	transcended	and
the	myriads	of	stars	shine,	chrysanthemum	of	the	Heavens,	the	Cosmic	Rose—
while	is	heard	the	mystery	sound,	Nada	in	Sahasrara,	the	Voice	of	the	God	that
dwells	within	the	Pole	Star.

In	other	words,	what	the	Chinese	State	as	a	whole	was	to	be,	the	Yogi	sought
to	fulfill	in	himself,	as	an	Individual.	To	the	Chinese	Emperor	corresponded	the
“Ishvara-in-the-body,”	the	“Jewel	in	the	Lotus”	of	Thibetan	lore.	Astrology	here
meant	 practical	 spiritual	 development—but	 spiritual	 development	 through	 the
body,	 through	 the	 human	 earth	 made	 perfect	 and	 cosmic	 in	 the	 likeness	 of	 the
celestial	harmony.

It	seems	to	us	a	mistake	to	believe	that	the	old	Kundalini	Yoga	 and	similar
methods	 of	 development	 referred	 to	 psychological	 facts	 —as	 C.	 G.	 Jung
apparently	 believes.	 If	 it	 did,	 it	 was	 only	 after	 the	 reforms	 of	 the	 Buddha.	 For
then	the	chaos	of	the	world	was	shown	not	to	be	overcomeable	through	means
which	 were	 almost	 entirely	 psychological	 and	 rational,	 or	 suprarational.	 And	 a
new	type	of	astrology	soon	began	to	develop:	alchemical	astrology.

Alchemy,	 when	 not	 perverted	 or	 materialized,	 is	 an	 attempt	 to	 do	 with	 the
human	psyche	what	the	Chinese	Emperor	was	supposed	to	do	as	supreme	Ruler
of	 Agriculture	 and	 Establisher	 of	 the	 Calendar.	 Its	 purpose	 is	 to	 raise
psychological	 crops	 and	 to	 domesticate	 the	 wild	 herd	 of	 human	 desires.	 The

Yoga	of	Patanjali	and	the	mental	training	of	the	Buddha	dealt	more	specifically
with	 the	 mental	 processes.	 “Yoga	 is	 the	 hindering	 of	 the	 modifications	 of	 the
mind,”	 wrote	 Patanjali.	 But	 Chinese	 alchemy,	 along	 the	 lines	 pursued	 by	 the
Taoists,	and	European	alchemy,	from	Geber	to	Boehme	via	Paracelsus,	are	more
particularly	dealing	with	the	energy-aspect	of	the	psyche,	or	we	might	say,	with
the	 soulnature	 of	 man—its	 purification,	 redemption	 and	 fructifying	 by	 the
“virtue”	of	Christ,	or	in	another	sense,	of	Tao.

In	alchemy	the	human	“earth”	to	be	tilled	and	transmuted	until	it	bears	forth
the	immaculately-born	“Son	of	God,”	the	Christ-body,	is	symbolized	by	metals
and	by	planets.	The	processes	of	transmutation	are	symbolized	by	“codes”	which
are	either	series	of	symbols	drawn	from	natural	agricultural	processes,	in	China;
or	interpretation	of	incidents	of	the	life	of	Jesus	as	recorded	in	the	Gospels,	in
European	 alchemy	 (especially	 with	 Boehme).	 The	 Book	 of	 the	 Golden	 Flower
translated	from	the	Chinese	by	Richard	Wilhelm,	as	well	as	the	archaic	Yi	King,
will	 show	 what	 the	 former	 are.	 The	 latter	 can	 be	 studied	 in	 Boehme’s	 writings
and	those	of	older	alchemists.

The	use	made	of	astrology	in	alchemy	is	largely	symbolical.	But	in	a	sense
astrology	 is	 always	 symbolical	 when	 properly	 understood.	 All	 depends	 upon
what	is	meant	by	“symbol.”	Algebra	is	also	purely	symbolical,	and	yet	algebra
and	 higher	 mathematics	 have	 made	 possible	 modern	 science	 and	 the	 age	 of
machines.	Astrology	is	fundamentally	the	algebra	of	life.	But	its	applications	are
as	numerous	as	the	types	of	life	it	co-ordinates,	integrates,	and	to	which	it	gives
the	significance	of	Order.

The	old	Chaldean	astrology	was	based	on	the	principles	of	correspondences
—purely	 symbolical	 principles.	 True,	 the	 Chaldeans	 did	 believe	 that	 planets
were	the	bodies	of	gods	according	to	whose	dictates	the	universe	was	run.	But
this	was	merely	an	interpretation	of	astrological	symbolism.	The	symbols	were
interpreted	 as	 gods	 because	 man’s	 consciousness	 was	 essentially	 physiological
and	biological,	because	his	objective	and	subjective	worlds	were	still	very	much
confused,	 and	 there	 was	 no	 clear-cut	 division	 between	 what	 was	 physiological
and	 what	 was	 psycho-mental;	 because	 animism	 had	 still	 very	 strong	 roots	 in
man’s	consciousness.

As	 mind	 developed	 independently,	 especially	 after	 the	 sixth	 century	 B.C,	as
abstract	thinking	began	to	separate	thought	from	its	concrete	life-foundation,	the
biological	 valuation	 of	 “practical	 utility”	 receded	 into	 the	 background,	 and	 the
interpretation	of	“pure	knowledge,”	“pure	science,”	was	given	to	astrology.	Then

it	became	astronomy.	This,	as	M.	Berthelot	points	out,	occurred	preeminently	in
Chaldea;	 while	 in	 Egypt	 the	 transformation	 was	 more	 characteristically	 from
ceremonial	 magic	 to	 spiritual	 ethics.	 In	 China,	 the	 old	 agrarian	 interpretation
gave	place	to	a	social-ethical	one.	In	India,	what	used	to	refer	to	the	body	and	to
the	life-force	within	the	body	(escape	from	the	jungle-world	of	men’s	senses	by
a	process	of	detachment	and	unification	of	energies),	came	to	be	applied	to	the
mind.	 In	 Greece,	 the	 old	 Orphic	 religion	 also	 became	 transmuted	 into
Pythagoreanism.

In	 every	 case	 what	 occurred	 was	 a	 change	 of	 level,	 a	 change	 of
interpretation.	The	personal	God	became	(theoretically	and	potentially	only!)	an
impersonal	 Law	 or	 Principle	 of	 Order;	 just	 as	 in	 original	 American	 democracy
we	 see	 the	 idea	 of	 personal	 Kingship	 give	 place	 to	 that	 of	 an	 inviolable
Constitution.	 “In	 America	 the	 Law	 is	 King,”	 said	 Thomas	 Paine.	 At	 the	 same
time	 and	 for	 the	 same	 reasons	 the	 principle	 of	 blood-relationship,	 which
represented	 the	 only	 bond	 valid	 to	 a	 humanity	 focussed	 at	 the	 physiological
level,	began	to	be	challenged	by	a	new	type	of	human	relationship,	the	spiritual
brotherhood	including	men	(and	at	times	women)	of	different	bloods	and	races.
Witness	 the	 Buddhistic	 Sangha,	 the	 Pythagorean	 sodalities,	 the	 Gnostic
brotherhoods	 (whence
the	 Catholic	 monastic	 orders),	 and	 finally	 such
brotherhoods	as	those	of	the	Druzes	in	Mount	Lebanon	(originally	composed	of
mystics	of	all	races).

Unfortunately,	yet	most	naturally,	such	a	tremendous	change	 of	level	could
not	possibly	be	operative	among	the	masses.	The	tragic	thing	was	that	even	the
elite	of	mankind	failed	to	live	up	to	the	potentiality	of	the	vision	opened	up	to	it
by	 the	 Great	 Teachers	 of	 the	 sixth	 century	 B.C.;	and	 the	 five	 or	 more	 centuries
which	followed	are	the	story	of	the	relative	failure	of	mankind	to	adjust	itself	to
a	new	level	of	being.	Whether	in	China,	or	India,	or	Greece,	or	Persia,	the	result
was	the	same,	the	depth	reached	varying,	of	course,	with	each	civilization.

In	Greece,	mind	turned	into	mere	analytical	intellect,	wisdom	into	sophistry.
Individualism	 developed	 in	 an	 unbalanced	 manner,	 and	 humanity	 entered	 a
phase	of	large-scale	psychological	chaos,	with	the	usual	result	of	physiological
disequilibrium,	 sensuality,	 perversion,	 etc.	 This	 led,	 by	 reaction,	 to	 popular
Christianity,	and	in	India	to	the	Bhakti	movement	and	Mahayana	 Buddhism.	A
wholesale	psychological	revulsion	against	mind	set	in,	and	religions	of	feelings
and	love,	devotional	and	compassionate,	swept	over	the	world.

In	 the	 meantime	 astrology	 had	 experienced	 a	 deep	 transformation.	 It	 had

ceased	 to	 be	 vital	 and	 necessary	 to	 the	 collectivities	 as	 a	 principle	 of	 order,
because	 the	 growing	 domination	 of	 the	 intellectual	 rational	 principle	 enabled
man	to	project	speculatively	his	own	order	into	the	world.	But—and	this	is	the
important	point—the	rational	order	of	the	intellect	is	of	a	different	quality	than
the	biological	order.	The	intellect	is	but	an	instrumentality	which	helps	man	to
raise	 his	 consciousness	 from	 the	 physiological	 to	 the	 psycho-mental	 level.	 It
cannot	 fill	 a	 human	 life	 with	 vital	 significance.	 It	 creates	 a	 separative	 kind	 of
individualism,	based	on	analysis	but	not	on	synthesis—and	all	life	is	synthesis.
As	 individuals	 became	 more	 and	 more	 the	 important	 thing,	 astrology	 began	 to
cater	to	them	and	to	their	fears.	Then	its	long	cycle	of	outer	degeneration	began.
It	 became	 increasingly,	 on	 the	 surface,	 mere	 fortune-telling—while	 the	 deeper
phases	of	astrology	found	themselves	reborn,	as	already	stated,	as	the	foundation
for	alchemy.

The	 turning-point	 came	 probably	 as	 astrological	 ideas	 swept	 from	 Chaldea
westward;	 first	 “through	 the	 Babylonian	 sage	 Berosus	 who	 founded	 a	 school
about	640	B.C.	in	the	Island	of	Cos	and	perhaps	counted	Thales	of	Miletus	(639-
548)	 among	 his	 pupils.”
(Cf.	 Encyclopaedia	 Britannica	 “History	 of
Astronomy”);	and,	even	more	definitely,	during	the	middle	of	the	fourth	century
B.C.	(according	to	Bouché-Leclercq	and	others).	While	in	Chaldea,	as	in	China,
astrology	was	mainly	a	matter	concerning	the	community	or	the	state,	with	the
King	as	center	and	guiding	principle	of	the	state,	in	Greece,	and	later,	in	Rome,
the	practice	of	making	individual	horoscopes	developed.	Astrology	fell	soon	into
the	 hands	 of	 commercially-minded	 people,	 who	 came	 rapidly	 to	 be	 known	 as
charlatans.	 In	 Rome,	 these	 were	 called	 first	 “Mathematici,”	 then	 “Chaldeans,”
and,	just	as	in	modern	times,	so	much	trickery	or	foolishness	became	connected
with	 their	 practice	 that	 they	 were	 at	 times	 forced	 by	 imperial	 edicts	 to
discontinue	their	trade.

In	 ancient	 India	 an	 official	 astrologer	 was	 attached	 to	 every	 village-
community,	and	it	appears	that	one	of	his	functions	was	to	cast	the	horoscope	of
the	new-born	children	of	the	high	castes.	But	in	this	case	the	practice	had	a	very
ritualistic	and	physiological	or	biological	significance;	for	marriages	were	often
made	 by	 comparing	 birth-charts,	 and	 even	 the	 connubial	 life	 was	 regulated	 by
the	stars.	In	other	words,	here	again	we	find	a	biological	type	of	individualism	in
operation.	 The	 bodies	 of	 the	 individuals	 (of	 the	 high	 castes)	 had	 to	 be
“cultivated,”	or	in	fact	bred,	so	that	they	might	become	perfect	instruments	for
the	release	of	the	spirit.	Racial	purity	was	another	expression	of	the	same	ideal;
and	 it	 was	 forced	 by	 circumstances,	 for	 Aryan	 blood	 had	 to	 be	 carefully

preserved,	or	else	the	overwhelming	mass	of	non-Aryan	people	in	India	would
have	corrupted	the	race	type.	This	would	have	meant	physiological	chaos.	Thus
here	again	astrology	served	as	a	means	to	bring—or	to	keep—biological	order;
as	 a	 defense	 against	 elemental	 nature	 and	 as	 a	 technique	 of	 developing	 the
“domesticated”	nature,	i.e.,	nature	true	to	the	celestial	pattern	represented	by	the
Manu,	the	great	divine	Ancestor.	Such	a	biological	problem	arises	always	when
a	more	or	less	nomadic	race	living	on	the	highlands	invades	the	plains	teeming
with	a	decadent	humanity.

There	are,	however,	no	evidences	that	the	individualization	of	astrology	and
its	 use	 for	 personal	 purposes	 in	 Greece	 and	 Rome	 had	 a	 similar	 physiological
basis.	There	may	have	been	an	archaic	type	of	Greek	astrology	connected	with
the	Orphic	mysteries,	as	there	was	an	archaic	Egyptian	astrology	connected	with
ceremonial	magic;	but	to	our	knowledge	no	traces	of	it	have	been	preserved.	It	is
evident,	however,	that	Pythagoras	used	astrology	in	relation	to	music—and	there
perhaps	 we	 should	 have	 to	 look	 for	 the	 origin	 of	 the	 ethical-psychological-
alchemical	astrology	of	later	times.

Such	a	type	of	astrology—which	must	be	sharply	differentiated	from	the	type
to	 which	 Ptolemy	 refers—is	 an	 attempt	 at	 bringing	 some	 sort	 of	 psychological
order	 into	 the	 inner	 natures	 of	 men	 who	 had	 been	 unbalanced	 by	 the	 new
emphasis	which	Greek	civilization	(and	similar	manifestations	in	the	Orient)	had
placed	 upon	 the	 intellect.	 It	 is	 true	 that	 classical	 Greece	 had	 also	 stressed	 the
elements	of	physical	beauty	and	bodily	form.	But	the	Greek	cult	of	the	body	was
esthetical—not	biological,	or	“occult”	in	the	sense	of	the	early	Hindu	yoga.	The
Greeks	worshipped	form	and	proportion,	not	the	organic	life	that	made	and	that
sings	within	the	body-earth.	They	were	ideologists,	and	finally	estheticians.

It	was	the	impact	of	this	previously	unknown	ideologism,	which	deals	with
order,	form,	measure	as	abstractions	valid	on	their	own	mental	plane	without	the
necessity	for	a	physiological	foundation	or	even	context,	that	shook	the	human
world—and	destroyed	the	vital	meaning	of	astrology.	Astrology	had	discovered
the	order	that	is	within	the	sphere	of	biological	phenomena.	It	was	the	promise
inherent	 in	 nature—outer	 or	 inner—that	 the	 apparent	 chaos	 of	 natural	 energies
can	be	resolved	into	a	cosmos;	that	therefore	prevision	based	on	law	is	possible;
that	 the	 living	 future	 can	 be	 deduced	 from	 the	 living	 past.	 Now	 men	 were
beginning	to	deal	with	an	abstract	order;	no	longer	with	cosmos	within	nature-
living	cosmos—but	with	ideological	patterns,	with	logic.

Greek	 logic	 killed	 the	 meaning	 of	 physiological	 astrology.	 If	 man	 could

make	 his	 own	 order	 abstractly,	 and	 satisfy	 in	 that	 way	 his	 innate	 yearning	 for
security,	 there	 was	 no	 longer	 vital	 value	 in	 trying	 to	 search	 painfully	 for	 order
within	outer	nature.	Man	could	command	order.	He	could	project	it	outwardly—
which	 means	 estheticism—out	 of	 his	 own	 self,	 his	 own	 mental	 self.	 He	 could
make	 the	 world	 again	 out	 of	 ideas.	 What	 an	 incredible	 revolution!	 Before	 that
time,	ideas	were	merely	connective	links	between	natural	phenomena	concretely
perceived.	 Now	 they	 were	 said	 to	 live	 in	 their	 own	 world,	 a	 world	 where	 man
also	could	dwell	far	away	from	the	realm	of	natural	chaos	and	of	biological	fear.
Such	 a	 conception	 transformed	 the	 entire	 human	 outlook	 in	 a	 way	 which	 it	 is
very	difficult	for	us	moderns	to	appreciate,	especially	as	most	of	what	we	have
known	 of	 the	 archaic	 ages	 was	 more	 or	 less	 rewritten,	 or	 for	 the	 first	 time
recorded,	after	the	sixth	century	B.C.

If	order	was	existing	in	an	archetypal	world	outside	the	 world	of	biological
nature,	then	the	thing	to	do	was,	of	course,	to	leave	the	latter	and	its	fears—and
to	enter	the	blessed	realm.	The	Buddhists	attempted	to	do	that	by	meditation,	by
severance	from	physiological	life,	and	by	a	thorough	mentalization	of	the	body.
This	was	quite	different	from	the	“archaic”	yoga	which	was	an	attempt	to	rouse
the	vital	spirit	in	the	body,	to	free	it	from	sense-bondage	and	“jungle”	fever,	and
integrate	 it	 to	 a	 point	 of	 perfect	 unity	 with	 the	 “God	 that	 dwells	 in	 the	 Pole
Star”—as	 the	 Chinese	 had	 it.	 The	 Greeks	 looked	 for	 an	 escape	 from	 the	 tragic
world	 of	 nature	 and	 its	 passional	 fate	 by	 pure	 thought,	 pure	 esthetical
contemplation	and	“platonic”	love.

Finally,	when	these	types	of	escapes	ended	in	ratiocination	and	sophistry,	or
in	 the	 absolute	 selfishness	 of	 a	 fallacious	 nirvana,	 then	 a	 strong	 psychological
reaction	 set	 in,	 and	 religions	 of	 feelings	 arose:	 the	 Boddhisattva	 ideal	 of
compassion,	or	in	India	and	Persia	the	bhakti	ideal	of	a	love—so	personal	in	its
ecstasy	 as	 to	 be	 expressed	 in	 symbols	 taken	 from	 the	 most	 sensual	 passion;	 or
the	Christian	ideal	of	charity,	sacrifice	and	martyrdom.	These	religions	had	also
a	 world	 freed	 from	 the	 sufferings	 and	 fears	 (now	 become	 “sins”)	 of	 earthly
nature;	 but	 this	 world	 could	 only	 be	 attained	 after	 death.	 It	 was	 the	 “other
world;”	and	its	entrance	was	guarded	by	the	Church,	without	recourse	to	which
man	was	confronted	with	a	still	more	horrible	realm	of	fear	and	chaos—hell.	It	is
true	 that	 archaic	 religions	 did	 often	 imagine	 a	 world	 of	 gods	 to	 which	 mortals
might	 be	 admitted	 after	 death,	 but	 the	 significance	 of	 this	 world	 was	 entirely
different	psychologically	from	that	of	the	Christian	“other	world.”	For	the	latter
gave	 a	 pejorative	 and	 sinful	 meaning	 to	 anything	 connected	 with	 physio-
biological	nature,	which	is	the	important	point.	Then	faith,	blind	obedience,	love,

became	exalted;	exalted	against	natural	biological	living.	Thus	the	long	story	of
repressions	began,	the	divorcing	of	the	spirit	from	the	flesh.	Men	lost	the	solid
order	of	natural	instincts	and	were	unable	as	yet	to	reach	another	solidity,	that	of
a	 higher	 order	 of	 life	 at	 the	 psycho-mental	 level.	 They	 therefore	 found
themselves	dwelling	in	an	intermediate	realm,	a	realm	peopled	by	the	results	of
sophism—a
suppressions,	 denials,
psychological	jungle	indeed.

### feelings	 and

### thwarted

In	this	jungle,	as	in	any	jungle,	there	was	fear.	Monstrous	creatures,	incubi,
succubi,	evil	forces	crowded	it;	no	longer	physiological	creatures	connected	with
earthy	 elements,	 but	 products	 of	 sins,	 of	 self-deceptions	 and	 of	 biological
starvation.	 From	 this	 arose	 a	 psychological	 type	 of	 animism.	It	 is	 true	 that	 the
Church	 offered	 order	 and	 security	 to	 those	 who	 entered	 her	 realm.	 But	 how
many	monasteries	did	really	keep	the	jungle	out?

Yet	the	Church	was	a	refuge,	a	token	of	the	possibility	of	a	supernal	world	to
which	she	alone	led.	And	therefore	the	Church	took	the	place	of	astrology.	It	did
so	with	many	festivals	and	ceremonies	arranged	with	great	order	throughout	the
year—in	 fact	 duplicating	 the	 old	 biological	 festivals	 based	 on	 the	 astrology	 of
the	 archaic	 era.	 It	 did	 so	 for	 its	 consecrated	 children	 with	 a	 daily	 series	 of
masses,	 prayers,	 services,	 extending	 through	 night	 and	 day.	 All	 these	 church
ceremonies	 represented	 the	 Christian	 year,	 the	 Christian	 zodiac	 (now	 inhabited
by	 saints	 and	 archangels),	 the	 Christian	 cosmic	 order.	 Observance	 of	 those
ceremonies	kept	the	jungle	away	from	the	soul.

But	it	was	still	astrology	under	a	different	garb!	Astrology	without	the	name.
The	 wheel	 of	 the	 zodiac	 was	 replaced	 by	 a	 system	 of	 permutations	 of	 the	 four
elements:	 hot,	 cold,	 dry,	 humid—not	 unlike	 the	 Chinese	 Yi	 King.	 To	 those
permutations	 corresponded	 the	 many	 festivals	 of	 the	 year,	 some	 liturgy
appropriate	 for	 those,	 and	 to	 them	 were	 attached,	 as	 symbolical	 illustrations,
episodes	 of	 the	 Gospels.*	 Boehme	 was	 to	 extend	 the	 same	 system,	 using
alchemy	as	a	foundation—not	unlike	that	of	the	Chinese	Taoists.

### Kabbalistic	Astrology

There	came,	however,	during	the	Middle	Ages	(especially	after	the	eleventh
century)	 a	 great	 renewal	 of	 astrological	 ideas	 proper,	 which,	 while	 repudiated
and	combated	by	the	Church,	still	came	more	and	more	to	control	the	minds	of
the	period.	This	astrology	was	the	result	of	the	“psychological	animism”	already
mentioned;	and	it	can	be	generally	characterized	by	the	term	Kabbalistic.	It	was

linked	 very	 definitely	 to	 various	 forms	 of	 ceremonial	 magic,	 and	 came	 to
Europe,	 mostly,	 it	 seems,	 through	 Spain	 and	 from	 centers	 of	 Arabic	 culture,
especially	perhaps,	Fez,	in	Morocco.

The	 origin	 of	 this	 trend	 of	 astrology,	 essentially	 magical,	 appears	 to	 have
been	 a	 mixture	 of	 Egyptian	 and	 Hebrew	 traditions.	 The	 books	 of	 Hermes
Trismegistus,	compendium	of	Egyptian	gnosticism,	were	partly	a	foundation	for
it—and	presumably	a	great	number	of	oral	traditions	possibly	descending	from
the	 old	 Mysteries,	 Babylonian	 and	 Greek.	 At	 any	 rate,	 we	 find	 there	 a	 rather
curious	 mixture	 of	 elements,	 many	 of	 which	 are	 not	 altogether	 fortunate.	 That
which	once	had	been	a	vital	function	in	archaic	society	appeared	after	the	great
psychological	 transformation	 of	 humanity	 as	 an	 inferior	 function	 (to	 use	 the
terminology	 of	 Jung’s	 psychology).	 It	 was	 the	 old	 magical	 idea	 of	 animism
translated	 to	 the	 chaotic	 “astral”	 realm	 in	 which	 the	 collective	 psyche	 of	 the
Middle	Ages	was	so	definitely	centered.	Thus	the	element	of	fear	was	strongly
present.	 The	 magician	 uses	a	sword	to	 combat	 the	evil	spirits,	protects	 himself
by	magical	circles.	Yet	fear	is	often	in	his	heart,	and	the	door	is	thus	opened	to
psychological	disintegration.	Witness	the	horrors	of	ceremonial	magic	in	Europe,
even	to	this	day.

Such	 types	 of	 magic,	 pure	 or	 impure	 as	 might	 be	 the	 case,	 used	 astrology
consistently.	 According	 to	 Kabbalistic	 ideas,	 the	 Universe	 consisted	 of	 ten
concentric	 spheres,	 each	 sphere	 being	 under	 the	 influence	 of	 one	 of	 the	 ten
Sephiroth,	or	Emanations	from	the	Absolute.	These	spheres	were	in	order:

Each	of	the	planetary	spheres	 presided	 over	 a	 certain	section	 of	human	affairs,
and	 the	 man	 who	 wished	 to	 succeed	 in	 these	 affairs	 had	 to	 know	 the	 mystic
symbols	 of	 the	 governing	 planet	 and	 the	 names	 and	 attributes	 of	 the	 operating
genii.	(Cf.	 E.	 Y.	 Pilcher—Two	Kabbalistic	Planetary	 Charms—Soc.	 of	Biblical
Archaeology	—1906.)	Magic	squares	were	also	used,	and	talismans	were	made
to	secure	the	offices	of	the	spirits	or	the	influence	of	the	planetary	spheres.

### What	 these	 genii	 were	 supposed	 to	 be	 can	 be	 seen	 from	 the	 following

### excerpt:

“The	 Creation	 of	 Life	 by	 the	 Sun	 is	 as	 continuous	 as	 his	 light;	 nothing
arrests	or	limits	it.	Around	him,	like	an	army	of	Satellites,	are	innumerable
choirs	 of	 genii.	 These	 dwell	 in	 the	 neighborhood	 of	 the	 Immortals,	 and
thence	watch	over	human	things.	They	fulfill	the	will	of	the	gods	by	means
of	 storms,	tempests,	 transitions	of	 fire	and	earthquakes,	likewise	 by	 famine
and	 wars	 for	 the	 punishment	 of	 impiety.	 .	 .	 .	 Under	 the	 Sun’s	 orders	 is	 the
choir	of	Genii,	or	rather	the	choirs,	for	there	are	many	and	diverse,	and	their
number	corresponds	to	that	of	the	stars.	Every	star	has	its	genii,	good	or	evil

by	 nature,	 or	 rather	 by	 their	 operation,	 for	 operation	 is	 the	 essence	 of	 the
genii.	 ...	 All	 these	 genii	 preside	 over	 mundane	 affairs,	 they	 shake	 and
overthrow	 the	 constitution	 of	 States	 and	 of	 individuals;	 they	 imprint	 their
likeness	on	our	Souls,	they	are	present	in	our	nerves,	our	marrow,	our	veins,
our	arteries,	and	our	very	brain-substance.	.	.	.	They	change	perpetually,	not
always	identically,	but	revolving	in	circles.	They	permeate	by	the	body	two
parts	 of	 the	 Soul,	 that	 it	 may	 receive	 from	 each	 the	 impress	 of	 his	 own
energy.	 But	 the	 reasonable	 part	 of	 the	 Soul	 is	 not	 subject	 to	 the	 genii.	 It	 is
designed	for	the	reception	of	God,	who	enlightens	it	with	a	sunny	ray.	Those
who	are	thus	illumined	are	few	in	number,	and	from	them	the	genii	abstain;
for	neither	genii	nor	gods	have	any	power	in	the	presence	of	a	single	ray	of
God.	But	all	other	men,	both	soul	and	body,	are	directed	by	genii,	to	whom
they	cleave	and	whose	operations	they	affect.”

From	Hermes	Trismegistus	(quoted	in
The	Secret	Doctrine,	I,	p.	294)

Here	we	have	a	typical	attitude,	probably	of	Brahmanical	lineage,	according	to
which	 nature	 is	 conceived	 from	 the	 animistic	 point	 of	 view,	 as	 something	 evil,
something	from	which	(because	of	its	changeful,	unsteady,	monstrously	prolific
and	 unmoral	 quality)	 man	 must	 escape.	 There	 is	 a	 part	 of	 man’s	 soul	 through
which	 man	 can	 contact	 That	 Which	 is	 changeless,	 attributeless,	 limitless—the
Self.	As	the	contact	is	permanently	established,	man	reaches	safety.	The	jungle
becomes	 harmless.	 The	 genii,	 good	 or	 bad,	 can	 no	 longer	 seduce,	 delude	 or
attack	man.	He	is	an	Illumined	One,

The	Kabbalist,	on	the	other	hand,	ordinarily	pursued	another	tactic.	His	task
was	 to	 master	 these	 “astral”	 forces.	 He	 was	 the	 magician	 of	 the	 jungle.	 By
propitiation	(through	physiological	or	psychological	sacrifices)	or	by	command
(using	 a	 knowledge	 of	 the	 Names	 and	 Signatures	 of	 the	 genii)	 he	 made	 nature
subservient	 to	 his	 will.	 This,	 of	 course,	 is	 just	 what	 the	 modern	 engineer	 does.
The	 latter	 may	 have	 nothing	 but	 contempt	 for	 the	 magician	 —but	 the	 fact
remains	 that	 the	 two	 basic	 attitudes	 are	 the	 same;	 for	 the	 formulas	 of	 the
chemists	are	the	signatures	of	the	elements—except	that	they	are	arrived	at	by	a
process	of	intellectual	analysis,	while	the	Kabbalist’s	hieroglyphs	are	the	result
of	a	process	of	psychological	identification.	But	what	is	still	more	important,	the
results	attained	by	the	controllers	of	nature’s	forces	are	in	the	end	often	similar.
The	 magician	 commanded	 genii,	 but	 soon	 became	 their	 slave.	 He	 had	 to	 feed
them	with	his	own	soul.	His	creatures	devoured	him.	And	today	this	society	of

ours,	made	up	of	actual	or	potential	engineers,	has	become	obviously	the	slave
of	 its	 machines,	 of	 all	 the	 instrumentalities	 and	 agencies	 by	 means	 of	 which	 it
commands	the	elements.

Such	an	analogy	will,	of	course,	seem	beside	the	point	and	untenable	to	most
people;	but	if	one	realizes	the	cleavage	which	has	occurred	for	so	many	centuries
between	the	physical	world	ruled	by	the	intellect	and	the	world	of	the	psyche	left
in	 a	 state	 of	 chaos	 reminiscent	 of	 the	 primitive	 jungle,	 in	 spite	 or	 because	 of
moral	 systems	 and	 codes	 of	 behavior—then	 one	 may	 see	 all	 things	 in	 their
proper	relationship.	Modern	science	belongs	to	one	side	of	the	chasm;	and	all	the
so-called	 occult	 or	 esoteric	 systems,	 plus	 modern	 psychoanalysis	 and	 its
derivatives,	to	the	other.

### Alchemical	Astrology

If	Kabbalism	and	the	type	of	astrology	used	in	its	magical	practices	represent
a	 sort	 of	 psychological	 animism,	 the	 true	 kind	 of	 alchemy	 stands	 for	 what	 we
might	 call	 “psychological	 vitalism.”	 Alchemy	 does	 not	 try	 to	 renounce	 nature
and	 to	 center	 consciousness,	 as	 it	 were,	 outside	 of	 it,	 on	 the	 high	 peaks	 of	 the
soul;	nor	does	it	try	to	command	it	by	compulsion	and	the	exercise	of	intellectual
self-will.	It	assumes	a	universal	life-substance	which	fills	in	the	whole	universe,
physical	and	spiritual.	It	sees	man	and	the	universe	as	two	examples	of	the	same
basic	 harmony	 of	 principles	 operating	 in	 and	 through	 this	 life-substance,	 and
aims	at	establishing	man	at	his	own	level	of	manifestation	as	a	perfect	cosmos,
just	as	the	universe	at	its	level	is	a	perfect	cosmos.	Evil	is	due	to	the	fact	that	the
respective	spheres	of	man	and	of	the	universe	become	mixed,	as	man	ceases	to
be	a	mere	part	of	universal	nature	and	becomes	in	his	own	right	a	cosmic	whole.
This	explains	why	in	archaic	times	vitalistic	philosophy	considered	the	earth
as	the	microcosm,	and	in	modern	times	alchemy,	its	counterpart,	considers	man
as	 the	 microcosm.	 Before	 the	 sixth	 century	 B.C.	 man	 was	 not	 actually	 a
microcosm,	 but	 only,	 in	 a	 sense,	 the	 fruition	 of	 the	 earth.	 Even	 so,	 few	 men
really	 are	 microcosms!	 But	 since	 man	 found	 in	 himself,	 independently	 from
nature,	 his	 own	 principle	 of	 Order,	 his	 own	 Measure	 and	 Proportion,	 the	 Idea,
the	God	within—then	man	can	be	said	to	be,	generically	at	least,	the	microcosm.

“To	 understand	 correctly	 the	 meaning	 of	 the	 words	 alchemy	 and
astrology,	 it	 is	 necessary	 to	 understand	 and	 to	 realize	 the	 intimate
relationship	 and	 the	 identity	 of	 the	 Microcosm	 and	 Macrocosm,	 and	 their
mutual	interaction.	All	the	powers	of	the	universe	are	potentially	contained

in	 man	 and	 man’s	 physical	 body,	 and	 all	 his	 organs	 are	 nothing	 else	 but
products	and	representatives	of	the	powers	of	Nature.	...	If	I	have	‘manna’	in
my	constitution,	I	can	attract	‘manna’	from	heaven.	‘Saturn’	is	not	only	in	the
sky,	 but	 also	 deep	 in	 the	 earth	 and	 in	 the	 ocean.	 What	 is	 ‘Venus’	 but	 the
‘Artemisia’	that	grows	in	your	garden?	What	is	‘iron’	but	‘Mars’?	That	is	to
say,	 Venus	 and	 Artemisia	 are	 both	 the	 products	 of	 the	 same	 essence,	 and
Mars	 and	 iron	 are	 both	 the	 manifestations	 of	 the	 same	 cause.	 What	 is	 the
human	body	but	a	constellation	of	the	same	powers	that	formed	the	stars	in
the	sky?	He	who	knows	what	iron	is,	knows	the	attribute	of	Mars.	He	who
knows	Mars,	knows	the	qualities	of	iron.	What	would	become	of	your	heart
if	there	were	no	Sun	in	the	universe?	What	would	be	the	use	of	your	‘vasa
spermatica’	if	there	were	no	Venus?	To	grasp	the	invisible	elements,	to	attract
them	 by	 their	 material	 correspondences,	 to	 control,	 purify,	 and	 transform
them	by	the	living	power	of	the	Spirit—this	is	true	alchemy.”

### Franz	Hartmann,	Paracelsus,	pp.	287-288

The	 following	 quotation	 shows,	 even	 more	 than	 the	 preceding	 one,	 the
difference	between	vitalistic	and	animistic	astrology	(in	the	modern	sense),	for	in
it	Paracelsus	himself,	one	of	the	greatest	figures	in	European	history,	denounces
the	popular	attitude	toward	astrology,	which	was	then	very	much	the	same	as	it	is
today,	and	as	it	had	been	also	in	the	last	period	of	the	Greco-Latin	world:

“No	 one	 needs	 to	 care	 for	 the	 course	 of	 Saturn:	 it	 neither	 shortens	 nor
lengthens	 the	 life	 of	 anybody.	 If	 Mars	 is	 ferocious	 it	 does	 not	 follow	 that
Nero	 was	 his	 child:	 and	 although	 Mars	 and	 Nero	 may	 both	 have	 had	 the
same	qualities	they	did	not	take	them	from	each	other.	It	is	an	old	saying	that
‘a	wise	man	may	rule	the	stars’	and	I	believe	in	that	saying—not	in	the	sense
in	which	you	take	it,	but	in	my	own.	The	stars	force	nothing	into	us	that	we
are	 not	 willing	 to	 take;	 they	 incline	 us	 to	 nothing	 which	 we	 do	 not	 desire.
They	are	free	for	themselves	and	we	are	free	for	ourselves.	You	believe	that
one	man	is	more	successful	in	the	acquirement	of	knowledge,	another	in	the
acquisition	of	power	.	.	.	and	you	think	that	this	is	caused	by	the	stars;	but	I
believe	the	cause	to	be	that	one	man	is	more	apt	than	another	to	acquire	and
to	 hold	 certain	 things,	 and	 that	 this	 aptitude	 comes	 from	 the	 spirit.	 It	 is
absurd	to	believe	that	the	stars	can	make	a	man.	Whatever	the	stars	can	do
we	 can	 do	 ourselves,	 because	 the	 wisdom	 which	 we	 obtain	 from	 God
overpowers	the	heavens	and	rules	over	the	stars.	.	.	.	Man’s	soul	is	made	up
of	the	same	elements	as	the	stars;	but	as	the	wisdom	of	the	Supreme	guides

the	 motions	 of	 the	 stars,	 so	 the	 reason	 of	 man	 rules	 the	 influences	 which
rotate	and	circulate	in	his	soul.

“The	 planetary	 influences	 extend	 through	 all	 Nature,	 and	 man	 attracts
poisonous	qualities	from	the	moon,	from	the	stars	and	from	other	things;	but
the	 moon,	 and	 the	 stars,	 and	 other	 things	 also	 attract	 evil	 influences	 from
man,	and	distribute	them	again	by	their	rays,	because	Nature	is	an	undivided
whole	 whose	 parts	 are	 intimately	 connected.	 .	 .	 .	 The	 sun	 and	 stars	 attract
something	from	us,	and	we	attract	something	from	them,	because	our	astral
bodies	are	in	sympathy	with	the	stars,	and	the	stars	are	in	sympathy	with	our
astral	 bodies;	 but	 the	 same	 is	 the	 case	 with	 the	 astral	 bodies	 of	 all	 other
objects.”

Franz	Hartmann,	Paracelsus,	p.	309,	etc.

This	 expresses	 clearly	 the	 idea	 of	 the	 exact	 correspondence	 between	 the
macrocosm	whose	principle	of	order	is	“God”	and	the	microcosm,	man,	whose
principle	 of	 order	 is	 “reason”—or	 the	 “God	 within	 man.”	 The	 life-substance
circulating	and	differentiated	within	both	macrocosm	and	microcosm	is	one	and
the	 same.	 The	 Light	 is	 the	 same,	 whether	 it	 shines	 as	 Sun	 and	 stars,	 or	 as	 the
radiant	centers	within	man’s	psycho-mental	organism—once	the	latter	is	built	by
a	 long	 process	 of	 psychological	 integration.	 This	 is	 the	 Great	 Work	 of	 the	 true
alchemists,	 the	 process	 of	 “individuation”	 which	 is	 the	 goal	 of	 C.	 G.	 Jung’s
psychological	 work,	 the	 birth	 of	 the	 “Living	 God”	 as	 a	 contemporary	 mystic-
occultist	Bo	Yin	Ra	speaks	of	it,	following	the	tradition	of	Meister	Eckhart	and
Boehme.

In	the	meantime,	of	course,	during	the	centuries	which	led	from	the	Middle
Ages	to	the	Renaissance	and	up	to	the	present	day,	astrology,	as	the	Greco-Latin
world	had	bequeathed	it	to	us	through	Ptolemy,	flourished	in	the	courts,	among
the	 merchants	 eager	 to	 increase	 their	 wealth,	 and	 wherever	 man’s	 insatiable
curiosity	 for	the	 future—as	 an	escape	from	fulfilling	the	 present!—	 held	 sway.
Whenever	 an	 astrologer	 succeeded	 in	 foretelling	 some	 striking	 death,	 birth	 or
calamity,	he	became	famous,	a	favorite	of	kings;	but	when	his	prophecies	failed
in	 some	 notable	 instance	 disgrace	 became	 his	 lot.	 Nostradamus,	 physician	 of
King	Henry	II	of	France	and	a	favorite	of	Catherine	de’	Medici,	William	Lilly,
born	in	1602,	and	his	pupil	John	Gadbury	who	died	in	1691—and	many	others
whose	names	can	be	found	in	various	modern	works	on	astrology,	continue	the
tradition	 of	 Ptolemy,	 adding	 here	 and	 there,	 but	 without	 bringing	 in	 any	 new
element	 of	 importance.	 European	 “classical”	 astrology	 is	 a	 spiritually	 lifeless

rebirth	of	Greco-Latin	intellectualism,	as	is	practically	all	European	classicism.
The	 entire	 progress	 of	 humanity	 is	 then	 concentrated	 upon	 pure	 intellectual
analysis	 and	 physical	 “scientific”	 experimentation.	 The	 vitality	 that	 was	 in
astrology	is	now	centered	in	astronomy.	Man’s	reason	plays	at	recognizing	itself
in	 the	 outer	 world,	 which	 it	 makes	 in	 its	 own	 image,	 just	 as	 pimitive	 man’s
psychic	 sensitiveness	 projected	 itself	 into	 a	 world	 made	 in	 its	 own	 image	 and
peopled	 with	 “spirits”	 and	 deities	 with	 human	 moods.	 Recently	 electricity	 and
radioactivity	 broke	 the	 spell	 and	 led	 man	 to	 the	 startling	 concepts	 of	 twentieth
century	 physics,	 to	 Einstein’s	 theory	 of	 relativity,	 to	 the	 quantum,	 and	 to
Heisenberg’s	principle	of	indeterminacy.	This	means	the	birth	of	a	new	world	of
thought,	widely	open	to	the	Unknown	and	Unknowable,	which	the	last	centuries
had	hoped	to	kill	with	the	magic	sword	of	Reason.	It	is	this	new	world	which	is
now	demanding	an	account	from	astrology.

Astrology	 must	 be	 reborn	 and	 must	 perform	 again	 for	 our	 modern	 world,
made	chaotic	by	an	unbridled	and	false	individualism	and	by	the	sudden	opening
of	psychological	dams,	 the	task	 of	 practical	integration	 which	 has	 always	 been
its	 own.	 Wherever	 the	 correlated	 motions	 of	 Sun,	 Moon,	 planets	 and	 stars	 are
used	to	bring	order	into	the	confusion	of	our	everyday	world—there	is	astrology.
The	 type	 and	 range	 of	 the	 phenomena	 of	 nature	 which	 astrology	 correlates,
interprets	and	makes	significant	in	terms	of	a	cosmic	principle	of	Order,	change
age	after	age.	At	first	they	were	physiological	and	elemental.	Now	they	are	to	be
essentially	 psychological	 and	 mental.	 But	 the	 fundamental	 work	 of	 astrology
remains	the	same.	It	is	to	reveal	the	“Harmony	of	the	Spheres”	at	whatever	level
man’s	consciousness	is	centered.	It	is	to	carry	the	symbol	of	Order	wherever	man
finds	chaos.	In	modern	terminology,	it	is	the	algebra	of	life.

## FIRST	SECTION

## ASTROLOGY	FACES	MODERN	THOUGHT

Can	Astrology	Ever	Become	an	Empirical	Science?
Astrology,	 the	 algebra	 of	 life.	 Such	 a	 statement	 demands	 explanation;	 and	 in
order	 to	 provide	 such	 an	 explanation	 we	 shall	 find	 it	 convenient	 at	 first	 to
examine	briefly	the	views	of	one	of	the	most	representative	of	modern	scientists
in	 reference	 to	 the	 characteristic	 evolution	 of	 scientific	 thought	 throughout	 the
ages.	 These	 views	 are	 particularly	 significant,	 inasmuch	 as	 they	 show	 a
remarkable	 parallelism	 between	 the	 evolution	 of	 natural	 science	 and	 the
evolution	of	astrological	thought	as	outlined	in	the	last	chapter.	On	the	basis	of
such	 a	 parallelism	 it	 will	 be	 easier	 to	 understand	 the	 new	 developments	 of
astrology,	 developments	 which—because	 of	 their	 symbolical	 and	 relational
character—led	us	to	define	astrology-in-the-making:	the	algebra	of	life.

### Writes	Sir	James	Jeans	in	The	New	Background	of	Science:

“Reviewing	the	history	of	man’s	efforts	to	understand	the	workings	of	the
external	world,	we	may	distinguish	three	broad	epochs,	the	nature	of	which
may	 be	 suggested	 by	 the	 words	 animistic,	 mechanical	 and	 mathematical.
(Italic	ours)

“The	 animistic	 period	 was	 characterized	 by	 the	 error	 of	 supposing	 that
the	 course	 of	 nature	 was	 governed	 by	 the	 whims	 and	 passions	 of	 living
beings	 more	 or	 less	 like	 man	 himself.	 Before	 our	 infant	 can	 distinguish
between	 animate	 and	 inanimate	 objects,	 he	 is	 destined	 to	 pass	 through	 a
stage	of	confusing	the	two.	.	.	.	Because	personality	is	the	concept	of	which
he	 has	 most	 immediate	 and	 direct	 experience,	 he	 begins	 by	 personifying
everything.

“As	 the	 history	 of	 the	 individual	 is	 merely	 the	 history	 of	 the	 race	 writ
small,	our	race	did	much	the	same	in	its	infancy	as	its	individuals	still	do	in
theirs.	 .	 .	 .	 Then	 in	 Ionian	 Greece,	 six	 centuries	 before	 Christ,	 the	 human

intelligence	 began	 consciously	 to	 apply	 itself	 to	 the	 study	 of	 nature.	 It	 felt
very	 little	 desire	 to	 increase	 its	 factual	 knowledge	 of	 nature,	 so	 that	 Greek
science	consisted	in	the	main	of	mere	vague	questionings	and	speculations	as
to	why	things	came	to	be	as	they	were	rather	than	otherwise.

“It	was	not	until	the	time	of	Galileo	that	science	turned	from	cosmology
to	 mechanics,	 and	 from	 speculation	 to	 experiment.	 The	 simplest	 way	 of
affecting	 inanimate	 matter	 was	 to	 push	 it	 or	 pull	 it	 by	 means	 of	 muscular
effort.	 So	 long	 as	 men	 could	 only	 experiment	 with	 objects	 which	 were
comparable	 in	 size	 with	 their	 own	 bodies,	 they	 found	 inanimate	 nature
behaving	 as	 though	 its	 constituent	 pieces	 exerted	 pushes	 and	 pulls	 on	 one
another,	 like	 those	 we	 exert	 on	 them	 by	 the	 actions	 of	 our	 muscles.	 In	 this
way	 the	 science	 of	 mechanics	 came	 into	 being.	 Pieces	 of	 matter	 were
supposed	to	exert	‘forces’	on	one	another,	and	these	forces	were	the	causes	of
the	 motions	 of	 the	 bodies	 in	 question,	 or	 rather	 of	 the	 changes	 in	 their
motion.	And	it	was	found	that	the	behavior	of	every	object	was	determined,
entirely	and	completely,	by	the	pushes	and	pulls	to	which	it	was	subjected”
(pp.	33-34)

The	 author	 goes	 on	 to	 discuss	 the	 implications	 of	 this	 mechanistic	 view	 of
nature,	how	it	involves	absolute	determinism,	how	Descartes,	in	order	to	avoid
some	 of	 these	 implications,	 “regarded	 mind	 and	 matter	 as	 entirely	 independent
‘substances,’	 each	 existing	 in	 its	 own	 right	 apart	 from	 the	 other	 and	 of	 such
essentially	 different	 natures	 that	 they	 could	 not	 possibly	 interact.”	 However,	 in
order	to	show	the	intimate	correlation	between	our	thoughts	and	the	atoms	of	our
world,	Descartes	insisted,	as	in	a	different	way	did	Leibnitz	at	a	later	date,	that	at
the	 first	 morning	 of	 creation	 a	 supremely	 benevolent	 God	 had	 miraculously
arranged	 for	 a	 perfect	 and	 continuous	 synchronization	 between	 bodily	 and
mental	events.

### Jeans	goes	on	to	say:

“Throughout	the	mechanical	age	of	science,	scientists	had	proceeded	on
the	 same	general	lines	as	 the	child	and	 the	un-reflective	savage.	Out	of	the
impressions	 registered	 through	 their	 senses,	 they	 had	 built	 an	 inferential
world	 of	 objects	 which	 they	 believed	 to	 be	 real,	 and	 affected	 by	 events	 of
much	the	same	kind	as	occurred	in	everyday	experience.	They	described	this
as	 the	 ‘common-sense’	 view	 of	 science;	 and	 defined	 science	 as	 ‘organized
common-sense.’	 .	 .	 .	 Then	 new	 refinements	 of	 experimental	 technique

brought	 new	 observational	 knowledge,	 which	 showed	 that	 the	 workings	 of
nature	could	not	be	explained	in	terms	of	the	familiar	concepts	of	everyday
life.	.	.	.	Mechanism,	with	its	implications,	has	dropped	out	of	the	scheme	of
science.	 .	 .	 .	 We	 are	 beginning	 to	 see	 that	 man	 had	 freed	 himself	 from	 the
anthropomorphic	 error	 of	 imagining	 that	 the	 workings	 of	 nature	 could	 be
compared	 to	 those	 of	 his	 own	 whims	 and	 caprices	 (animism),	 only	 to	 fall
headlong	into	the	second	anthropomorphic	error	of	imagining	that	they	could
be	compared	to	the	workings	of	his	own	muscles,	and	sinews	(mechanism).

“Whether	 determinism	 has	 also	 been	 banished	 from	 nature	 is	 still	 a
question	for	debate.	.	.	.	But	that	those	particular	causes	which	seemed	until
recently	to	compel	determinism	have	gone—this	is	hardly	open	to	question.”
(pages	41-43)

It	 is	 easy	 to	 see	 how	 the	 three	 stages	 of	 knowledge	 which	 Jeans	 mentions
(animistic,	 mechanical	 and	 mathematical)	 correspond	 to	 the	 three	 stages	 of
astrological	 thought	 discussed	 in	 our	 preceding	 chapter.	 The	 “mechanism”	 of
science	is	not	basically	different	from	the	“vitalism”	of	astrology;	the	“push	and
pull”	 of	 the	 former	 corresponds	 in	 terms	 of	 material	 activity	 to	 the	 “yang	 and
yin”	principles	of	vital	operations.	In	both	cases	a	tangible	dualism	of	forces	is
considered	 to	 be	 the	 substratum	 of	 reality;	 and	 if	 mechanism	 originated	 in	 a
generalization	of	muscular	action,	then	vitalism	can	indeed	be	traced	to	a	similar
generalization	of	the	reproductive	act—the	union	of	male	and	female	organs.	In
the	 new	 type	 of	 astrological	 vitalism,	 the	 stars	 and	 planets	 are	 considered	 as
magnets	or	radio	sets,	and	electrical	action,	being	always	of	a	polar	nature,	is	the
new	name	given	to	the	“vital	force”	of	older	thought.

The	 third	 stage	 of	 thought	 is	 called	 by	 Jeans	 “mathematical.”	 The	 main
feature	 of	 it	 is	 that	 pure	 mathematical	 speculation	 is	 seen	 to	 fit	 perfectly	 the
results	of	ever	more	complex	and	refined	experiments;	in	fact	it	often	precedes
experiments.	 Mathematical	 theories	 are	 built,	 and	 as	 the	 physicist	 looks	 for	 a
type	of	phenomena	to	which	the	theory	might	apply	he	often	finds	one,	hitherto
unexplained,	 which	 fits	 perfectly	 the	 purely	 abstract	 formulas.	 Moreover	 the
striking	thing	is	that	a	few	symbols—as	are	all	algebraic	or	mathematical	letters
or	 figures—are	 seen	 able	 to	 bring	 order	 and	 logical	 succession	 to	 the	 vast
complexity	 of	 natural	 phenomena.	 In	 other	 words,	 a	 few	 symbolical	 relations
(i.e.	formulas)	are	seen	to	suffice	for	the	ordering	of	the	multitude	of	the	world’s
events	into	a	pattern,	knowing	which	man	will	gain	relative	mastery	over	natural
elements	through	the	power	of	foreseeing.

### Quoting	again	from	Jeans’	book:

“Einstein	 has	 written	 (Introduction	 to	 Where	 Is	 Science	 Going?—	 page
13):	In	every	important	advance	the	physicist	finds	that	the	fundamental	laws
are	 simplified	 more	 and	 more	 as	 experimental	 research	 advances.	 He	 is
astonished	 to	 notice	 how	 sublime	 order	 emerges	 from	 what	 appeared	 to	 be
chaos.	And	this	cannot	be	traced	back	to	the	workings	of	his	own	mind	but	is
due	to	a	quality	that	is	inherent	in	the	world	of	perception’.	(This	conclusion
is	disputed	by	many	thinkers.	D.	R.)

“Weyl	 has	 made	 a	 similar	 comment,	 writing	 (The	 Open	 World,	 p.	 41):
‘The	astonishing	thing	is	not	that	there	exist	natural	laws,	but	that	the	further
the	 analysis	 proceeds,	 the	 finer	 the	 details,	 the	 finer	 the	 elements	 to	 which
the	phenomena	are	reduced,	the	simpler—and	not	the	more	complicated,	as
one	 would	 originally	 expect—the	 fundamental	 relations	 become	 and	 the
more	exactly	do	they	describe	the	actual	occurrences.’

“We	have	had	ample	evidence	of	this	tendency	toward	simplicity	in	the
present	 book.	 We	 have	 seen	 Hero’s	 simple	 synthesis	 of	 the	 two	 laws	 of
Euclid	 gradually	 expanding	 in	 scope	 until	 it	 embraces	 almost	 all	 the
activities	 of	 the	 universe,	 and	 yet	 maintaining	 its	 original	 simplicity	 of
mathematical	 form	 throughout.	 This	 refers	 to	 Einstein’s	 recent	 ‘Unitary
Field-Theory,’	 which,	 if	 it	 achieves	 complete	 success	 ‘will	 remain	 valid
whatever	physical	agencies	are	in	action,	so	that	we	shall	be	able	to	combine
all	the	operations	of	nature	in	one	synthesis:	they	will	have	become	shortest
courses	in	a	curved	four-dimensional	space’	(page	126).	Phenomenal	nature
is	reduced	to	an	array	of	events	in	the	four-dimensional	continuum,	and	the
arrangement	 of	 these	 events	 proves	 to	 be	 of	 an	 exceedingly	 simple
mathematical	kind.	.	.	.	This	simplicity	.	.	.	seems	to	admit	of	a	very	simple
mathematical	 interpretation	 and	 of	 no	 other,	 as	 though,	 in	 Boyle’s	 phrase,
mathematics	is	the	alphabet	of	the	language	in	which	nature	is	written.	The
words	 of	 this	 language	 may	 or	 may	 not	 be	 mental	 in	 their	 meanings;	 the
immediate	 point	 is	 that,	 even	 in	 the	 alphabet,	 we	 can	 discover	 no	 reality
different	in	kind	from	that	we	associate	with	a	mere	mental	concept.	These
mental	 concepts	 are	 not	 of	 the	 kind	 we	 associate	 with	 the	 work	 of	 the
engineer	 or	 the	 poet	 or	 the	 moralist,	 but	 with	 the	 thinker	 who	 works	 with
pure	 thought	 alone	 as	 his	 raw	 material,	 the	 mathematician	 at	 work	 in	 his
study.	.	.	.	For	three	centuries	science	had	projected	mechanical	ideas	on	to
nature,	 and	 made	 havoc	 of	 a	 large	 part	 of	 nature	 by	 so	 doing.	 Twentieth-

century	science,	projecting	the	ideas	of	pure	mathematics	on	to	nature,	finds
that	 they	 fit	 as	 perfectly	 and	 as	 uniquely	 as	 Cinderella’s	 slipper	 fitted	 her
foot.”

The	 phrase	 “projecting	 the	 ideas	 of	 pure	 mathematics	 on	 to	 nature”	 is
significant.	 It	 shows	 that	 in	 such	 a	 science	 as	 physics	 or	 chemistry—and	 in
general	in	all	empirical	sciences—three	elements	are	to	be	considered:	1)	natural
phenomena	or	data;	2)	ideas	of	pure	mathematics;	3)	a	system	of	interpretations
or	“laws,”	which	enable	man	to	prophesy	more	or	less	accurately	future	natural
phenomena.	This	is	an	important	fact	to	consider;	for	thereby	it	is	shown	that	a
fundamental	distinction	exists	between	mathematics	and	the	empirical	sciences.
Mathematics	 is	 used	 as	 the	 integrating	 factor	 in	 the	 building	 of	 the	 empirical
sciences.	 In	 a	 sense	 the	 latter	 are	 applications	 of	 mathematical	 ideas.
Mathematics	provides	the	 form	of	knowledge,	empirical	sciences	the	organized
contents	of	knowledge.

This	distinction	is	capital.	For	by	defining	astrology	as	the	algebra	of	life,	we
place	it	in	the	category	of	mathematical	thought	—and	not	in	that	of	empirical
sciences.	The	results	of	such	a	conception	are	far-reaching.

The	 word	 “algebra”	 comes	 from	 an	 Arabian	 word	 “al-jebr”	which	 means:
the	reduction	of	parts	to	a	whole.	The	word	“jabara,”	from	which	it	is	derived
signifies:	to	bind	together	(Webster).	Algebra	has	therefore	as	its	basic	function
the	binding	together,	or	correlating,	or	integrating	of	elements	into	a	formulated
whole.	 The	 nature	 of	 these	 elements	 can	 be	 grasped	 when	 we	 consider	 the
definition	 which	 Webster	 gives	 of	 “mathematics”:	 “The	 science	 treating	 of	 the
exact	relations	existing	between	quantities	or	magnitudes	and	operations,	and	of
the	methods	by	which,	in	accordance	with	these	relations,	quantities	sought	are
deducible	from	others	thought	or	supposed.”

Two	 important	 points	 stand	 out	 in	 such	 a	 definition.	 First,	 mathematics	 is
seen	 as	 a	 “science	 of	 pure	 correlation”	 (Bertrand	 Russell).	 Second,	 what	 it
correlates	are	“quantities	or	magnitudes	and	operations.”	Algebra	is	a	branch	of
mathematics,	 but	 besides	 correlating	 quantities	 it	 also	 deals	 with	 a	 category	 of
conventional	symbols	which	can	be	made	to	represent	any	element	considered	or
the	 relations	 between	 any	 groups	 of	 elements.	 According	 to	 our	 conception,
astrology	 is	 a	 kind	 of	 algebra,	 inasmuch	 as	 it	 deals	 with	 symbolic	 elements
(planets,	 stars,	 segments	 of	 geocentric	 space,	 astrological	 Parts,	 Nodes,
progressed	positions,	etc.)	which	it	“binds	together”	into	a	formula	describing	a
living	whole:	the	native.	However,	these	symbolic	elements	do	not	belong	to	the

realm	 of	 quantity.	 They	 represent,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 universal	 life-qualities.
Astrology	is	thus	a	kind	of	algebra	of	qualities;	and	these	qualities	are	not	mere
sensorial	qualities	(such	as	white,	blue,	thick,	heavy,	painful,	etc.),	but	qualities
the
which	 refer
psychological	and	super-psychological	planes.

### the	 physiological	 or

### to

We	shall	discuss	these	statements	step	by	step;	but	it	seems	necessary	at	first
to	emphasize	what	astrology	is	not,	before	we	can	specify	what	it	fundamentally
is.	 In	 other	 words,	 we	 have	 to	 show	 briefly	 that	 astrology	 is	 not	 an	 empirical
science,	 as	 are	 for	 instance	 physics,	 chemistry,	 or	 even	 biology,	 zoology	 and
history.	 These	 empirical	 sciences	 deal	 with	 experimental	 data	 which	 they
organize	 by	 using	 mathematical	 formal	 concepts.	 Such	 experimental	 data	 are
sensorially	 perceived—directly	 or	 by	 means	 of	 instruments	 which	 extend	 the
field	 of	 direct	 sensorial	 perception.	 Then	 by	 a	 process	 known	 as	 “scientific
induction”	 correlations	 are	 established	 between	 data	 which	 form	 the	 basis	 of
empirical	exact	knowledge.

Scientific	 induction	 is	 the	 basic	 postulate	 of	 exact	 sciences.	 It	 can	 be
formulated	in	various	ways	but,	according	to	Bertrand	Russell	(The	Analysis	of
Matter,	p.	167),	“it	must	yield	the	result	that	a	correlation	which	has	been	found
true	in	a	number	of	cases,	and	has	never	been	found	false,	has	at	least	a	certain
assignable	degree	of	probability	of	being	always	true.”	This	definition	is	of	great
importance	 to	 us,	 for	 who,	 among	 astrologers,	 will	 claim	 that	 any	 astrological
correlation	 for	 which	 a	 definite	 meaning	 has	 been	 recognized	 “has	 never	 been
found	false”?

But	this	is	not	all.	The	problem	of	making	astrology	“scientific”	in	the	sense
of	 an	 empirical	 science—even	 if	 not	 an	 “exact”	 science	 —is	 involved	 in	 the
proposition,	 or	 belief	 rather,	 that	 planets	 or	 stars	 actually	 influence	 individual
beings	by	the	fact	of	their	sending	to	earth	radio-like	waves,	or	rays,	which	affect
biological	 and	 psychological	 processes.	 Now,	 even	 if	 these	 “rays”	 were
discovered,	and	if	it	became	clear	that	they	act	upon	the	atoms	and	molecules	of
earth-substance	in	definite	and	measurable	ways,	this	would	in	no	way	prove	the
usual	findings	of	astrology.	A	restricted	kind	of	natal	astrology	might	be	evolved
which	 might	 claim—after	 centuries	 of	 research—the	 status	 of	 an	 experimental
science;	 but	 this	 would	 solve	 only	 a	 fragment	 of	 the	 problems	 involved	 in	 the
sum	total	of	astrological	ideas.

The	 reason	 for	 this	 is	 obvious.	 Let	 us	 admit	 that	 stellar	 or	 planetary	 rays
produce	physical	and	chemical	changes	in	the	substance	of	atoms	and	cells,	and

are	 thus	 able	 to	 condition	 psychological	 states.	 Let	 us	 suppose,	 moreover,	 that
these	changes	are	proven	to	be	measurable	in	terms	of	the	angular	relationship	of
the	 planets	 (astrological	 aspects)	 and	 are	 affected	 by	 the	 section	 of	 the	 earth’s
orbit	 (zodiacal	 sign)	 or	 of	 the	 geocentric	 space	 at	 birth	 (house)	 in	 which	 the
planets	or	stars	are	found.	This	in	itself	is	an	enormous	order,	which	may	never
be	 filled.	 But	 even	 if	 all	 of	 it	 were	 scientifically	 proven—the	 following	 basic
factors	in	astrology	would	remain	most	unscientific	mysteries,	as	far	as	we	can
see.

Why	should	the	first	house	represent	matters	affecting	self	and	the	structure
of	the	body;	the	second	house,	finances;	the	seventh	house,	marriage,	etc?	Why
should	zodiacal	signs	be	related	to	certain	parts	of	the	body?	Why	should	certain
planets	 “rule”	 certain	 signs?	 Furthermore,	 how	 could	 “progressions”	 be
“scientifically”	 explained?	 What	 could	 ever	 prove	 scientifically	 whether
primaries	 are	 true	 and	 secondaries	 false,	 or	 vice	 versa;	 that	 the	 distance	 in
degrees	between	two	planets	gives	(usually)	the	number	of	years	between	birth
and	an	occurrence	which	is	characterized	by	the	two	planets’	natures?

Then	what	of	horary	astrology,	i.e.,	solving	life-problems	by	interpreting	the
configurations	 of	 space	 and	 planets	 at	 the	 moment	 the	 problem	 arises	 in	 one’s
mind?	 “Scientific”	 astrologers	 may	 frown	 at	 horary	 astrology	 as	 being	 mere
fortune-telling.	 Nevertheless	 it	 is	 easy	 to	 show	 that	 natal	 astrology	 (study	 of
birth-charts)	 is	 a	 special	 case	 of	 horary	 astrology;	 for,	 as	 Marc	 Jones	 stated,
studying	a	birth-chart	is	merely	answering	the	question:	“How	is	the	problem	of
my	 life	 to	 be	 solved?”	 At	 least,	 this	 is	 just	 as	 logical	 a	 way	 of	 looking	 at	 the
relationship	between	horary	and	natal	astrology	as	the	one	formulated	by	saying:
“An	 horary	 chart	 is	 the	 birth-chart	 of	 an	 idea.”	 One	 may	 prefer	 the	 latter
interpretation,	 but	 the	 former	 cannot	 be	 dismissed	 easily,	 and	 the	 truth	 of	 the
matter	must	in	some	way	include	both	approaches.

It	is	useless	to	add	more	“whys”	to	this	already	long	list.	We	trust	it	will	be
apparent	 to	 everyone	 after	 some	 clear	 thinking	 on	 the	 matter	 that	 attempts	 at
making	 astrology	 an	 exact	 empirical	 science	 by	 basing	 it	 on	 measurements	 of
actual	influences	and	rays	are,	if	not	doomed	to	failure,	at	least	bound	to	explain
or	prove	only	a	fragment	of	the	entire	body	of	ideas	which	constitutes	and	has
always	constituted	astrology.	Whatever	science	may	discover	concerning	cosmic
radiations,	we	do	not	believe	that	the	philosophy	of	astrology	can	or	should	ever
be	the	same	as	that	of	an	empirical	science,	like	physics	or	mechanics	or	biology.
There	 is,	 however,	 a	 somewhat	 different	 category	 of	 sciences	 which	 are

based	 not	 on	 exact	 scientific	 induction	 and	 strict	 causality,	 but	 on	 statistical
knowledge.	 Dr.	 A.	 Ritchie-Scott	 mentions	 as	 belonging	 to	 this	 type	 in	 the
practical	 world	 “the	 whole	 theory	 of	 Insurance,	 Life-Annuities,	 the	 modern
theory	of	heat,	the	construction	of	telephone	exchanges,	the	Mendelian	theory	of
inheritance,	the	study	of	Population	Statistics,	Blood	Testing,	sampling	of	ores,
etc.	...	all	based	on	the	Theory	of	Probability	and	none	the	less	valid	for	that.”
(American	Astrology,	July	1934)

Besides	 these	 examples,	 it	 is	 now	 well	 known	 that	 atomic	 physics	 is
becoming	more	and	more	a	statistical	science,	especially	if	Heisenberg’s	theories
are	proven	to	be	correct;	for	they	“give	us	a	picture	of	a	statistical	atom	whose
properties	and	qualities	are	the	average	of	the	properties	and	qualities	of	all	the
actual	 atoms	 concerned	 in	 the	 emission	 of	 light.”	 (Sir	 James	 Jeans,	 op.	 cit.,	 p.
183).	 The	 new	 wave-mechanics	 “deals	 only	 with	 probabilities	 and	 statistical
assemblies,	and	its	apparent	determinism	may	be	only	another	way	of	expressing
the	 law	 of	 averages.	 The	 determinism	 may	 be	 of	 a	 purely	 statistical	 kind,	 like
that	 relied	 on	 by	 an	 Insurance	 Company,	 or	 the	 Bank	 at	 Monte	 Carlo.”	 Jeans
further	asserts:

“This	 being	 so,	 there	 is	 no	 assignable	 reason	 why	 the	 apparent
determinism	 of	 the	 wave-equation	 should	 not	 conceal	 a	 complete	 objective
indeterminism.	 In	 the	 mathematical	 problem	 known	 as	 the	 ‘random	 walk,’
we	imagine	that	a	traveller	walks	20	miles	a	day,	but	with	no	causal	relation
between	 the	 directions	 of	 his	 walks	 on	 successive	 days—we	 can,	 for
instance,	imagine	his	throwing	a	stick	up	in	the	air	at	random	every	morning,
and	letting	the	direction	of	its	fall	determine	the	direction	of	his	walk	for	the
day.	A	mathematical	formula	can	of	course	be	obtained	to	exhibit	the	chances
of	his	being	at	various	points	at	successive	nightfalls.	If	we	now	reduce	the
unit	of	time	from	a	day	to	a	second,	so	that	his	every	step	is	indeterminate,
we	find	that	the	probabilities	spread	out	in	waves,	much	as	in	Schrödinger’s
equation;	 the	 spread	 of	 the	 waves	 corresponds	 to	 a	 strict	 determinism,
although	 the	 underlying	 physical	 cause	 is	 a	 complete	 indeterminism.”	 (op.
cit.	p.	255)

“The	 only	 determinism	 of	 which	 modern	 physics	 is	 at	 all	 sure	 is	 of	 a
merely	statistical	kind.	We	still	see	the	actions	of	vast	crowds	of	molecules
or	 particles	 conforming	 to	 determinism—	 this	 is	 of	 course	 the	 determinism
we	 observe	 in	 our	 everyday	 life,	 the	 basis	 of	 the	 so-called	 law	 of	 the
uniformity	of	nature.	But	no	determinism	has	so	far	been	discovered	in	the

motions	 of	 the	 separate	 individuals;	 on	 the	 contrary,	 the	 phenomena	 of
radioactivity	and	radiation	rather	suggest	that	these	do	not	move	as	they	are
pushed	 and	 pulled	 by	 inexorable	 forces	 .	 .	 .	 they	 are	 not	 controlled	 by
predetermined	 forces,	 but	 only	 by	 the	 statistical	 laws	 of	 probability.”	 (pp.
275-276)

These	statements	have	a	very	direct	bearing	on	the	subject	of	astrology,	and
besides	will	bring	joy	to	the	heart	of	the	convinced	believer	in	the	principle	of
free-will.	 While	 the	 subject	 is	 too	 vast	 to	 be	 discussed	 here,	 two	 basic	 points
must	be	mentioned,	for	they	have	a	capital	importance	in	any	solid	philosophy	of
astrology.	 The	 first	 is	 that	 we	 shall	 always	 find	 in	 any	 type	 of	 thought	 dealing
with	life	a	fundamental	interpenetration	between	individual	values	and	collective
values.	 The	 individual	 may	 be	 free,	 but	 that	 freedom	 is	 certainly	 bound	 by	 the
magnetic	field,	or	aura,	of	the	collectivity	to	which	he	belongs—the	“Ring-Pass-
Not”	of	Oriental	occultism.	On	the	other	hand,	the	collectivity	is	also	influenced
and	 fecundated	 by	 the	 creative	 activity	 of	 those	 of	 its	 members	 who	 act	 as
individuals	and	not	merely	as	photostat	copies	of	the	collective	pattern,	or	soul.

These	two	elements,	individual	and	group,	must	figure	preeminently	in	any
astrological	 judgment;	 and	 this	 in	 various	 ways	 with	 which	 we	 shall	 deal
succinctly	as	we	go	on	in	our	study.	It	may	be	well,	however,	to	state	now	that	no
astrological	birth-chart	can	be	judged	with	accuracy,	if	the	general	conditions	of
the	group	to	which	the	native	belongs	as	an	individual,	are	unknown.	This	refers
both	 to	 the	 social	 group	 (family,	 race,	 religion)	 and	 to	 that	 other	 grouping	 in
consciousness	 which	 creates	 levels	 of	 being.	 The	 birth-chart	 will	 reveal
individual	tendencies,	but	these	will	manifest	actually	in	terms	of	the	condition
of	the	family,	city,	nation,	race	in	which	the	individual	is	born.	A	Chinese	coolie
may	 have	 exactly	 the	 same	 birth-chart	 as	 a	 European	 nobleman	 of	 a	 highly
cultured	 family,	 born	 at	 the	 same	 latitude.	 And	 it	 is	 obvious	 that	 no	 one	 could
infer	 accurately	 from	 the	 birth-chart	 alone	 what	 the	 Chinaman’s	 life	 would	 be,
especially	if	he	were	believed	to	be	a	European	nobleman.	For	a	life,	and	even
an	 individual’s	 character,	 are	 determined	 not	 only	 by	 the	 individual	 equation
(birth-chart),	 but	 by	 the	 group	 in	 which	 these	 manifest.	 Group-values	 may	 be
vaguely	 suggested	 in	 a	 chart,	 but	 only	 insofar	 as	 they	 affected	 the	 pre-natal
formation	of	the	individual.

Does	the	above	invalidate	astrology?	We.	do	not	believe	so;	but	it	serves	to
define	 its	 sphere.	 A	 birth-chart	 as	 a	 whole	 refers	 to	 an	 individual	 as	 such
(potentially	 or	 actually)	 and	 deals	 with	 individual	 values.	 But	 any	 separate

astrological	factor—as	for	instance	the	position	of	a	certain	planet	or	an	aspect
between	two	particular	planets—has	only	a	statistical	value.	And	this	is	why	no
particular	 astrological	 factor	 does	 necessarily	 operate	 in	 the	 same	 very	 definite
way	in	all	individual	birth-charts.	It	is	only	statistically	accurate—or,	as	we	shall
see	presently,	symbolically	significant.

Bertrand	 Russell’s	 words	 concerning	 the	 statistical	 principle	 will	 add	 more

### clarity	to	the	above	statements:

“It	might	be	thought	that	a	statistical	average	is	not	very	different	from	a
rule	 with	 exceptions,	 but	 this	 would	 be	 a	 mistake.	 Statistics,	 ideally,	 are
accurate	laws	about	large	groups;	they	differ	from	other	laws	only	in	being
about	groups,	not	about	individuals.	Statistical	laws	are	inferred	by	induction
from	particular	statistics,	just	as	other	laws	are	inferred	from	particular	single
occurrences.”	(op.	cit.	p.	191)

In	other	words,	a	science	is	no	less	“scientific”	because	it	deals	with	statistical
averages	rather	than	with	single	occurrences;	only	it	is	to	be	clearly	regarded	as	a
science	dealing	with	large	groups	and	not	with	individuals.

From	this	it	might	seem	that	astrology	could	be	considered	as	an	empirical
science	 of	 statistical	 type.	 But	 such	 a	 conclusion	 does	 not	 seem	 to	 be	 fully
warranted.	 Astrology	 may	 utilize	 the	 statistical	 method	 to	 check	 up	 its
statements,	 and	 will	 do	 well	 to	 adopt	 such	 a	 technique—which	 has	 never	 been
used	 with	 any	 great	 degree	 of	 scientific	 accuracy	 and	 on	 a	 large	 enough	 scale.
But	 to	 say	 that,	 is	 quite	 different	 from	 claiming	 astrology	 as	 a	 true	 statistical
science.	 Statistics	 may	 show	 that	 among	 famous	 people	 the	 sextile	 Sun-Moon
occurs	in	a	12	per	cent	ratio;	while	in	ordinary	human	beings	it	occurs	only	in
about	 5	 in	 100	 cases	 (the	 example	 is	 given	 by	 the	 French	 mathematician-
astrologer	 Paul	 Choisnard).	 This	 might	 indicate	 a	 certain	 correlation	 between
that	 aspect	 and	 “celebrity”	 (whatever	 is	 meant	 by	 that!).	 But	 the	 inference	 is
rather	inconclusive.	And	even	if	it	could	be	proven	that	90	per	cent	of	especially
gifted	 musicians	 have	 a	 dominant	 Neptunian	 influence,	 and	 that	 as	 many
prominent	soldiers	have	the	Sun	in	Aries,	etc,	it	would	merely	mean	that	certain
astrological	statements	are	corroborated	by	statistical	research.	It	would	neither
indicate	 how	 these	 astrological	 facts	 had	 originally	 been	 discovered,	 nor,	 I
believe,	the	correct	method	of	discovering	new	astrological	truths;	and	still	less
why	the	statements	are	correct.	Moreover,	it	would	apply	only	to	single	separate
factors	 in	 astrology	 and	 not	 to	 the	 quite	 different	 problem	 of	 interpreting	 an

entire	birth-chart	as	the	symbol	of	an	individual.

How	 are	 discoveries	 made	 in	 modern	 physics?	 The	 classical	 explanation	 is
that	a	physicist	observes	a	fact	which	is	new,	or	ponders	upon	some	flaw	in	an
old	 theory,	 and	 formulates	 a	 new	 hypothesis	 which	 explains	 the	 new	 fact	 or
solves	the	old	unsolved	enigma.	The	hypothesis	is	then	checked	by	testing	all	the
possible	 consequences	 thereof;	 and	 it	 becomes	 an	 accepted	 theory	 if	 it	 fits	 in
with	 every	 known	 fact	 and	 is	 invalidated	 by	 none.	 We	 might	 assume	 that
astrology	originated	in	a	similar	manner.	Some	striking	event	coincided	with	an
equally	 striking	 planetary	 conjunction.	 The	 hypothesis	 that	 both	 were	 related
arose	in	the	mind	of	an	observer,	who	checked	it	up	with	similar	occurrences—
and	 after	 a	 few	 generations	 of	 checking	 up,	 this	 conjunction	 was	 definitely
considered	to	bring	about	a	certain	event,	or	at	least	a	certain	type	of	event.

Whether	astrology	originated	in	such	a	manner	or	not	can	hardly	be	proved
or	 disproved.	 If	 it	 did	 so	 originate,	 then	 we	 claim	 that	 astrology	 has	 reached	 a
time	 when	 its	 value	 is	 to	 be	 keyed	 up	 to	 an	 entirely	 different	 plane	 of
consciousness,	 to	 another	 mental	 level.	 In	 this,	 it	 would	 follow	 the	 course	 of
development	which	mathematics	and	geometry	have	presumably	taken.	We	may
believe	that	men	began	to	think	of	numerals	purely	in	relation	to	concrete	objects
—two	 apples,	 three	 stones,	 etc.;	 or	 thought	 of	 a	 triangle	 as	 a	 class	 of	 objects
having	 a	 certain	 apparent	 shape.	 Then	 the	 abstract	 idea	 of	 number,	 or	 triangle,
developed	in	man’s	mind	—yet	always	with	some	sort	of	concrete	background
not	 entirely	 separated	 from	 sensorial	 experience.	 Finally	 the	 modern	 stage	 was
reached	 in	 which	 non-Euclidian	 geometries	 and	 the	 higher	 forms	 of	 algebra
completely	robbed	number	and	geometrical	form	of	any	representative	elements,
and	reduced	them	to	strictly	logical	symbols.
Says	Bertrand	Russell	(op.	cit.,	p.	171):

“Propositions	which	form	part	of	logic,	or	can	be	proved	by	logic,	are	all
tautologies.—i.e.,	 they	 show	 that	 certain	 different	 sets	 of	 symbols	 are
different	ways	of	saying	the	same	thing,	or	that	one	set	says	part	of	what	the
other	 says.	 .	 .	 .	 Such	 propositions,	 therefore,	 are	 really	 concerned	 with
symbols.	We	can	know	their	truth	or	falsehood	without	studying	the	outside
world,	because	they	are	only	concerned	with	symbolic	manipulations.	...	All
pure	 mathematics	 consists	 of	 tautologies	 in	 the	 above	 sense.	 .	 .	 .	 Our
certainty	 concerning	 simple	 mathematical	 propositions	 does	 not	 seem
analogous	to	our	certainty	that	the	sun	will	rise	tomorrow.	I	do	not	mean	that
we	feel	more	sure	of	the	one	than	the	other,	though	perhaps	we	ought	to	do

so;	 I	 mean	 that	 our	 assurance	 seems	 to	 have	 a	 different	 source.	 .	 .	 .	 It	 is
obvious	that,	whenever	it	is	actually	useful	to	know	that	two	sets	of	symbols
say	the	same	thing,	or	that	one	says	part	of	what	the	other	says,	that	must	be
because	 we	 have	 some	 knowledge	 as	 to	 the	 truth	 or	 falsehood	 of	 what	 is
expressed	by	one	of	the	sets.	Consequently	logical	knowledge	would	be	very
unimportant	 if	 it	 stood	 alone;	 its	 importance	 arises	 through	 its	 combination
with	knowledge	of	propositions	which	are	not	purely	logical.

.	 .	 .	 In	 an	 advanced	 science	 such	 as	 physics,	 the	 part	 played	 by	 pure
mathematics	 consists	 in	 connecting	 various	 empirical	 generalizations	 with
each	other,	so	that	the	more	general	laws	which	replace	them	are	based	upon
a	larger	number	of	matters	of	fact.”

### Astrology	Compared	to	Logic	and	Mathematics

This	 quotation	 contains	 several	 statements	 which	 are	 very	 important	 at	 this
stage	of	our	inquiry	into	the	essential	nature	of	astrology.	Mathematics,	it	is	said,
is	 concerned	 with	 symbols,	 the	 truth	 or	 falsehood	 of	 which	 can	 be	 known
without	studying	the	outside	world.	Mathematical	propositions,	Bertrand	Russell
adds	 in	 another	 paragraph,	 are	 thus	 purely	 formal.	 He	 further	 makes	 clear	 that
mathematics	and	logic	are	sciences	in	an	entirely	different	sense	from	the	sense
in	which,	for	instance,	physics	is	a	science.	The	former	are	analytical	and	formal;
the	 latter	 is	 empirical.	 Yet	 physics	 without	 mathematics	 would	 lack	 the	 very
power	of	correlating	logically	its	generalizations.

If,	now,	we	come	back	to	our	definition	of	astrology	as	the	algebra	of	life,	we
shall	 make	our	meaning	plainer	by	stating	that	astrology	is	to	all	the	empirical
sciences	 dealing	 with	 the	 formation,	 growth,	 behavior	 and	 disintegration	 of
organic	 wholes	 what	 mathematics	 is	 to	 physics	 and	 in	 general	 to	 sciences	 of
inanimate	objects.	We	do	not	say	that	it	is	recognized	as	such,	but	that	such	is	its
true	function.	And	this	is	to	some	extent	a	verifiable	statement.

Astrology	 of	 itself	 has	 no	 more	 meaning	 than	 algebra.	 It	 measures
relationships	 between	 symbols	 whose	 concreteness	 is	 entirely	 a	 matter	 of
convention,	 and	 does	 not	 really	 enter	 into	 the	 problems	 involved—just	 as	 the
symbols	of	algebra,	x,	y,	n,	are	mere	conventions.	The	astrologers	use	terms	like
opposition,	 conjunction,	 squares,	 exactly	 as	 the	 mathematician	 uses	 signs	 of
addition	and	multiplication.	Their	“progressions”	are	also	very	much	in	the	same
category	 as	 the	 more	 complicated	 symbols	 of	 calculus—the	 function	 sign,	 etc.
The	revolutions	of	celestial	bodies	constitute	in	their	totality	a	vast	and	complex
symbol	 which,	 of	 itself,	 is	 made	 up	 solely	 of	 cyclically	 changing	 patterns	 of

relationship.	 It	 does	 not	 matter	 in	 the	 least	 whether	 it	 is	 planets,	 or	 abstract
points	 derived	 from	 planetary	 motions,	 or	 segments	 of	 orbits,	 or	 symbolical
points	 of	 reference	 like	 meridian,	 horizon	 and	 the	 like,	 which	 are	 considered.
Planets	are	significant	and	convenient	vehicles	for	symbolical	meaning	because
they	 bear	 relatively	 simple	 relations	 of	 distance,	 velocity,	 mass,	 period,	 to	 a
central	point	of	reference,	the	Sun—or	rather	to	the	Earth’s	orbit	around	the	Sun.
In	other	words,	the	astrological	realm	of	moving	celestial	bodies	is	like	the
realm	 of	 logical	 propositions.	 Neither	 one	 nor	 the	 other	 has	 any	 real	 content.
Both	 are	 purely	 formal,	 symbolical,	 and	 conventional.	 They	 acquire	 real	 value
only	 in	 function	 of	 the	 actual	 living	 experiences	 which	 they	 serve	 to	 correlate.
Alone,	 astrology	 and	 mathematics	 are	 without	 substance.	 But	 they	 invest	 with
coherence,	pattern,	logic	and	order	whatever	substantial	reality	is	associated	with
them.	 Thus	 mathematics	 associated	 with	 physical	 experimentation	 produces
modern	physics.	In	a	similar	manner	(yet	obviously	not	identical)	astrology	can
and	probably	should	be	associated	with	physiology,	geology,	medicine,	history,
sociology;	and	above	all,	with	psychology.

The	 fact	 is	 that	 when	 astrology	 played	 a	 really	 vital	 part	 in	 ancient
civilizations	it	was	so	considered—if	not	by	the	rabble,	at	least	undoubtedly	by
the	 initiated	 astrologers.	 We	 saw	 in	 our	 first	 chapter	 that	 the	 function	 of
astrology	was	to	bring	into	the	chaos	of	the	natural	world	on	Earth	the	supreme
order	 of	 which	 celestial	 revolutions	 are	 so	 conspicuous	 and	 psychologically
exalting	 a	 manifestation.	 Chaos	 and	 imprevisibility	 and	 blind	 chance	 on	 Earth;
but	 above	 in	 the	 heavens,	 perfect	 order,	 previsibility,	 law.	 Astrology	 took	 its
significance	 from	 such	 a	 contrast.	 The	 skies	 were	 regarded	 as	 a	 cosmic
measuring	 device,	 an	 archetypal	 paragon	 of	 order,	 which	 could	 be	 juxtaposed
with	 any	 system	 of	 natural	 phenomena.	 From	 this	 juxtaposition	 would	 result	 a
new	view	of	the	system	of	natural	phenomena:	an	ordered,	coherent	view,	which
would	lead	to	the	possibility	of	making	prognostications	as	to	the	future	behavior
of	the	system.

This	 is	 not	 very	 different	 from	 what	 science	 does	 when	 measuring	 with	 a
yard-stick	 or	 timing	 with	 a	 clock	 a	 natural	 phenomenon.	 The	 complete	 set	 of
planetary,	 solar,	 lunar	 and	 stellar	 revolutions,	 as	 seen	 from	 the	 Earth,	 has	ever
served	in	astrology	as	a	complex	many-dimensional	yard-stick	and	as	a	clock,	in
order	to	determine	the	periodical	behavior	of	natural	organisms—in	fact,	as	we
shall	see	presently,	of	any	whole	(the	Earth	as	a	whole,	a	living	body,	a	human
psyche,	a	nation,	etc.).

Modern	physics	has	rightly	stressed	the	fact	that	such	measurements	involve
certain	difficulties	and	are	relative	to	the	position	and	motion	of	the	observer.	In
order	to	measure	a	distance,	one	must	put	the	beginning	of	the	yard-stick	first	at
a	definite	point.	In	astrology,	all	measurements	begin	with	the	first	point	of	in-
dependent	existence;	in	the	case	of	a	human	destiny,	the	first	breath.	The	zodiac
—(which,	 let	 us	 not	 forget,	 is	 only	 the	 orbit	 of	 the	 earth	 divided	 into	 twelve
thirty-degree	 sections,	 and	 has	 little	 or	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 constellations)—is
measured	 as	 if	 beginning	 at	 the	 spring	 equinox,	 because	 at	 such	 a	 time	 a	 new
cycle	of	vegetation	begins	in	the	Northern	latitudes,	where	apparently	astrology
originated.

In	 other	 words,	 if	 we	 wish	 to	 investigate	 the	 laws	 of	 periodicity	 and	 of
structural	relationship	which	will	apply	to	a	human	life	starting	on	a	certain	day,
we	 project	 on	 paper	 the	 state	 of	 our	 cosmic	 measuring	 rod	 (the	 solar	 system
viewed	from	the	place	of	birth)	at	that	time,	and	measure	with	it	the	organism	of
natural	elements	which	has	just	reached	the	condition	of	independent	existence.
Does	 the	 cosmic	 measuring	 rod	 and	 timepiece	 combined	 —the	 birth-chart—
mean	 in	 itself	 anything	 substantial?	 Not	 in	 the	 least—no	 more	 than	 any	 yard-
stick	or	clock.	It	is	merely	a	symbol	of	measurement.	Unless	we	know	first	of	all
what	 it	 is	 we	 want	 to	 measure,	 we	 shall	 know	 nothing	 practical	 after	 having
measured-only	a	set	of	algebraic	symbols	on	a	wheel.	If	we	do	not	know	human
nature,	 a	 birth-chart	 will	 give	 us	 no	 indication	 whatsoever	 on	 the	 nature	 of	 a
particular	 human	 being.	 Unless	 we	 know	 about	 air-currents,	 atmospheric
pressure,	etc.,	an	astrological	chart	will	tell	us	nothing	of	the	weather.	Jupiter	and
Mars	do	not	mean	anything	concrete	whatsoever.	They	mean	no	more,	no	less,
than	3	and	4,	or	a	spiral	and	a	straight	line,	or	m	and	p.	But	if	we	say:	Here	is	a
newborn	human	body.	It	contains	in	itself	the	power	to	grow	to	full	stature,	the
powers	 of	 blood-circulation,	 of	 food-metabolization,	 of	 self-reproduction
through	 sex,	 and	 many	 other	 life-properties	 which	 characterize	 this	 body	 as
belonging	to	the	human	species—then	we	can	attempt	to	bring	order	out	of	this
apparent	 chaos	 of	 powers,	 functions	 and	 life-properties	 by	 juxtaposing	 our
celestial	symbols	to	them.

Jupiter	will	symbolize	the	power	of	expansion;	Mars	the	power	of	out-going
impulses;	 Venus	 the	 power	 of	 combining	 reactions	 to	 stimuli	 as	 conscious
judgment	and	emotion,	etc.	But,	if	we	dealt	with	atmospheric	conditions	instead
of	with	a	human	being,	Jupiter,	Mars,	Venus	would	of	course	interpret	altogether
different	 things—like	 atmospheric	 pressure	 and	 other	 telluric	 factors.	 Because
the	 latter	 are	 as	 yet	 very	 little	 known	 and	 the	 planet	 Earth	 has	 not	 yet	 been

understood	and	studied	as	an	organic	whole-astrological	symbolism	is	not	very
useful	to	meteorology	and	related	sciences.	At	best,	the	astrologer	will	say	that	a
strong	Jupiter	may	indicate	an	intense	state	of	expansion.	But	expansion	applied
to	what?	The	“what”	can	be	known	accurately	only	when	the	organic	behavior	of
the	Earth	as	a	whole	is	well	understood;	that	is	to	say,	when	all	the	functions	of
this	 planetary	 organism	 are	 isolated.	 Then	 astrology	 can	 correlate	 and	 interpret
these	 functions—just	 as	 mathematics	 correlates	 and	 interprets	 observations
furnished	 by	 the	 microscope	 and	 electrical	 devices,	 bearing	 upon	 the	 inside
structure	of	the	atom.

To	the	above,	objections	undoubtedly	will	be	raised.	Text-books	on	astrology
will	be	shown,	in	which	the	planets,	their	positions	and	aspects,	are	given	most
definite	and	concrete	meanings.	Indeed,	it	is	so;	but	these	text-books	are	merely
popular	 presentations	 of	 traditional	 data	 concerning	 the	 correlations	 of
astrological	symbols	to	certain	realms	of	experience	which	happened	to	interest
men	most	particularly.	They	do	not	deal	essentially	with	pure	astrology,	but	with
certain	particular	applications	of	astrological	symbolism.	These	applications	are
based	on	traditional	knowledge	concerning	such	 things	as	psychology	and	old-
time	government;	and	are	valuable	only	insofar	as	this	traditional	knowledge	is
valuable.

The	 interpretations	 of	 astrological	 elements	 given	 by	 most	 of	 our
contemporary	 text-books	 on	 astrology	 are	 just	 as	 valuable	 as	 the	 traditional
knowledge	of	human	psychology	and	government	was	at	the	time	of	Ptolemy,	in
Alexandria.	Insofar	as	human	psychology	and	sociology	have	changed	since	that
time,	they	are	 valueless.	But	 as	 human	 nature	 is	 after	 all	 quite	 constant	 on	 the
whole,	 the	 applications	 of	 astrological	 symbolism	 made	 by	 Ptolemy	 and	 his
predecessors	are	still	largely	true	today—but	obviously	quite	false,	or	beside	the
point,	or	incomplete,	in	innumerable	cases.

The	fundamental	point	to	grasp	however—and	it	seems	a	difficult	one	for	so
many	 people!—is	 that	 ordinary	 books	 on	 astrology	 today	 give	 merely	 the
application	 of	 astrological	 symbolism	 to	 a	 few	 traditional	 subjects:	 character,
health,	 happiness,	 and	 matters	 affecting	 the	 State,	 etc.	 These	 applications	 are
based	on	a	traditional	common-sense	view	of	the	subjects	involved,	and	stand	or
fall	with	this	traditional	view.	If	they	fall	it	does	not	in	the	least	imply	that	the
principles	on	which	astrology	is	based,	as	a	science	of	symbolism,	are	wrong.	No
more	than	mathematics	proved	to	be	a	failure	when	the	discovery	of	the	quantum
upset	 the	 whole	 fabric	 of	 modern	 physics.	 Similarly,	 the	 discoveries	 of
psychoanalysis,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 new	 social	 conditions	 prevailing	 today,	 have

invalidated	many	of	the	traditional	statements	reproduced	in	modern	astrological
text-books	 with	 regard	 to	 psychology	 and	 social	 behavior	 and	 professional
abilities.	 But	 astrology	 proper	 remains	 untouched	 by	 such	 changes:	 for,	 just	 as
Bertrand	 Russell	 says	 of	 logic:	 “We	 can	 know	 (its)	 truth	 or	 falsehood	 without
studying	 the	 outside	 world,	 because	 (it	 is)	 only	 concerned	 with	 symbolic
manipulations.”	 Paraphrasing	 him	 further,	 we	 would	 add:	 Our	 certainty
concerning	 simple	 astrological	 propositions	 does	 not	 seem	 analogous	 to	 our
certainty	concerning	simple	psychological	facts,	like	the	fact	that	a	girl	will	fall
in	love	some	time	in	her	life,	or	pass	through	an	emotional	crisis	in	her	forties.
Our	assurance	comes	from	a	different	source.

To	try	to	define	or	at	least	suggest	what	this	source	is—such	is	our	next	task;
a	difficult	one,	because	it	involves	a	type	of	attitude	to	life	and	to	consciousness
which	 is	 quite	 removed	 from	 the	 official	 and	 normal	 one	 prevalent	 in	 our
academic	and	intellectual	civilization.	We	shall	approach	the	subject	first	of	all
by	 studying	 briefly	 a	 type	 of	 development	 in	 modern	 thought	 which	 is	 at	 the
same	time	new	in	its	formulation,	yet	very	ancient	in	its	ancestry:	we	refer	to	the
philosophy	called	“Holism.”

### The	Philosophy	of	Holism

This	 philosophy	 is	 expounded	 fully	 in	 a	 remarkable	 book,	 “Holism	 and
Evolution,”	 written	 in	 1926	 by	 a	 still	 more	 remarkable	 man,	 General	 Jan	 C.
Smuts,	statesman,	philosopher	and	scientist.	An	article	in	the	latest	edition	of	the
Encyclopaedia	 Britannica	 under	 the	 name	 “Holism,”	 also	 written	 by	 General
Smuts,	 gives	 a	 general	 summary	 of	 the	 ideas	 developed	 in	 the	 book.	 We	 shall
quote	somewhat	extensively	from	this	article:

“Holism	 is	 the	 theory	 which	 makes	 the	 existence	 of	 ‘wholes’	 a
fundamental	feature	of	the	world.	It	regards	natural	objects,	both	animate	and
inanimate,	as	wholes	and	not	merely	as	assemblages	of	elements	or	parts.	It
looks	upon	nature	as	consisting	of	discrete,	concrete	bodies	and	things,	and
not	as	a	diffuse	homogeneous	continuum.	And	these	bodies	or	things	are	not
entirely	resolvable	into	parts;	in	one	degree	or	another	they	are	wholes	which
are	more	than	the	sum	of	their	parts,	and	the	mechanical	putting	together	of
their	parts	will	not	produce	them	or	account	for	their	character	and	behavior.
The	 so-called	 parts	 are	 in	 fact	 not	 real	 but	 largely	 abstract	 analytical
distinctions,	and	do	not	properly	or	adequately	express	what	has	gone	to	the
making	of	the	thing	as	a	whole.

“Holism	is	therefore	a	viewpoint	additional	and	complementary	to	that	of
science,	 whose	 keywords	 are	 continuity	 and	 mechanism	 .	 .	 .	 (Science’s)
mechanistic	scheme	applies	even	to	living	bodies,	as	their	material	structures
determine	the	functions	which	constitute	life	characters.	.	.	.	Life	and	mind
are	considered	as	derivative	and	epiphenomenal	to	matter.	.	.	.	The	scientific
scheme	 has	 been	 seriously	 undermined	 by	 the	 most	 recent	 discoveries	 in
physical	 and	 mathematical	 science.*	 .	 .	 .	 The	 value	 of	 the	 mechanistic
concept	for	research	is	not	questioned,	but	it	can	no	longer	be	considered	as	a
true	index	of	the	concrete	character	of	the	universe	and	its	contents.	Holism
is	 an	 attempt	 to	 explore	 an	 alternative	 scheme	 which	 will	 yet	 avoid	 the
pitfalls	of	vitalism.

“What	is	involved	in	the	concept	of	a	whole?	In	the	first	place,	insofar	as
a	whole	is	consisting	of	parts	or	elements,	they	cannot	be	fixed,	constant,	or
unalterable.	 .	 .	 .	 Whole	 and	 parts	 mutually	 and	 reciprocally	 influence	 and
modify	each	other.	.	.	.	The	parts	are	moulded	and	adjusted	by	the	whole,	just
as	the	whole	in	turn	depends	on	the	co-operation	of	its	parts.	.	.	.	The	concept
of	the	whole	as	applied	to	natural	objects	thus	implies	two	great	departures
from	the	orthodox	scientific	scheme.	In	the	first	place,	matter,	life	and	mind
do	not	consist	of	fixed,	constant	and	unalterable	elements.	And	in	the	second
place,	 besides	 the	 parts	 or	 the	 elements	 in	 things,	 there	 is	 another	 active
factor	(the	whole)	which	science	does	not	recognize	at	all.

“Evolution	 is	 the	 progressive	 complexifying	 of	 parts	 or	 cooperating
elements,	 with	 a	 simultaneous	 increase	 in	 unity	 of	 pattern	 with	 which	 they
are	 blended.	 It	 is	 thus	 a	 rising	 series	 of	 wholes,	 from	 the	 simplest	 material
patterns	to	the	most	advanced.	.	.	.	Wholeness,	or	holism,	characterizes	 the
entire	process	of	evolution	in	an	ever	increasing	measure.	And	the	process	is
continuous	 in	 the	 sense	 that	 the	 older	 types	 of	 wholes	 or	 patterns	 are	 not
discarded,	but	become	the	starting	point	and	the	elements	of	the	newer,	more
advanced	patterns.	Thus	the	material	chemical	patterns	are	incorporated	into
the	 biological	 patterns,	 and	 both	 of	 them	 into	 the	 subsequent	 psychical
patterns	 or	 wholes.	 .	 .	 .	 Electrons	 and	 protons,	 atoms	 and	 molecules,
inorganic	and	organic	compounds,	colloids,	protoplasm,	plants	and	animals,
minds	and	personalities	are	but	some	steps	in	this	movement	of	holism.	.	.	.

“The	 whole	 is	 creative;	 wherever	 parts	 conspire	 to	 form	 a	 whole,	 there
something	 arises	 which	 is	 more	 than	 the	 parts.	 .	 .	 .	 The	 origin	 of	 a	 whole
from	its	parts	is	an	instance	of	the	more	arising	from	the	less,	the	higher	from
the	lower,	in	a	way	which	does	no	violence	to	reason	.	.	.	because	the	concept

### of	a	whole	in	relation	to	its	parts	is	a	product	of	reason.	.	.	.”

### (Encyclopaedia	Britannica:	“Holism”)

General	Smuts	explains	further	how	the	concept	of	purely	mechanical	causation
is	 unsatisfactory	 and	 possibly	 a	 fiction,	 for	 if	 the	 effect	 is	 never	 more	 than	 the
cause,	if	cause	is	and	must	always	necessarily	be	an	exact	measure	of	effect,	this
cannot	 be	 a	 creative	 progressive	 universe.	 Holistic	 causation	 (where	 several
factors	contribute	to	the	making	of	new	wholes)	is	the	real	process,	and	makes
possible	the	increase	and	advance	which	is	actually	the	fact	in	nature.	Also	if	the
cause	 determines	 the	 effect	 completely,	 determinism	 is	 absolute.	 In	 the	 holistic
universe	freedom	is	recognized	as	inherent	in	nature.

The	 organic	 unity	 which	 constitutes	 a	 whole	 is	 the	 ultimate	 basis	 of
individuality.	 Hardly	 noticeable	 in	 the	 inorganic	 realm,	 individuality	 increases
throughout	the	organic	world	until	it	becomes	the	basis	for	the	latest	and	greatest
whole	of	evolution,	the	human	personality.	Out	of	the	progressive	evolutionary
combination	or	integration	of	material,	chemical,	biological,	and	mental	patterns,
the	 complete	 personality	 is	 born,	 which	 constitutes	 and	 explains	 the	 unity	 and
interrelations	existing	between	these	three	sets	of	patterns.

The	whole,	looked	at	from	an	external	mechanical	standpoint,	is	what	we	call
parts.	But	from	an	inner	integral	standpoint,	the	whole	is	the	self.	The	relation	of
whole	 and	 parts	 is	 thus	 transformed	 into	 the	 relation	 of	 self	 to	 not-self,	 with
which	we	are	acquainted	as	the	subject-object	relation	in	psychology.	Wholeness
is	selfness.	The	world-process	tends	from	matter,	through	life,	to	mind	and	spirit;
from	 necessity	 to	 freedom;	 from	 the	 externality	 of	 the	 elements	 to	 the
inwardness	and	selfhood	of	wholes.	Whole-making	characterizes	this	process	at
every	 stage.	 This	 applies	 to	 psychological	 processes,	 in	 which	 there	 is	 an
increasing	building-up	of	higher	patterns	out	of	lower	ones.	Gestalt	 psychology
has	 shown,	 for	 instance,	 that	 mental	 activity	 produces	 patterns	 or	 structures	 of
experience	 which	 behave	 as	 wholes	 and	 enter	 into	 other	 experiences	 as
undivided	and	indivisible	wholes.

While	the	same	is	true	with	regard	to	social,	religious	and	political	structures,
these	 are	 holoids	 rather	 than	 wholes;	 and	 the	 real	 wholes	 are	 always	 the
personalities	who	have	built	these	structures	for	the	purpose	of	the	growth	and
spiritual	advancement	of	all	human	individuals.	General	Smuts	does	not	believe
that	the	individual	is	for	the	sake	of	State	or	 Church,	but	 vice	 versa.	As	to	the
possibility	that	the	universe	might	be	also	a	whole,	he	refuses	to	take	a	positive
stand,	 saying	 only	 that	 “this	 is	 not	 a	 completed	 universe,	 but	 a	 universe	 in	 the

making;	 and	 there	 may	 be	 wholes	 great	 and	 small	 in	 the	 making	 beyond	 the
comprehension	of	our	limited	faculties.”	And	he	concludes	with	these	beautiful
words:

“Although	the	theory	of	holism	frankly	accepts	the	material	basis	of	the
world	 and	 recognizes	 the	 natural	 order	 as	 idealism	 cannot,	 yet	 it	 fully
justifies	the	claims	of	the	spirits	in	the	interpretation	of	the	world.	.	.	.	We	are
constantly	confronted	with	the	opposition	between	matter	and	spirit,	between
the	temporal	and	the	eternal,	between	the	phenomenal	and	the	real.	Holism
shows	these	opposites	as	reconciled	and	harmonized	in	the	whole.	It	shows
whole	 and	 parts	 as	 aspects	 of	 each	 other;	 the	 finite	 is	 identified	 with	 the
infinite,	the	particular	with	the	universal.	Eternity	is	contained	in	time,	matter
is	the	vesture	and	vehicle	of	spirit,	reality	is	not	a	transcendent	other-worldly
order,	but	is	immanent	in	the	phenomenal.	To	attain	to	reality,	we	need	not
fly	 from	 appearance;	 each	 little	 centre	 and	 whole	 in	 the	 world,	 however
lowly,	 is	 a	 laboratory	 in	 which	 time	 is	 transmuted	 into	 eternity,	 the
phenomenal	into	the	real.	The	wondrous	truth	is	everywhere;	the	plummet	let
down	anywhere	will	reach	to	unknown	depths;	any	cross-section	in	the	world
of	appearance	will	reveal	the	very	texture	of	reality.	Everywhere	the	whole,
even	 the	 least	 and	 most	 insignificant	 apparently,	 is	 the	 real	 wonder,	 the
miracle	 which	 holds	 the	 secrets	 for	 which	 we	 are	 groping	 in	 thought	 and
conduct.	There	is	the	within	which	is	the	beyond.	To	be	a	whole	and	to	live
in	 the	 whole	 becomes	 the	 supreme	 principle,	 from	 which	 all	 the	 highest
ethical	 and	 spiritual	 rules	 (such	 as	 the	 Golden	 Rule)	 follow.	 And	 it	 links
these	 rules	 with	 the	 nature	 of	 things,	 for	 not	 only	 do	 goodness,	 love	 and
justice	 derive	 from	 it,	 but	 also	 beauty	 and	 truth,	 which	 are	 rooted	 in	 the
whole	 and	 have	 no	 meaning	 apart	 from	 it.	 The	 whole	 is	 in	 fact	 both	 the
source	and	the	principle	of	explanation	of	all	our	highest	ideals	no	less	than
of	the	earlier	evolutionary	structures.”

### Astrology	and	Holistic	Logic

The	 whole	 is	 also	 “the	 source	 and	 the	 principle	 of	 explanation”	 of	 true
astrology.	As	we	understand	it,	and	as	it	has	perhaps	always	been	understood	by
those	 who	 probed	 its	 most	 essential	 significance,	 true	 astrology	 is	 the
mathematics	of	wholeness.	It	is	“holistic	logic”	in	opposition	to	the	“intellectual
logic”	 of	 this	 present	 Western	 civilization.	 It	 deals	 with	 wholes.	 It	 studies	 the
the	 disintegration	 or
the	 growth,	 development	 and
structural	 harmony,

transfiguration	 of	 wholes—whether	 these	 be	 the	 usual	 biological	 organisms	 or
more	transcendent	mental	and	spiritual	wholes.

Intellectual	 logic	 deals	 with	 “parts;”	 holistic	 logic	 with	 “wholes.”	 All
intellectually	 logical	 propositions,	 as	 Bertrand	 Russell	 says,	 are	 essentially
tautologies.	 They	 equate	 judgments	 concerning	 the	 realm	 of	 “parts.”	 They	 see
that	 parts	 fit	 well	 causally,	 one	 with	 the	 others.	 They	 are	 strictly	 analytical
propositions	 and	 are	 perfectly	 adapted	 to	 the	 mechanistic	 conception	 of	 the
world—which	will	always	remain	an	essential	factor	in	human	knowledge.	This
concept,	so	strongly	(almost	exclusively)	developed	in	the	European	civilization
(and	its	Greek	prototypes),	is	a	marvelous	instrument	of	knowledge.	But	only	an
instrument.	It	does	not	make	us	understand	reality.	It	only	establishes	a	basis	of
“intellectual	 honesty”	 for	 our	 approach	 to	 reality.	 It	 helps	 remove	 the	 parasitic
growths	 of	 subjective	 emotionalism,	 which	 so	 easily	 corrupt	 any	 type	 of	 vital
knowledge.	It	filters	the	waters	of	knowledge,	so	to	speak;	or	in	another	sense,	it
is	a	scaffold	which	lifts	up	knowledge	to	a	really	human	plane.	Intellectual	logic
and	the	idea	of	strict	causation	(its	result)	are	marvelous	tools	for	the	training	of
a	 crystal-clear,	 honest	 and	 un-emotional	 or	 un-devotional	 mind.	 They	 serve	 to
root	out	the	delusion	of	the	miraculous,	the	fallacies	of	the	religious,	tribal	mind.
They	are	great	cathartics.	But	while	one	may	guess	at	the	shape	of	a	building	by
studying	the	scaffold	used	to	build	it—the	scaffold	is	not	the	building.

The	 scaffold	 represents	 the	 outside	 view	 of	 the	 world,	 a	 view	 which	 deals
with	 parts	 as	 if	 they	 were	 not	 integral	 components	 and,	 in	 a	 sense	 at	 least,
products	 of	 the	 whole.	 But	 the	 moment	 the	 whole	 becomes	 an	 operating	 unit,
parts	 cease	 to	 be	 merely	 parts;	 they	 become	 functional	 organs	 of	 the	 organic
whole.	We	usually	restrict	the	use	of	such	terms	as	organism,	organs,	functions
to	 what	 is	 now	 known	 in	 science	 as	 biological	 wholes.	 But	 in	 the	 holistic
conception	of	the	universe	we	extend	the	use	of	the	terms,	potentially	at	least,	to
all	kinds	of	wholes.	The	fact	that	there	is	a	whole	implies	the	existence	of	parts
which	 are	 more	 than	 what	 is	 known,	 from	 the	 mechanistic	 viewpoint,	 as	 mere
parts.	Again	we	may	make	a	distinction	between	mechanistic	and	intellectually
analyzed	parts,	and	holistic	parts;	the	latter	being	in	all	respects	organs,	cells	or
groups	of	cells,	and	agents	of	the	whole.

Elsewhere	 we	 spoke	 at	 great	 length	 of	 the	 philosophy	 of	 Operative
Wholeness	(The	Glass	Hive,	Hamsa	series	of	articles	bearing	this	title;	1929	to
1934).	 We	 feel	 that	 these	 two	 words	 “Operative	 Wholeness,”	 which	 we	 used
years	 before	 being	 acquainted	 with	 General	 Smuts’	 work	 or	 those	 of	 other
English	philosophers,	are	very	significant.	They	at	any	rate	give	the	keynote	of	a

philosophy	of	astrology.	For	true	astrology	deals,	exclusively	and	integrally,	with
operative	 wholes.	 It	 deals	 with	 them	 just	 at	 the	 precise	 moment	 when	 they
emerge	 into	 the	 condition	 of	 wholes;	 when	 they	 become	 able	 to	 maintain
independent	operation	as	wholes	at	their	own	level	of	being;	able	also,	at	least
potentially,	 to	 reproduce	 themselves	 through	 some	 sort	 of	 emanative	 or
multiplicative	process.

Here	 we	 are	 confronted	 with	 two	 definite	 factors:	 a	 space	 factor	 —the
structure	 of	 the	 whole,	 its	 morphology	 and	 the	 sum	 total	 of	 its	 specific
characters;	and	a	time	factor—the	moment	of	integration,	of	“holization,”	when
what	was	only	a	group	of	elements	begins	to	operate	as	an	independent	whole.
The	space	factor	has	to	be	known	independently	of	astrology.	It	belongs	to	those
sciences	 which	 deal	 with	 spatial	 arrangement	 or	 structure,—as	 physics,
physiology	 and	 psychology.	 An	 astrological	 chart	 will	 never	 tell,	 of	 itself,
whether	the	whole	it	characterizes	is	a	man,	a	dog,	a	seed	of	wheat,	or	an	idea.	If
one	 knows	 that	 the	 chart	 is	 to	 be	 referred	 to	 an	 entity	 of	 the	 species	 homo
sapiens,	 and	 moreover	 to	 a	 particular	 race	 within	 that	 species	 (white,	 yellow,
black,	 red),	 then	 a	 good	 deal	 of	 inferential	 knowledge	 may	 be	 had	 as	 to	 the
individual	variation	of	the	type	which	the	chart	represents;	nothing	more.

This	is	one	of	the	reasons	why	we	compared	astrology	to	pure	mathematics;
for	mathematics	does	not	give	any	information	as	to	what	its	equations	refer	to.
First,	 you	 have	 to	 have	 perceptual	 knowledge;	 then	 only	 can	 you	 use
mathematics	 to	 give	 a	 new	 quality	 to	 that	 knowledge.	 Likewise	 in	 order
intelligently	 to	 use	 astrology,	 you	 have	 first	 to	 know	 what	 kind	 of	 whole	 the
chart	 symbolizes.	 Is	 it	 a	 human	 being?	 Is	 it	 a	 man	 or	 a	 woman?	 And,	 to	 some
extent	 at	 least,	 what	 racial	 and	 cultural	 type	 of	 man	 or	 woman	 is	 it?	 Knowing
these	things,	astrology	can	then	be	used	to	add	a	new	quality	to	that	knowledge.
This	quality	is	almost	solely	dependent	upon	values	which	refer	to	the	essence	of
time	—an	almost	entirely	unknown	factor	in	science.	Astrology	is	rooted	in	the
mystery	of	time.

Again	let	us	restate	our	parallelism	between	logic	and	astrology.	Logic	is	a
method	 of	 testing	 the	 purity	 of	 the	 causal	 principle	 in	 any	 concept.	 The	 causal
principle	 in	 turn	 is	 the	 foundation	 of	 the	 mechanistic	 theory,	 which	 refers,	 as
seen	 above,	 to	 an	 external	 viewpoint	 from	 which	 the	 universe	 appears	 as	 a
grouping	of	causally	related	elements	in	an	abstract	matrix	which	now	is	called
space-time,	or	the	continuum.	In	such	a	theory	the	essence	of	space	completely
absorbs	the	reality	of	time,	which	becomes	merely	a	fourth-dimension	of	space.
As	Bergson	pointed	out	in	his	great	work	Creative	Evolution,	the	time	of	science

is	purely	mathematical	and	has	no	intrinsic	vital	value.	He	then	tried	to	approach
the	reality	of	time,	which	he	expressed	by	the	term	“duration.”

### Time	and	Cycles

In	 the	 holistic	 universe	 (generally	 speaking,	 and	 not	 necessarily	 as	 General
Smuts	 sees	 it)	 time	 is	 very	 real	 indeed.	 And	 its	 reality	 is	 very	 much	 to	 be
identified	 with	 the	 reality	 of	 the	 wholeness	 of	 the	 wholes.	 Not	 only	 does	 real
time,	or	Bergsonian	duration,	become	a	function	of	the	wholeness	of	wholes,	but
it	 enters,	 in	 a	 sort	 of	 meta-causal	 way,	 into	 the	 “holization”	 of	 any	 group	 of
elements.	Two	factors	are	thus	involved:	First,	the	span	of	independent	existence
of	any	whole	is	intimately	united	to	the	character	of	the	wholeness	of	that	whole.
Second,	the	quality	of	the	moment	when	the	group	became	an	operative	whole
determines	the	quality	of	the	wholeness	of	the	whole.

In	other	words,	whether	a	whole	continues	to	exist	as	such	a	minute,	a	year
or	 a	 billion	 years,	 is	 not	 merely	 a	 secondary	 matter.	 The	 span	 of	 wholeness
cannot	be	isolated	from	the	essence	of	the	whole.	The	relation	between	both	is
not	one	of	causation,	but	one	of	identity.	Considered	as	a	particular,	living	entity,
a	 man	 is	 the	 length	 of	 his	 life:	 first	 proposition.	 A	 man	 is	 the	 moment	 of	 his
assumption	 of	 the	 power	 of	 independent	 existence	 (first	 breath):	 second
proposition.	Such	are	postulates	of	a	“time-philosophy.”

Nevertheless	 these	 do	 not	 contradict	 the	 facts	 that	 a	 man	 is	 first	 of	 all	 an
entity	belonging	to	the	human	species,	then	to	a	particular	race	and	physiological
grouping.	 These	 facts	 determine	 a	 man’s	 space-characteristics:	 his	 biological
structure.	But	a	man	is	not	only	a	part	of	a	collectivity	(mechanistic	view).	He	is
an	individual	whole	(holistic	view).	What	is	it	that	characterizes	this	individual
wholeness?	The	moment	of	his	first	breath,	and	the	span	of	his	life—both	being
related	values	in	real	time.

Modern	 science	 has	 nothing	 whatsoever	 to	 say	 as	 to	 the	 quality	 of	 the
wholeness	of	any	whole;	nor	has	it	anything	vital	and	real	to	say	concerning	the
essence	 of	 time.	 Wholes	 are	 creatures	 of	 time.	 Parts,	 as	 causally	 related
elements,	 are	 creatures	 of	 space.	 The	 term	 “creatures”	 may	 be	 somewhat
allegorical;	but	the	general	idea	is	correct,	for	the	relationship	of	time	to	wholes
is	of	a	genetic	type.	It	is	not	exactly	that	time	makes	wholes;	but	time	conditions
the	 making	 of	 wholes.	 To	 return	 to	 our	 previous	 illustration,	 mathematics	 does
not	 make	 physics,	 but	 mathematics	 conditions	 the	 making	 of	 physics.
Mathematics	makes	physics	a	whole,	through	the	process	of	logical	correlation

of	 data.	 Likewise	 time	 makes	 of	 groupings	 of	 elements	 operative	 wholes,
through	 a	 process	 of	 correlation	 and	 “holization”	 of	 these	 elements.	 This	 latter
process	 is	 not	 logical.	 In	 some	 cases	 we	 may	 call	 it	 biological;	 but	 in	 a	 more
general	 sense	 it	 transcends	 what	 is	 ordinarily	 called	 “life.”	 It	 might	 be	 named
cyclological,	because	time	is	essentially	cyclic	in	its	manifestations.

Thus	the	science	of	 cycles	(or,	more	 accurately,	 the	science	of	 “cyclicity”).
Cyclology	 is	 to	 the	 science	 of	 wholes	 what	 mathematics	 is	 to	 modern	 physical
science.	 Mathematics	 analyzes	 space;	 cyclology	 analyzes	 time—real	 time,	 the
time	 of	 the	 living	 and	 the	 whole.	 The	 former	 starts	 from	 a	 strictly	 causal,
intellectual,	 external	 (in	 General	 Smuts’	 sense	 of	 the	 term)	 viewpoint	 of	 the
universe,	 conceived	 as	 extended	in	an	 abstract	space-time	continuum,	in	which
time	 is	 interpreted	 as	 an	 extra	 spatial	 coordinate.	 The	 latter	 starts	 from	 a
synchronistic,	holistic,	internal	view	of	the	universe	conceived	as	in-tensed	in	a
cyclic	psycho-biological	time,	the	unit	of	which	might	be	called	the	“quantum	of
duration,”	 viz.,	 the	 creative	 moment.	 The	 moment	 is	 creative	 inasmuch	 as	 it
releases	 the	 power	 needed	 to	 make	 wholes.	 It	 is	 a	 sort	 of	 “photon,”	 as	 it
represents	a	unit	of	release	of	that	whole-making	energy	which	is	the	innermost
reality	of	time.

If	we	refer	again	to	General	Smuts’	ideas	and	see	with	him	the	wholeness	of
the	whole	as	identical	with	self	or	soul	(depending	on	these	words’	definitions),
then	we	can	realize	that	the	moment	is	creative	of	selfhood	or	soul;	that	a	soul
can	be	determined	in	function	of	the	moment	at	which	the	whole,	of	which	it	is
the	 very	 wholeness,	 arises	 as	 an	 independently	 operating	 individuality.	 Time
becomes	 thus	 the	 universal	 matrix	 of	 “individual	 souls.”	 Each	 soul	 (or	 whole)
has	 its	 birth-moment	 and	 its	 cycle	 of	 manifestation,	 both	 of	 which	 fully
determine	it	as	a	soul,—i.e.,	as	a	wholeness	of	parts,	which,	in	their	ancestry	as
parts,	refer	to	space.

This	fits	in	well	with	the	old	mythological	symbolism.	For	Chronos-Saturn	is
the	 maker	 of	 individual	 souls,	 or	 individual	 selves,	 or	 personalities,	 or	 egos—
according	to	the	way	these	terms	are	defined.	It	is	the	god	of	cycles,	the	ruler	of
the	 Golden	 Age	 (i.e.,	 of	 the	 beginning	 of	 any	 cycle).	 It	 is	 the	 principle	 of
limitation,	of	boundaries,	of	finiteness,	of	crystallization	and	form.	This,	because
every	whole	must	needs	be	finite;	because	wholeness	implies	finiteness,	selfhood
implies	 limitations	 and	 form.	 Yet	 the	 Golden	 Age	 is	 the	 age	 of	 innocence	 and
bliss;	 for	 to	 live	 wholly	 within	 the	 limits	 and	 cyclic	 boundaries	 of	 one’s	 own
wholeness	 is	 true	 innocence	 and	 bliss;	 sin	 and	 tragedy	 coming	 only	 as	 one
attempts	to	go	beyond	these	boundaries	in	search	of	the	“infinite.”

### In	one	of	his	letters	to	students,	Marc	Jones	writes:

“There	is	no	delusion	so	damaging	to	the	spiritual	growth	of	the	seeker	as
the	idea	that	infinity	is	something	to	be	sought,	and	somehow	to	be	gained.	.
.	.	Infinity	is	a	concept	of	finite	mind,	to	get	at	something	which	it	is	not,
and	 finiteness	 is	 a	 necessity	 for	 realization	 of	 infinity,	 paradoxical	 as	 this
may	seem	to	be.	.	.	.	Fear	is	infinite,	just	as	love	is	finite.	Hate	is	infinite,	as
is	 a	 lie	 or	a	 surrender	of	 a	soul	 to	the	 immoral	or	 the	base;	 but	 divinity	is
finite,	 definite,	 that	 is.	 Finite	 means	 limited,	 infinite	 indicates	 a	 lack	 of
delimitation.	The	utterly	unlimited	is	wholly	unknown,	the	whole	defined	is
the	absolutely	known.	God	was	finite	to	Jesus:	his	‘father.’	Divinity	is	finite
to	 the	 student	 who	 knows	 through	 the	 spiritual	 bounding,	 the	 initiatory
limiting	of	his	being.	Paul	calls	himself	a	‘slave’	of	an	immortal	master,	and
in	 this	 ‘bondservantship’	 becomes	 likewise	 a	 real	 or	 immortal	 personality.
Reality	is	finite,	never	infinitely	gained.	The	quest	for	the	real	is	really	the
quest	for	the	finite	absolute.”

This	easily	brings	us	back	to	the	revolution	which	Einstein	accomplished	in
the	 realm	 of	 world	 physics	 by	 declaring	 the	 universe	 boundless	 but	 limited.
Since	 this	 mathematical	 statement	 modern	 science	 has	 begun	 to	 deal	 with	 the
universe	 as	 a	 whole—and	 also	 with	 the	 atom	 as	 a	 whole	 composed	 of	 very
peculiar	 parts.	 All	 of	 which	 leads	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 Holism.	 But	 we	 would
seriously	 question	 some	 of	 the	 philosophical	 ideas	 involved	 in	 Einstein’s
generalized	theory.	We	would,	for	instance,	say	that	space	as	such	is	unlimited;
because	 space	 deals	 with	 the	 causal	 extension	 of	 elements,	 of	 parts-to-be.	 And
there	is	no	limit	to	the	possible	number	of	and	relations	between	elements.	But
time	 is	 limited;	 because	 it	 is	 the	 realm	 of	 wholemaking;	 and	 wholeness	 or
selfhood	 is,	 by	 definition,	 limited.	 Time,	 abstractly	 speaking,	 is	 the	 Cycle—
whatever	 the	 apparent	 size	 of	 it	 may	 be.	 It	 is	 the	 “circle	 of	 wholeness”;	 the
mythological-astronomical	Ring	of	Saturn.	That,	therefore,	which	makes	space-
time	 limited	 is	 the	 factor	 of	 time.	 Infinite	 time	 is	 an	 absurdity.	 Eternity	 is	 not
infinite	time,	but	an	immense	cycle	of	time,	or	eon.	Mystically	speaking,	it	is	the
wholeness	of	any	cycle.

In	 Gnostic	 philosophy	 an	 Eon	 is	 not	 only	 a	 cycle	 of	 time,	 but	 a	 divine
Consciousness	or	cosmic	Being—a	cosmic	Whole.	This	applies	to	every	cycle,
however	small	it	may	appear	to	be.	A	moment	is	an	eon,	in	the	sense	that	it	is
both	a	unit	of	time	and	a	soul—or	the	formative	matrix	of	a	number	of	wholes

that	achieve	then	their	wholeness.	As	to	what	is	called	the	“universal	Self,”	such
does	 not	 mean	 an	 infinite	 Self,	 but	 on	 the	 contrary	 that	 which	 reaches	 perfect
selfhood	 during	 every	 “quantum	 of	 duration,”	 during	 every	 moment:	 viz.,	 the
whole	that	is	whole	in	and	through	every	one	of	the	shortest	moments,	without
any	 conceivable	 break	 in	 selfhood.	 It	 may	 be	 the	 smallest	 of	 the	 small,	 or	 the
vastest	of	the	vast.	Dimensions	do	not	count,	because	they	belong	to	the	realm	of
space.	Nor	does	it	matter	whether	a	whole	has	this	or	that	number	of	parts,	small
or	 tremendously	 large.	 The	 number	 of	 parts	 and	 the	 degree	 of	 extension	 in
dimensions	do	not	belong	to	the	realm	of	wholeness—or	time,	but	to	the	illusion
of	spatiality,	 the	 illusion	of	plus	 and	 minus,	of	 intellectual	 logic	 and	 causation.
Being	is	potentially	whole	at	every	moment.	The	supreme	Being	is	He	Who	is
actually	 whole	 at	 every	 moment,	 knowing	 not	 the	 disintegration	 that	 is	 death;
Whose	 span	 of	 time	 is	 so	 full	 with	 uninterrupted	 wholeness	 that	 it	 is	 both	 the
smallest	of	the	small	and	the	vastest	of	the	vast.

### Positive	and	Negative	Time

All	of	which	is	undoubtedly	very	metaphysical;	yet	so	intensely	practical!	It
refers	to	one	of	the	basic	changes	which	characterize	this	period	of	transition	of
ours;	a	change	very	complex	inasmuch	as	it	at	times	appears	to	be	directed	one
way,	at	others	just	in	the	opposite	direction.	Since	the	sixth	century	B.C.	mankind
has	 tried	 to	 repolarize	 itself	 in	 accordance	 with	 a	 new	 mental	 and	 abstract
viewpoint.	Its	best	philosophers	and	scientists	have	stressed	the	factor	of	“form.”
Form,	which	must	not	be	confused	with	“body,”	is	merely	the	synthetic	result	of
purely	 abstract	 relationship.	 Form,	 however,	 when	 it	 becomes	 manifest	 in	 the
ordering	 of	 material	 elements	 into	 a	 “body”	 (or	 object),	 implies	 extension	 in
space.	 Thus	 space,	 as	 a	 cosmic	 principle,	 has	 been	 fundamentally	 emphasized
during	these	last	twenty-five	centuries.

On	 the	 other	 hand,	 real	 time	 has	 been	 left	 in	 the	 background.	 Time,	 for
archaic	 mankind,	 meant	 a	 line	 of	 successive	 modifications	 undergone	 by
material	 bodies.	 Time	 was	 significant	 insofar	 as	 it	 seemed	 to	 cause	 the	 fateful
disintegration	of	bodies	and	energies.	Time	was	thus	analogical	with	fate.	Saturn
was	 the	 god	 of	 fate	 and	 karma—the	 implacable	 ruler	 whose	 decrees	 meant
cessation	 and	 death.	 Cessation	 means	 emotion;	 and	 so	 does	 birth.	 All	 great
changes,	 all	 moments	 when	 time	 seems	 to	 act	 with	 particular	 power	 and
significance,	 are	 causes	 for	 intense	 emotions.	 Thus	 time-values	 appear,	 to	 the
“natural”	 man,	 as	 emotional	 values.	 Time	 (Saturn)	 operates—as	 we	 shall	 see
later	on—through	changes	in	feelings	(Moon).	The	changes	of	the	Moon	mould

the	life	of	feelings	of	man,	as	the	solar	changes	affect	the	operation	of	the	basic
life-force	in	all	living	bodies.

Time,	thus	connected	with	change,	carries	always	with	it	the	significance	of
cessation	 (cf.	 the	 Saturn	 symbolism);	 and	 thus	 that	 of	 the	 tragic	 inability	 to
perpetuate	 consciousness,	 love,	 youth	 and	 all	 such	 symbols	 of	 perfectly
functioning	 organic	 form.	 In	 other	 words,	 time,	 which	 at	 first	 was	 associated
with	 the	 birth	 of	 things	 (Golden	 Age)	 and	 bliss,	 for	 many	 centuries	 seems	 to
have	been	essentially	linked	with	the	idea	of	death	and	the	fatality	of	not	being
able	 to	 maintain	 one’s	 own	 identity	 (which	 means,	 to	 retain	 a	 definite	 form).
Saturn-time	 has	 been	 regarded	 thus	 more	 and	 more	 (especially	 throughout	 the
Christian	era)	as	the	power	that	opposes	life;	an	anti-holistic	power.

This	in	itself	is	highly	significant.	That	which	actually	generates	wholes	and
gives	 birth	 to	 souls	 has	 been	 almost	 exclusively	 considered	 as	 the	 cause	 of	 all
destruction!	It	is,	of	course,	both	the	cause	of	birth	and	the	cause	of	death.	But
because	 “this	 world”	 was	 considered	 evil	 and	 illusory,	 birth	 did	 not	 seem	 a
particularly	 joyful	 event—and,	 curiously	 enough,	 death	 was	 even	 more	 feared;
which	 would	 be	 indeed	 quite	 illogical,	 were	 it	 not	 for	 the	 fact	 that	 death	 was
taught	 to	 mean	 in	 so	 many	 cases	 the	 birth	 of	 hell!	 Occult	 philosophy	 and	 the
deeper	types	of	mysticism	emphasized	the	teaching	that	while	the	ordinary	man,
identifying	his	selfhood	with	his	body	of	earth-matter,	was	facing	extinction	of
personal	consciousness	at	death,	the	adept,	having	succeeded	in	transferring	his
selfhood	 from	 the	 body	 to	 the	 abstract	 form	 (or	 astral	 prototype),	 knew	 no
cessation	of	personality	at	death.	His	material	body	would	disintegrate	under	the
sway	of	Saturn,	but	having	established	his	selfhood	in	an	abstract	form,	he	was
able	 to	 cheat	 Saturn.	 He	 remained	 the	 same	 self	 minus	 a	 material	 vehicle	 for
expression.	 The	 wholeness	 of	 the	 whole	 remained,	 even	 though	 the	 operative
power	of	the	whole	(in	terms	of	earthly	activity)	was	gone.

Thus	 the	 fatality	 of	 cessation	 was	 overcome,	 through	 the	 mastery	 of	 form.
Man	 building	 his	 “form	 of	 immortality,”	 or	 extricating	 it	 from	 the	 substantial
elements	 which	 gave	 it	 body,	 was	 able	 to	 retain	 his	 selfhood	 in	 spite	 of	 all
changes,	in	spite	of	time.	Having	built	his	own	space-structure	as	an	impregnable
fortress,	he	could	defy	time.	This	could	be	done	only	by	the	use	of	mind.	Various
levels	of	mind	would	confer	upon	one	various	types	of	immortality.	A	great	book
remembered	throughout	the	ages	is	a	sort	of	personal	immortality	for	its	author.
The	adept,	however,	was	able	to	gain	an	even	more	integral	type	of	immortality
by	 functioning	 beyond	 death	 in	 his	 “Christ-body”	 or	 “body	 of	 resurrection”	 or
nirmanakaya	body,	etc.

Unfortunately,	the	creative	type	of	mind	(i.e.,	mind	considered	in	relation	to
the	 process	 of	 whole-making)	 was	 soon	 obscured	 by
tremendous
development	 of	 the	 logical	 type	 of	 mind,	 or	 analytical	 intellect.	 Through
analysis,	space	lost	its	wholeness	(i.e.,	its	connection	with	the	holistic	power	of
time)	 and	 became	 mechanistic	 and	 strictly	 causal.	 It	 became	 infinite,	 thus
meaningless.	It	was	conceived	as	extending	in	all	directions	infinitely.	Causality
and	mechanism	led	to	the	formulation	of	the	laws	of	thermo-dynamics	and	to	the
idea	of	entropy.	The	universe	was	seen	as	“running	down.”	Here	also	time	was
becoming	 the	 fatality	 of	 cessation—instead	 of	 the	 power	 of	 giving	 birth	 to
wholes.

### the

Of	late,	however,	a	tendency	toward	restating	cosmology	in	terms	not	unlike
the	 ancient	 Days	 and	 Nights	 of	 Brahma	 has	 come	 to	 the	 fore.	 Not	 only	 is	 the
universe	 being	 conceived	 as	 a	 whole,	 but	 instead	 of	 being	 pictured	 as	 an
exploding	 whole	 it	 is	 acquiring	 the	 power	 to	 regenerate	 itself,	 periods	 of
contractions	 alternating	with	 periods	of	 expansion	(Sir	 James	Jeans;	op.	 cit.,	 p.
138).	 It	 seems	 probable	 that	 a	 new	 understanding	 of	 the	 essence	 of	 time	 may
lead	scientists	to	further	and	more	satisfactory	theories.

The	 main	 point	 for	 us	 to	 grasp,	 however,	 is	 that	 there	 are	 two	 fundamental
conceptions	of	time	possible:	Negative	time	is	time	conceived	as	the	fatality	of
cessation.	Positive	time,	or	holistic	time,	is	the	power	of	whole-making.	The	first
view	is	subjective	 and	 emotional.	 It	 says:	“Here	 I	am,	 whole,	alive,	conscious;
and	 it	 is	 all	 going	 to	 end!	 Each	 change	 is	 a	 step	 toward	 death,	 and	 thus	 all	 is
suffering	 and	 all	 in	 vain.”	 Thus	 speaks	 the	 individual,	 who	 has	 seen	 that
individual	selfhood	is	a	mirage.	“All	compound	entities	decay,”	said	the	Buddha.
From	which	follows	logically	that	the	only	wise	attitude	to	take	is	to	withdraw
one’s	consciousness	from	all	changing	compounds	and	to	dwell	in	pure	“abstract
form,”	 in	 pure	 wholeness	 beyond	 (or	 within)	 all	 wholes.	 This	 is	 the	 Nirvana
state.

### in

The	 positive	 conception	of	 time	sees	 time	as	 the	eternal	birthing	 of	wholes
which	do	not	necessarily	die	as	such	but	may	keep	combining	with	each	other,
forming
the	 process	 ever	 greater	 wholes.	 Through	 participation	 in
consciousness	the	individual	may	become	an	organic	part	of	a	greater	whole,	and
thus	 achieve	 immortality	 within	 that	 whole,	 as	 a	 functional	 agent	 of	 the
wholeness	 of	 the	 greater	 whole.	 This	 kind	 of	 immortality	 differs	 in	 meaning
from	strictly	personal	immortality,	because	it	is	not	based	on	the	overcoming	of
time,	but	on	identification	with	the	creative	power	of	every	moment.

Man	should	live	fully	every	moment,	and	first	of	all	his	fundamental	birth-
moment	and	his	entire	Destiny.	As	he	ceases	resisting	time,	but	on	the	contrary
accepts	the	creative	message	of	every	moment,	every	moment	is	seen	as	a	birth.
Man,	as	he	lives	creatively,	lives	in	a	constant	process	of	whole-making.	He	is
not	trying	to	escape	the	limitations	of	any	one	moment	by	rushing	off	into	space,
but	 he	 fulfills	 the	 space	 and	 the	 form	 determined	 by	 the	 potency	 of	 every
moment;	and	by	so	doing	he	constantly	renews	his	wholeness.	He	creates,	with
the	 same	 ease	 and	 joy,	 in	 the	 moments	 which	 define	 his	 wholeness	 as	 that	 of
youth	as	in	those	other	moments	which	define	his	wholeness	as	that	of	maturity,
old	age,	or	death.	All	these	time-definings	are	equally	creative	opportunities	for
whole-making.	At	every	moment	he	is	a	whole	combining	with	all	other	wholes
within	the	universal	Whole.	When	the	space-structure	known	as	his	body	is	no
longer	able	to	define	new	series	of	whole-making,	the	structure	is	resolved	into
its	elements,	which	recombine	within	the	Whole	to	carry	on	the	joy	of	birthing	in
other	modes.	But	at	the	very	moment	the	body	structure	loses	its	holistic	power
and	 breaks	 down,	 in	 that	 same	 moment	 myriads	 of	 structures	 are	 born	 in	 the
universe.	 A	 star	 may	 be	 born,	 and	 he	 who	 has	 fulfilled	 time	 and	 identified
himself	with	its	cyclic	tides	is	carried	thereon	to	immediate	birthing	according	to
the	fulness	of	the	whole-making	power	he	had	developed	within	his	then	ending
space-structure	(i.e.,	species,	race,	family	and	groupings	of	all	sorts).

### Intuitions	and	Symbols

The	new	type	of	Astrology,	which	we	discuss	in	this	book,	is	founded	upon
this	 positive	 conception	 of	 time.	 And	 it	 involves	 therefore	 the	 use	 of	 a	 faculty
which	had	no	place	in	minds	weighed	down	by	the	negative	concept	of	time,	its
determinism	 and	 its	 fears.	 According	 to	 the	 negative	 concept	 of	 time,	 every
whole	is	dying	at	every	moment	in	its	parts.	Thus	the	only	thing	the	whole	can
do	 is	 try	 frantically	 to	 get	 new	 parts,	 and	 so	 master	 the	 causal	 laws	 of
relationship	 between	 parts	 that,	 by	 engineering	 skill,	 the	 fateful	 disintegration
may	be	made	as	slow	as	possible,	and	the	space-structure	may	be	preserved.	As
in	 war	 offensive	 is	 the	 best	 means	 of	 defense,	 so	 self-preservation	 is	 best
accomplished	by	means	of	self-aggrandizement.	Which	leads	to	imperialism	and
greed,	on	a	constant	background	of	fear.	At	the	limit	we	have	the	symbol	of	the
“black	 magician,”	 who	 feeds	 on	 the	 death	 of	 all	 things,	 who	 in	 absolute	 fear
preserves	 his	 formal	 perfection	 by	 destroying	 all	 things	 and	 sucking	 their	 life-
power.	Such	is	the	supreme	manifestation	of	negative	time.	It	involves	the	use	of
a	powerful	intellect,	which	reduces	all	things	to	elements	in	order	to	assimilate

them,	 which	 is	 absolutely	 un-creative	 because	 absolutely	 divorced	 from	 the
holistic	power	of	true	time.

This	 is	 perhaps	 only	 a	 symbol,	 but	 it	 indicates	 the	 consummation	 of	 the
process	which	extols	exclusively	intellectual	logic,	and	the	analytical,	causalistic
attitude	of	the	mind.	In	opposition	to	this	we	see	the	development	of	the	faculty
of	intuition,	which	is	the	power	to	identify	oneself	with	the	whole-making	power
of	 time.	 Intuition	 begins	 with	 biological	 instinct.*	 The	 latter	 apprehends	 every
new	situation	and	confrontation	as	a	whole,	and	reacts	to	it	instantaneously	also
as	 a	 whole.	 Thus	 there	 is	 perfect	 adjustment	 of	 whole	 to	 whole,	 and	 perfect
fulfillment	 both	 of	 all	 relationships	 involved	 in	 the	 confrontation	 and	 of	 the
moment	itself.

### Intuition	is	the	same	power	at	the	psycho-mental	level.	C.	G.	Jung	speaks	of

### intuition	as	follows:

“Intuition	is	a	kind	of	instinctive	apprehension,	irrespective	of	the	nature
of	 its	 contents.	 .	 .	 .	 Through	 intuition	 any	 one	 content	 is	 presented	 as	 a
complete	 whole.	 .	 .	 .	 Intuitive	 cognition	 possesses	 an	 intrinsic	 nature	 of
certainty	 and	 conviction	 which	 enabled	 Spinoza	 to	 uphold	 the	 ‘scientia
intuitiva’	as	the	highest	form	of	cognition.”

The	best	definition	would	seem	to	us	to	be	that	intuition	is	holistic	perception.	It
can	also	be	defined	as	awareness	of	self.	It	is	the	faculty	which	enables	us	to	be
aware	of	the	self	(the	wholeness)	of	any	whole.	It	is	thus	opposed	to	sensations,
which	are	always	fragmentary	and	therefore	need	the	causal	logic	of	the	intellect
(or	 the	 equivalent	 biological	 power	 of	 association	 of	 sensations)	 to	 co-ordinate
them.	Intuition	is	not	based	on	causal	logic,	yet	has	a	definite	type	of	logicalness,
to	 which	 we	 referred	 as	 “holistic	 logic.”	 The	 certainty	 derived	 from	 intuitive
realizations	 is	 not	 of	 the	 same	 type	 as	 that	 derived	 from	 simple	 mathematical
propositions;	 and	 yet	 the	 intuitive	 realization	 is,	 in	 its	 own	 way,	 a	 kind	 of
tautology.

A	tautology	was	defined	by	Bertrand	Russell	as	a	proposition	showing	“that
certain	different	sets	of	symbols	are	different	ways	of	saying	the	same	thing.”	In
other	 words,	 the	 process	 is	 that	 of	 identifying	 two	 symbolical	 representations.
The	 intuitive	 realization	 is	 similar	 to	 this	 because	 through	 it	 a	 whole	 (be	 it	 an
individual	or	a	situation)	is	identified	with	a	quality.	One	knows	intuitively	that	a
man	is	honest,	let	us	say.	This	means	that	in	a	peculiar	way	the	man	and	honesty
have	been	realized	as	identical.	The	quality,	honesty,	has	superimposed	itself	to

the	 concept	 of	 the	 man,	 and	 become	 one	 with	 it.	 We	 believe	 that	 all	 intuitions
can	 be	 explained	 as	 sudden	 identifications	 of	 particular	 wholes	 with	 basic
qualities	 held,	 as	 it	 were,	 in	 the	 unconscious.	 When	 a	 person	 (or	 a	 whole
situation)	becomes	the	subject	of	an	intuitive	realization,	one	or	several	of	these
basic	qualities	are	suddenly	pulled	out	of	the	unconscious	and	so	at-one	with	the
mental	image	of	the	person	(or	the	situation)	that	the	latter	becomes	completely
significant	in	terms	of	these	qualities.*

Astrology	 is	 based	 upon	 one	 of	 these	 intuitive	 realizations	 identifying
“order”	 and	 “the	 celestial	 motions	 of	 the	 stars.”	 The	 conceptual	 quality	 of
“order”	 was	 latent	 in	 the	 unconscious.	 It	 was	 the	 psychological	 result	 of	 a
yearning	to	find	a	compensation	for	the	apparent	chaos	of	every-day	existence.
Moreover,	man	observed	that	there	was	a	striking	regularity	in	the	movements	of
Sun,	Moon,	stars.	Then	the	inner	psychological	factor	and	the	outer	perception
somehow	 appeared	 as	 identical.	 One	 became	 the	 symbol	 of	 the	 other.	 All
intuitions	are	based	on	symbols.

What	 are	 symbols?	 They	 are	 representations	 of	 qualities	 which	 pertain	 to
wholes.	In	contradistinction	to	symbols,	enumerations	 and	 categories	 pertain	 to
parts.	 Parts	 exist	 in	 a	 condition	 of	 coextensive	 simultaneity—that	 is,	 in	 space.
They	 are	 seen	 in	 juxtaposition,	 and	 they	 strike	 us	 basically	 by	 virtue	 of	 their
differences:	 they	 occupy	 different	 places,	 are	 orientated	 differently,	 behave
differently.	They	have	distinguishing	characteristics	thanks	to	which	the	mind	is
able	to	define	them	analytically	against	the	background	of	a	homogeneous	space,
or	against	each	other,	by	contrast.	Parts	therefore	can	be	enumerated;	they	can	be
given	 quantitative	 values	 and	 causal	 connections;	 they	 can	 be	 classified	 into
categories,	compartments,	etc	But	when	we	come	to	wholes	(whether	as	whole
entities,	 or	 as	 whole	 situations)	 we	 are	 facing	 truly	 indivisible	 individualities
which	 must	 be	 understood	 and	 lived	 as	 wholes.	 In	 order	 to	 do	 so	 we	 have	 to
establish	a	current	of	“sympathy”	between	ourselves	(as	a	whole)	and	them.	Our
wholeness	meets	and	at-ones	with	their	wholeness.	A	psychic	state	is	the	result,
in	 us.	 This	 state	 is	 purely	 qualitative;	 for,	 as	 Bergson	 shows	 in	 his	 book,	 Les
Données	 Immédiates	 de	la	 Conscience,*	 psychological	 states	 are	 in	 themselves
purely	qualitative,	and	pure	duration	is	a	“succession	of	qualitative	changes.”

Thus,	 briefly	 speaking	 and	 avoiding	 lengthy	 metaphysical	 arguments,	 we
may	say	that	every	whole	as	it	is	experienced	by	us	at	any	particular	moment	is
pervaded	by	a	quality	which	represents	the	“genius”	of	this	whole,	the	genius	of
the	 situation	 as	 a	 whole:	 its	 significance,	 its	 “soul.”	 How	 can	 this	 soul	 or

significance	 be	 conveyed?	 Not	 merely	 by	 an	 enumeration	 of	 the	 parts
constituting	 the	 whole,	 but	 by	 a	 “symbol”	 which,	 as	 a	 “sign,”	 reveals	 the
significance	of	the	whole.

### Time-values,	 soul-values,	 whole-values—all	 similar

terms—cannot	 be
communicated	directly.	Intellectual	analysis	and	its	related	mental	operations	are
of	no	use	whatsoever	to	convey	the	wholeness	of	a	whole,	the	genius	of	a	whole
situation,	 of	 a	 whole	 moment.	 Intuition,	 based	 on	 identification	 and	 perfect
sympathy	 (or	 perfect	 atunement),	 can	 alone	 bring	 us	 to	 the	 realization	 of	 that
wholeness	or	genius.

But	 how	 can	 we	 arouse	 this	 state	 of	 identification?	 Only	 by	 formulating	 a
situation	 or	 image	 which,	 in	 an	 actional	 dramatic	 manner,	 will	 exteriorize	 the
quality	of	the	whole,—and	moreover	will	tend	to	arouse	the	experience	of	that
quality	in	others.	Let	us	suppose	that	a	man	is	living	in	a	thick	jungle,	so	thick
that	he	has	never	seen	a	night-sky	filled	with	stars.	In	the	jungle,	he	constantly
experiences	fear	and	attacks	from	hostile	living	things.	Jungle-life	seems	to	him
an	awesome	chaos	of	brutal	instincts.	Then	a	superior	being	comes	to	him	who
takes	him	to	a	mountain	peak	from	which	he	can	watch	the	orderly	pageant	of
stars.	He	is	taught	the	rudiments	of	astronomy	and	the	ordered	laws	of	celestial
motions.	 For	 the	 first	 time	 the	 wholeness	 of	 him	 faces	 the	 wholeness	 of	 the
universe,	and	he	experiences	the	reality	of	order	and	harmony.	Even	jungle-life,
he	now	realizes,	is	ruled	by	some	vast	mysterious	harmony.

Then	he	returns	to	his	jungle,	his	whole	being	filled	with	the	experience.	He
tries	 to	 communicate	 the	 meaning	 of	 order	 to	 his	 jungle-fellows—without
success,	of	course,	as	there	is	no	sensorial	experience	of	theirs	which	can	give	to
them	the	“symbol”	of	order.	Finally,	he	leads	them	to	the	top	of	high	trees	and
they	contemplate	the	clear	night-sky.	They	see,	night	after	night,	the	pageant	of
stars.	 They	 can	 sense	 the	 reality	 of	 universal	 order,	 for	 now	 they	 have	 seen	 a
“sign”	 thereof.	 And	 whenever,	 later	 on,	 if	 unable	 to	 climb	 the	 high	 trees	 and
oppressed	 by	 the	 dark	 chaos	 of	 the	 jungle,	 they	 feel	 lost	 in	 this	 chaos,	 another
man	can	tell	them:	“Remember	the	stars.	There	is	order	in	the	world.”	And	the
despairing	men	may	again	experience	the	reality	of	order	through	the	power	of
the	symbolism	of	the	stars.

Likewise	a	tiger	becomes	a	symbol	of	fear;	a	strongly	built	house	a	symbol
of	protection.	In	other	words,	a	life-situation	which,	in	the	more	or	less	universal
experience	 of	 mankind,	 is	 spontaneously	 identifiable	 with	 the	 quality	 of	 a
particular	 psychological	 state,	 becomes	 the	 symbol	 of	 that	 state.	 It	 is	 that	 state

exteriorized	 as	 a	 symbolic	 image,	 the	 image	 being	 further	 abstracted	 at	 a	 later
stage	of	evolution	into	a	word	or	a	sentence	or	a	work	of	art.

What	makes	of	the	image	or	dramatic	action	a	fit	symbol	is,	first	of	all,	the
fact	that	it	constitutes	a	whole	situation.	It	must	be	experienced	as	a	“whole	of
action”;	 otherwise	 it	 would	 not	 release	 in	 another	 person	 a	 wholly	 determined
psychological	 state.	 Then,	 it	 must	 be	 related	 to	 the	 past	 experience	 of	 that
person,	either	directly	or	at	least	indirectly.	No	symbol	is	really	significant	to	any
one	who	has	not	experienced	the	“whole	of	action”	it	pictures.	A	tiger	is	not	a
symbol	 of	 fear	 to	 anyone	 who	 has	 never	 experienced	 a	 tiger,	 either	 directly	 or
vicariously	by	partaking	of	the	experience	of	other	persons.	The	more	vicarious
and	 remote	 the	 experience,	 the	 less	 significant	 the	 symbol—because	 the	 less
power	 it	 has	 to	 rouse	 the	 psychological	 state	 with	 which	 it	 is	 meant	 to	 be
identical.

We	said	that	all	intuitions	are	based	on	symbols.	But	so,	in	a	different	way,
are	instincts.	An	animal	faces	a	situation	and	reacts	instinctively	to	it.	If,	in	the
past,	 no	 identical	 situations	 had	 been	 experienced	 by	 his	 species	 as	 a	 whole,
there	 would	 be	 no	 such	 reaction—certainly	 not	 as	 perfect	 a	 behavior.	 The	 fact
that	 the	 situation	 had	 been	 experienced	 many	 times	 before	 made	 of	 the
configuration	 of	 elements	 constituting	 it,	 a	 symbol.	 It	 became	 a	 sign	 for	 a
psychological-biological	 state	 which	 compelled	 immediate	 adaptation.	 The
instinctive	reaction	is	not	only	immediate	but	a	perfect	adaptation	of	experiencer
to	 situation.	 This	 is	 so	 because	 the	 symbol	 has	 absolute	 significance	 and
therefore	absolutely	compels,	without	any	reservation	or	perversion,	the	proper
vital	or	biological	behavior.

In	 a	 modern	 human	 being,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 hardly	 any	 life-situation	 is	 ever
endowed	with	absolute	significance	as	a	symbol,	because	modern	man	uses	his
analytical	 mind	 to	 such	 an	 extent	 that	 he	 can	 no	 longer	 realize	 a	 situation	 (or
himself)	as	a	whole.	He	is	not	whole	in	his	reactions—unless	under	the	stress	of
a	few	all-compelling	biological	feelings.	He	does	not	see	people	or	situations	as
wholes.	 Therefore	 they	 do	 not	 become	 immediately	 identified	 by	 him	 with
“qualities,”	 of	 which	 they	 become	 symbols.	 Because	 they	 are	 not	 realized	 as
symbols	 of	 qualities,	 fully	 and	 wholly	 experienced	 in	 the	 past,	 they	 must	 be
analyzed,	bit	by	bit.	The	result	is	at	best	a	delayed	reaction;	or	a	wrong	reaction.
Neither	 instinct	 nor	 intuition	 analyzes	 a	 man	 or	 a	 situation	 bit	 by	 bit;	 but	 they
apprehend	them	whole	and	at	once.	They	see	them	whole	and	as	identified	with
one	or	several	qualities,	which	determines	a	correct	reaction.

The	 American	 Indian,	 even	 today,	 usually	 reacts	 at	 once	 to	 a	 person	 never
met	before.	This	person’s	voice	or	the	quality	of	his	silence,	or	an	indescribable
something	becomes	 for	the	Indian	a	 clear	 symbol	of	 the	person’s	real	selfhood
(i.e.,	wholeness).	And	he	acts	accordingly	with	true	judgment—on	his	intuition.
The	 white	 man,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 usually	 does	 not	 meet	 a	 stranger	 as	 whole
meeting	 whole,	 intuitively;	 but	 begins	 to	 analyze	 this	 and	 that	 feature	 or
characteristic.	 And	 seeing	 more	 or	 less	 unrelated	 parts,	 instead	 of	 a	 significant
whole	 symbol	 of	 qualities,	 he	 frequently	 reacts	 to	 the	 stranger	 in	 a	 way	 which
proves	wrong.

Intuition	is	thus	the	power	to	read	every	whole	as	a	symbol	of	a	basic	quality
of	life.	This	actually	means	to	see	the	soul	in	every	thing,	the	wholeness	(quality)
in	 every	 whole.	 Through	 his	 instincts	 the	 animal	 lives	 in	 a	 world	 of
unconsciously	 apprehended	 symbols	 which	 compels	 his	 biological	 functions	 to
react	in	perfect	patterns	of	behavior.	The	wholly	intuitive	man	lives	in	a	world	of
consciously	 perceived	 symbols,	 in	 a	 world	 of	 souls,	 full	 of	 significance.	 The
combination	 of	 all	 these	 symbols	 at	 every	 moment	 constitutes	 another	 symbol,
the	seed-symbol	of	the	moment.	This	seed-symbol	reveals	the	significant	quality
of	that	man’s	soul	as	it	sees	itself	revealed	in	the	fulfillment	of	the	moment.

Cosmically	speaking,	every	moment	of	the	universe	can	thus	be	realized	as	a
cosmic	symbol	revealing	the	quality	of	the	moment,	and	the	soul	of	the	Cosmos
—call	it	God	if	you	wish.	Every	moment	thus	realized,	however,	is	that	moment
in	relation	to	the	perceiver	on	earth;	and,	at	the	limit,	to	the	whole	of	mankind.

As	we	saw	that	each	moment	is	a	birthing	of	numberless	wholes,	it	follows
that,	 by	 law	 of	 cosmic	 inheritance,	 the	 quality	 of	 that	 moment	 determines	 the
basic	 quality	 of	 the	 wholes	 issued	 therefrom.	 And	 as	 the	 ordered	 revolution	 of
the	 celestial	 bodies	 is	 the	 great	 symbol	 of	 natural	 and	 cosmic	 order,	 it	 follows
that	the	pattern	made	by	these	celestial	bodies	at	any	moment	can	be	taken	as	the
root-symbol	of	the	wholeness	(selfhood	and	destiny)	of	every	whole	born	at	that
moment.	The	quality	revealed	by	that	root-symbol	is	the	quality	of	these	wholes.
But	the	root-symbol	(the	astrological	birth-chart)	must	be	considered	as	a	whole
and	 through	 the	 faculty	 of	 intuition.	 For	 analytical	 intellect	 is	 of	 no	 avail	 in
realizing	holistic	symbols;	and	if	the	birth-chart	means	anything	vital	and	real,	it
can	 only	 be	 as	 a	 symbol—therefore	 as	 a	 total	 configuration,	 as	 a	 whole.	 The
wholeness	of	the	celestial	pattern	at	birth	and	the	wholeness	of	the	selfhood	and
destiny	of	the	native	are	identical;	and	both	are	expressions	of	the	wholeness	of
the	moment.	In	intellectual	logic	we	have	the	formula:	If	A	=	B,	and	B	=	C,	then
A	=	C.	Holistic	logic	gives,	however,	a	different	meaning	to	the	symbol	=	than

intellectual	logic;	a	genetic	meaning,	as	it	were.

We	 must	 now	add	 that	the	 revolutions	of	 Sun,	planets	 and	 stars	 are	not	the
only	 material	 which	 may	 be	 used	 as	 symbols	 for	 an	 intuitive	 revelation	 of	 the
soul	of	the	moment.	Theoretically	everything	can	serve	as	a	basis	for	symbolism,
provided:	 1)	 that	 the	 interpreter	 is	 able	 to	 meet	 every	 symbolic	 situation	 as	 a
whole	 with	 the	 wholeness	 of	 his	 own	 selfhood,	 thus	 with	 fully	 developed
intuition;	2)	that	this	intuition,	if	it	is	to	be	communicated,	operates	according	to
the	principles	of	“holistic	logic”;	principles	which	may	be	briefly	described	as	of
functional	coherency.

This	is	where	the	intellect	finds	its	proper	place.	In	instinctive	behavior	the
“functional	 coherency”	 is	 unconscious	 and	 biological.	 For	 instance,	 certain
motions	and	attitudes	in	animal	courtship	are	symbols	of	the	biological	urge	that
leads	 to	 mating.	 But	 the	 animal	 cannot	 fail	 to	 interpret	 correctly,	 i.e.,	 with
holistic	 logic,	 the	 meaning	 of	 these	 motions	 and	 attitudes.	 His	 instinct	 knows
with	 certainty	 what	 the	 dance	 of	 the	 male	 or	 the	 flight	 of	 the	 female	 means	 in
terms	 of	 the	 biological	 function	 of	 propagation.	 His	 unconscious,	 unerring
interpretation	 is	 “functionally	 coherent”	 because	 the	 “mind”	 which	 does	 the
interpreting	is	absolutely	one	with	the	vital	principle,	with	the	wholeness	of	the
moment.	 Spring,	 as	 the	 mating	 moment,	 compels	 absolutely	 the	 animal’s
interpretation	 of	 the	 symbols	 of	 the	 dance	 of	 mating.	 The	 animal	 perfectly
fulfills	 the	 moment.	 The	 soul	 of	 the	 moment	 and	 the	 self	 of	 the	 animal	 are
identical
intepretation,	 unconscious	 and
instinctive,	cannot	be	false.

### in	 significance.	 Therefore

### the

But	 with	 man’s	 attempts	 to	 get	 an	 intuitive	 realization	 of	 his	 individual
selfhood	 and	 destiny	 at	 every	 moment,	 the	 problem	 is	 more	 complex;	 because
such	 realization	 has	 to	 find	 its	 foundation	 in	 the	 conscious	 mind.	 And	 the
conscious	mind	(or	the	thinking	function)	does	not	at	first	operate	upon	wholes
but	 upon	 parts.	 Thinking	 develops	 from	 sensations,	 which	 are	 discrete	 and
separative.	 It	 rationalizes	 sensations	 or	 associations	 of	 sensations;	 and	 unless	 a
new	faculty	re-energizes	the	mind,	it	deals	first	of	all	with	space-values	or	form-
values,	rather	than	with	positive	time-values	and	holistic	principles.	To	deal	with
the	 latter	 requires	 the	 collaboration	 of	 the	 feelings	 which,	 as	 we	 shall	 see	 in	 a
later	chapter,	react	naturally	to	whole	situations.

The	 union	 of	 the	 feelings’	 whole-reactions	 and	 of	 thought-logic	 leads	 the
mind	 to	 a	 new	 attitude	 or	 polarization.	 It	 begins	 then	 to	 function	 in	 terms	 of
wholes	rather	than	in	terms	of	parts;	in	terms	of	psychological	evaluations	rather

than	 in	 terms	 of	 physical	 intellectual	 concepts.	 It	 becomes	 holistic	 rather	 than
mechanistic.	 It	 ceases	 to	 be	 bound	 to	 material	 objects	 and	 to	 the	 task	 of
enumerating	and	classifying	them	by	their	space-characteristics.	It	turns	inward,
after	having	achieved	this	liberation,	and	begins	to	“feel”	the	living	power	of	the
moment.	 Then	 the	 wholeness	 of	 the	 moment	 begins	 to	 speak;	 and	 such
utterances	are	symbols.

It	matters	not	whether	such	symbols	are	dreams	or	mystical	visions	or	omens
or	 occult	 “signatures,”	 or	 any	 one	 of	 the	 forms	 of	 life-interpretation	 and	 even
divination	that	have	been	used	for	millennia.	The	point	is	that	all	life-encounters
become	endowed	with	significance.	Man	becomes	thus	Interpreter	and	Seer.	He
lives	in	a	world	of	souls,	in	a	world	of	significant	wholes,	because	wholeness,	or
holism,	 operates	 through	 his	 consciousness.	 In	 the	 animal,	 wholeness	 operates
through	 the	 physiological	 organism.	 In	 the	 man	 with	 a	 repolarized	 mind,
wholeness	 operates	 at	 the	 psycho-mental	 level—thus	 consciously.	 When	 the
operation	becomes	perfect,	there	is	in	the	intuitive	interpretations	of	the	symbols
of	 the	 moment	 the	 same	 certainty	 that	 exists	 in	 the	 biological	 instincts;	 a
certainty	which	the	intellect	can	know	only	in	logic	and	pure	mathematics—the
certainty	of	a	tautology;	a	certainty	that	comes	from	evident	identity.	The	animal
interprets	the	mating	dance	with	certainty	because	he	has	become	identified	with
the	 mating	 urge	 within	 the	 moment.	 Only	 he	 does	 not	 know	 it.	 The	 perfect
intuition	 is	 also	 the	 result	 of	 an	 identification	 (of	 absolute	 “sympathy,”	 as
Bergson	 wrote)	 between	 the	 perceiving	 individual	 whole	 and	 the	 perceived
whole	 situation.	 This	 identification	 occurs	 within	 the	 moment,	 to	 the	 whole-
making	energy	of	which	the	individual	is	now	fully	open.

To	 such	 a	 perfected	 intuitive	 man	 no	 particular	 system	 of	 symbolism	 is
necessary;	and	astrology	is	of	no	special	value.	But	he	cannot	communicate	his
intuitions	to	others.	Communication	necessitates	a	system	of	interpretation;	a	set
of	symbols	which	can	serve	as	spatial-mental	“bridges”	between	the	wholeness
of	the	moment	and	all	perceivers.	It	thus	needs	a	language.	Astrology	is	such	a
language,	 just	 as	 the	 series	 of	 hexagrams	 of	 the	 Chinese	 Yi	 King	 is	 such	 a
language.	 And	 it	 is	 in	 the	 formation	 and	 use	 of	 such	 a	 language	 that	 what	 we
called	 holistic	 logic	 and	 the	 principle	 of	 functional	 coherency	 come	 into
operation.

The	true	foundation	of	astrology	is	such	a	holistic	logic;	and	as	already	said,
not	 a	 compilation	 of	 data	 or	 statistics,	 even	 though	 the	 latter	 may	 have	 great
value	in	helping	to	make	abstract	interpretations	more	concrete	and	precise.	This
holistic	logic,	based	on	the	perception	of	the	wholeness	of	the	material	used	as

symbolical	elements	and	of	its	functional	coherency,	is	for	the	truly	intuitive	man
as	logical	as	intellectual	logic	But	it	is	not	as	rigid	and	set,	at	least	in	appearance,
because	it	is	creative.	It	is	a	function	of	evolving	life.	Like	the	logic	of	instincts,
it	adapts	itself	to	new	situations	and	to	new	levels	of	being.	It	is	protean—and
yet	in	a	mysterious	way	it	inheres,	unchanging	in	its	essence,	in	all	varieties	of
formulations.

### The	Foundation	of	Astrological	Symbolism

These	 unfamiliar	 thoughts	 may	 become	 clearer	 as	 we	 indicate	 briefly	 the

manner	in	which	astrological	symbolism	can	be	arrived	at.

The	problem	of	astrological	symbolism	is	that	of	correctly	(i.e.,	significantly)
identifying	the	order	manifest	in	the	cycles	of	celestial	bodies	in	relation	to	the
earth-observer,	and	the	order	which	is	usually	not	manifest	in	human	nature	and
human	 life,	 but	 for	 which	 man	 psychologically	 yearns;	 and	 which	 becomes	 an
actual	 inner	 reality	 to	 the	 spiritually	 awakened	 individual.	 The	 man	 who	 is
enmeshed	 in	 the	 continual	 warfare	 of	 primordial	 and	 natural	 elements	 finds	 in
life	 nothing	 but	 chaos	 and	 chance;	 from	 which	 results	 fear.	 The	 man	 who	 sees
these	elements	as	functional	parts	of	a	cosmic	whole,	harmonized	by	outwardly
complex,	yet	inherently	simple	laws	of	“functional	coherency,”	overcomes	fear.
Having	conceived	and	realized	the	universe	as	a	whole,	his	life	as	a	whole,	his
psyche	and	his	body	as	a	whole,	he	is	able	ultimately	to	identify	himself	with	the
wholeness	of	these	wholes;	and	to	stand	in	the	abstract	and	“mystical”	relation	of
wholeness	to	whole.	This	does	not	mean	standing	outside	of	the	whole-nature,	or
above	 it.	 It	 does	 not	 exactly	 mean	 what	 is	 ordinarily	 called	 considering	 one’s
nature	and	destiny	objectively.	It	means	retaining	a	constant	position	or	state	of
equilibrium	at	the	“center	of	gravity”	of	this	whole-nature	and	destiny.	It	means
not	being	thrown	out	of	equilibrium	by	(i.e.,	involved	into)	the	intensification	of
any	one	functional	part	of	this	whole.	It	does	not	mean	withdrawing	oneself	from
such	an	intensified	function.

Here	 it	 may	 be	 well	 to	 refer	 to	 the	 scientific	 concept	 of	 “energy”	 which	 is
determined	 in	 terms	 of	 acceleration	 of	 momentum,	 rather	 than	 in	 terms	 of	 a
mysterious	“force”	residing	in	the	object.	Psychic	energy,	likewise,	is	produced
by	the	intensification	of	a	psychic-organic	function;	by	the	fact	that	the	“quality”
it	 represents	 so	 increases	 its	 significance	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 entire	 organic
equilibrium	that	it	becomes	a	dominant	factor	in	the	consciousness.	For	instance,
the	 function	 of	 feeling	 may	 take	 such	 an	 overwhelming	 value	 that	 the
consciousness	is	almost	entirely	filled	with	a	feeling	of	hatred.	In	such	a	case	the

self,	the	“I	AM,”	becomes	usually	involved	in,	thrown	out	of	the	psychic	center
of	gravity	by	this	hatred.	And	the	whole	being	cries	out:	“I	hate,”	which	means:
“I	am	hatred.”

The	man	who	remains	equilibrated	may	feel	hatred	arise,	but	he	will	not	say:
“I	am	hatred,”	but:	“There	is	an	intensification	of	hatred	in	the	whole	of	me.”	He
will	 not	 cut	 himself	 off	 from	 the	 function	 of	 feeling,	 because	 of	 that;	 for	 this
would	be	self-mutilation.	But	he	will	marshal,	as	it	were,	all	his	other	functions
and	balance	 with	 them	 the	intensified	 feeling-function.	If	he	 succeeds	 in	 doing
this,	 he,	 the	 self	 and	 wholeness	 of	 the	 whole,	 will	 retain	 his	 position	 of
equilibrium	 at	 the	 center	 of	 gravity	 of	 his	 whole-nature.	 He	 will	 have	 thus
managed	 not	 to	 be	 swept	 away	 from	 this	 center	 of	 gravity	 by	 the	 energy
generated	by	the	intensification	(“acceleration”)	of	one	of	his	part-functions,	yet
without	withdrawing	from	this	function	and	thus	accepting	a	mutilation.

It	 is	 very	 likely	 that	 one	 cannot	 speak	 of	 “psychic	 energy”	 unless	 one	 or
more	functions	become	thus	intensified.	The	powerful	self	depends	for	its	power
upon	 such	 intensification;	 and	 thus	 his	 equilibrium	 is	 always	 unstable	 and
dynamic.	 There	 is	 a	 constant	 and	 alternating	 increase	 and	 decrease	 of	 the
intensity	of	all	functions.	Yet	the	self	remains	always	at	the	center	of	gravity	of
the	whole,	acting	upon	the	parts	whose	relationships	are	constantly	altered—but
whose	total	equilibrium	is	never	lost.

The	harmony	of	the	whole-nature	can	thus	be	pictured	in	terms	of	dynamic
relationship	 between	 parts.	 Man	 as	 a	 whole	 is	 a	 complex	 of	 dynamic
relationships	between	functional	parts.	So,	in	fact,	is	every	organic	whole.	There
is,	therefore,	in	every	organic	whole	a	dynamic	order	which	can	be	established	in
terms	of	cycles	of	alternate	intensification	and	inhibition	of	functions.	But	such	a
picture	 can	 easily	 be	 related	 to	 that	 of	 the	 solar	 system	 as	 a	 whole,	 if
intensification	 of	 function	 is	 connected	 with	 various	 sets	 of	 characteristics
derived	 from	 the	 various	 types	 of	 planetary	 relationships	 (relationships	 of
position	 in	 space,	 of	 distance	 to	 the	 Sun,	 of	 mass,	 velocity,	 stage	 of	 cosmic
evolution,	etc.).

The	 important	 point	 to	 realize	 is	 that	 these	 symbolical	 connections	 must
always	 be	 based	 upon	 an	 interpretation	 of	 the	 two	 related	 wholes	 which	 is
functionally	 coherent,	 and	 grounded	 on	 concrete	 and	 incontrovertible	 facts	 of
experience.	In	other	words,	any	correlation	established	between,	say,	Saturn	and
a	particular	psychological	function	must	derive	from	a	consistent	interpretation
of:	1)	the	solar	system	as	a	whole;	2)	the	human	psyche	as	a	whole.	If	a	principle

of	 correlation	 is	 established	 giving	 to	 one	 planet	 a	 symbolical	 significance	 in
terms	of	its	distance	to	the	Sun,	then	all	planets	must	be	given	their	respective
symbolical	significance	in	the	same	way.	If	a	strictly	geocentric	attitude	is	taken,
then	all	symbolic	interpretations	must	be	derived	from	it.	There	should	never	be
any	 mixing	 up	 of	 planes	 of	 interpretation.	 Many	 such	 planes	 of	 interpretation
may	be	used	successively,	each	in	relation	to	a	corresponding	level	of	being.	But
there	must	not	be	any	confusion	between	the	types	of	concrete	data	used	as	bases
for	the	various	sets	of	interpretation.	Each	set	of	interpretation	must	use	its	own
type	of	concrete	data,	and	this	one	exclusively.

The	following	may	be	taken	as	a	most	significant	example:	In	archaic	times
men’s	concrete	and	significant	experience	of	celestial	bodies	was	solely	in	terms
of	 the	 light	 they	 gave.	 The	 concrete	 data	 at	 the	 disposition	 of	 astrologers	 were
that	the	Sun	was	in	all	appearance	the	source	of	life	as	well	as	of	light	and	heat.
Man’s	 life	 was	 divided	 into	 periods	 with	 sun-experience	 (days)	 and	 periods
without	sun-experience	(nights).	Jungle	nights	are	full	of	fears	and	tragedies	and
deaths.	 At	 once	 life	 became	 subject	 to	 two	 interpretations,	 depending	 on	 the
presence	 or	absence	 of	 the	 Sun	 and	 of	 its	 light.	 Then,	 in	 temperate	 climates,	 it
must	have	soon	been	remarked	that	the	seasons	and	the	corresponding	changes
in	 vegetation	 and	 in	 the	 biological	 characteristics	 of	 animals	 and	 men	 were	 all
correlated	to	and	functions	of	the	various	angles	at	which	the	sun-rays	struck	the
earth,	which	angles	seemed	to	regulate	the	intensity	of	light	and	heat	as	well	as
the	even	more	obvious	relation	between	the	lengths	of	days	and	nights;	thus	the
four	basic	points	of	solar	change,	equinoxes	and	solstices.

The	 Moon	 was	 experienced	 as	 a	 mysterious	 helpmate	 of	 the	 Sun	 in	 giving
light.	 It	 was	 also	 presumably	 noticed	 very	 soon	 that	 its	 cycles	 corresponded	 to
that	of	physiological	change	in	women,	etc.	From	these	and	related	concrete	and
significant	 data	 of	 experience,	 the	 Moon	 took	 on	 a	 very	 definite	 symbolical
meaning.	 All	 the	 celestial	 bodies	 were	 seen	 as	 pin-points	 of	 light	 and	 called
“stars”;	 but	 some	 retain	 a	 constant	 relationship	 to	 each	 other	 and	 were	 called
“fixed	 stars.”	 Their	 constant	 relationships,	 i.e.,	 the	 patterns	 they	 made	 on	 the
darkness	of	space,	became	endowed	with	significance	just	because,	almost	alone
of	all	things	in	nature,	they	remained	constant.	They	therefore	became	symbols
of	 constant
life-qualities,	 of	 Ideas	 of	 organization	 or	 Archetypes—as
constellations.

The	 stars	 which,	 like	 Sun	 and	 Moon,	 changed	 their	 positions	 periodically
with	 reference	 to	 the	 constellations,	 were	 called	 “planets.”	 They	 acted	 like	 the
Sun,	with	respect	to	their	periodic	motion;	yet	they	emitted	only	a	tiny	amount	of

light.	 So	 they	 became,	 naturally	 and	 logically,	 significant	 as	 “attendants	 of	 the
Sun.”	 As	 such	 they	 were	 given	 attributes	 symbolized	 by	 the	 intensity	 of	 their
light,	 by	 the	 average	 distance	 they	 kept	 from	 the	 Sun	 and	 the	 manner	 of	 their
appearance.	 Venus,	 for	 instance,	 being	 the	 star	 of	 the	 evening	 and	 the	 star	 of
dawn	in	turn,	was	given	a	dual	significance.	From	another	standpoint	the	color
of	fixed	stars	and	planets	served	to	make	of	them	symbols	of	qualities—as	the
redness	of	Mars	and	Antares,	etc.

All	these	facts	were	concrete	and	significant	data	of	experience.	The	intuitive
man	 envisioning	 the	 skies	 as	 a	 cosmic	 whole	 distributed	 significances	 to	 their
component	parts	in	terms	of	experienced	facts.	Each	part	became	the	vehicle	of
an	 organic	 function	 within	 the	 cosmic	 whole	 of	 the	 heavens	 above	 and	 below.
All	these	experienced	facts	were	of	course	based	on	a	geocentric	interpretation
of	 the	 cosmos.	 The	 Sun	 symbolized	 the	 most	 important	 function,	 that	 of	 being
the	very	source	of	the	life-force,	not	because	it	was	the	center	of	the	solar	system
(a	notion	incongruous	to	the	geocentric	viewpoint),	but	because	it	was	the	source
of	light	and	heat,	and	the	cycle	of	life	on	earth	seemed	to	follow	exactly	its	cycle
of	 change.	 The	 Moon	 had	 then	 no	 significance	 as	 the	 satellite	 of	 the	 Earth—
because	 that	 also	 was	 entirely	 irrelevant	 in	 a	 geocentric	 system.	 Moreover,
planets	like	Uranus	and	Neptune,	not	being	visible	to	the	eye,	can	hardly	enter
into	such	a	system	based	on	actual	experience.

Nevertheless	 in	 modern	 astrology	 the	 geocentric	 and	 the	 heliocentric
viewpoints	are	hopelessly	mixed,	and	the	basis	of	symbolism	is	lost	sight	of.	The
result	 is	 utter	 philosophical	 confusion.	 Most	 of	 the	 concepts	 of	 geocentric
astrology	 are	 retained;	 Sun	 and	 Moon	 are	 called	 the	 “lights”;	 the	 term	 “fixed
stars”	is	used	for	no	valid	reason,	and	these	fixed	stars	are	given	archaic	meaning
in	terms	of	the	old	geocentric	concept	of	“constellation.”

If	 we	 wish	 to	 use	 a	 heliocentric	 basis	 for	 our	 astrological	 symbolism,	 then
many	 of	 the	 traditional	 concepts,	 phrases	 and	 denominations	 of	 ancient
geocentric	 astrology	 must	 go	 overboard.	 For	 they	 are	 illogical	 in	 terms	 of	 our
heliocentric	knowledge.	What,	however,	complicates	matters	is	of	course	that	we
do	not	experience,	actually	and	sensorially,	the	fact	that	the	Sun	is	the	center	of	a
system	of	which	the	Earth	is	but	one	planet.	At	least	most	of	us	do	not.	Scientists
who	 make	 experiments	 to	 prove	 the	 heliocentric	 system	 may	 come	 close	 to
experiencing	 it;	 but	 ordinary	 mortals	 take	 it	 for	 granted	 on	 mere	 intellectual
grounds.	Only	a	small	minority	among	men	are	far	enough	developed	mentally
to	be	said	to	experience	mentally	the	facts	of	the	heliocentric	system.*

Thus	we	find	ourselves	confronted	with	two	definite	types	of	interpretation
of	the	cosmos,	each	of	which	may	be	taken	as	a	basis	for	symbolism.	If	we	wish
to	use	both,	we	must	be	careful	to	use	them	separately,	each	one	being	made	to
correspond	to	a	distinct	level	of	human	consciousness—let	us	say,	the	vitalistic
and	the	mental	(or	ideistic,	or	abstract)	levels.	How	different	will	be	the	results
obtained	 by	 changing	 our	 basis	 of	 symbolism	 will	 readily	 be	 seen	 as	 we	 draw
logical	conclusions	(holistically	logical,	that	is)	from	the	data	deriving	from	the
heliocentric	 point	 of	 view.	 Such	 data,	 let	 us	 say	 at	 once,	 have	 very	 little	 to	 do
with	 what	 some	 people	 call	 today	 “heliocentric	 astrology.”	 By	 geocentric
viewpoint	we	do	not	mean	that	which	relates	all	celestial	motions	to	an	observer
on	Earth—for	in	every	case	we	must	obviously	do	that	very	thing.	We	mean	the
attitude	 which	 interprets	celestial	 phenomena	in	 terms	 of	 their	 actual	 sensorial
appearances.	The	heliocentric	viewpoint	is	that	of	modern	scientific	astronomy,
which	 interprets	 the	 apparent	 motions	 of	 celestial	 bodies	 according	 to	 a	 theory
proved	 by	 scientific	 experimentation—that	 is,	 according	 to	 an	 intellectual	 type
of	knowledge.

From	 the	 heliocentric	 standpoint,	 the	 solar	 system	 is	 obviously	 to	 be
considered	 as	 a	 whole,	 the	 nearest	 star	 being	 remote	 beyond	 the	 possibility	 of
belonging	to	the	systemic	whole.	In	other	words,	the	solar	system	appears	as	a
closed	unit,	the	only	known	links	between	it	and	the	outside	world	being	comets.
This	 cosmic	 whole,	 the	 solar	 system,	 is	 also	 apparently	 a	 part	 of	 some	 greater
cosmic	whole,	which	is	either	our	galaxy	the	Milky	Way,	or	a	fragment	of	this
galaxy,	or	a	group	of	such	galaxies—the	point	being	still	more	or	less	in	doubt,
on	strict	scientific	grounds	(as	far	as	we	know).	However	that	may	be,	we	have	a
somewhat	 accurate	 knowledge	 of	 the	 solar	 system	 as	 a	 physical	 unit	 (with	 the
possibility	of	yet	unknown	planets,	probably	very	remote);	and	that	knowledge
must	be	the	basis	of	our	symbolism.	No	extraneous	elements	should	be	retained,
such	as	would	follow	from	a	purely	geocentric	viewpoint.

The	 Sun,	 as	 the	 center	 of	 the	 system	 and	 the	 source	 of	 all	 the	 planets,	 is
obviously	 to	 be	 considered	 as	 the	 origin	 of	 life,	 the	 fountain-head	 of	 the	 life-
force.	 We	 “know”	 scientifically	 that	 we,	 the	 Earth	 and	 its	 inhabitants,	 revolve
around	it.	We	are	subservient	to	it,	and	its	power	(gravitational	or	otherwise)	is
the	 cause	 of	 our	 cyclic	 motion,	 following	 which	 we	 are	 compelled	 to	 see	 the
universe	 from	 a	 series	 of	 successive	 viewpoints.	 This	 series	 of	 viewpoints
constitutes	the	psychological	(or	consciousness)	reality	of	what	physical	science
calls	the	orbit	of	the	earth.	This	orbit	as	a	constant	series	of	viewpoints	is	what
we,	 in	 heliocentric	 symbolism,	 call	 the	 zodiac.	 Constellations	 are	 quite

meaningless	 in	 themselves	 in	 such	 a	 symbolism.	 They	 have	 value	 merely	 as
convenient	points	of	reference.	We	“know”	scientifically	that	they	correspond	to
nothing	 real.	 The	 distance	 of	 the	 stars	 is	 such	 that	 they	 can	 hardly	 have	 any
significance	 for	 us,	 except	 insofar	 as	 the	 galaxy	 to	 which	 our	 solar	 system
belongs	 is	 concerned.	 But	 ancient	 constellations	 have	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 our
galaxy.	 At	 best	 they	 can	 symbolize	 the	 various	 viewpoints	 which	 we	 get	 from
our	 successive	 orbital	 stations	 in	 our	 annual	 revolution	 around	 the	 Sun.	 They
symbolize,	 to	 be	 more	 accurate,	 vistas	 of	 universal	 space	 which	 the	 Earth	 and
man	experience	as	a	result	of	their	ever-changing	relationship	to	the	Sun.	They
are	symbols	of	the	space	created	by	the	revolution	of	the	Earth	around	the	Sun.

The	 planets	 of	 the	 solar	 system	 have	 significance,	 in	 the	 heliocentric
symbology,	 in	 terms	 of	 their	 relation	 of	 position,	 distance,	 mass,	 velocity,
density,	 etc.,	 to	 the	Earth	 and	the	 Sun.	 They	 are,	 first	 of	 all,	 to	 be	 divided	 into
planets	inside	and	planets	outside	of	the	Earth-orbit.	As	this	orbit	introduces,	as
far	as	we	are	concerned	of	course,	a	line	of	cleavage	between	inner	and	outer,	we
may	expect	a	sort	of	balance	or	symmetry	between	inner	and	outer	planets.	Thus
we	 pair	 Venus	 and	 Mars,	 Mercury	 and	 Jupiter	 —and,	 in	 a	 somewhat	 different
way,	 Sun	 and	 Saturn.	 It	 may	 be	 that	 there	 is	 actually	 an	 intra-Mercurial	 planet
Vulcan,	which	should	be	paired	with	Saturn;	in	which	case,	it	would	necessarily
carry	a	part	of	the	significance	now	given	to	the	Sun.	Vulcan	may	be	understood
also	as	the	Sun’s	photosphere.	For	the	photosphere	would,	in	symbolical	logic,
balance	 very	 accurately	 Saturn.	 The	 interior	 of	 the	 Sun	 would	 balance
symbolically	all	planets	which	could	be	found	outside	of	Saturn’s	orbit.

The	Moon,	as	the	only	satellite	of	the	Earth,	would	be	put	in	an	interesting
position.	 Perhaps	the	 Biblical	 symbolism	 of	 the	 creation	 of	 Eve	out	of	 Adam’s
rib	 might	 help	 us	 to	 understand	 her	 significance!	 Besides	 the	 planets,	 all	 other
symbols	used	in	astrology,	from	this	true	heliocentric	viewpoint,	have	to	be	also
interpreted	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 facts	 of	 the	 heliocentric	 theory.	 The	 Earth’s
revolution	 upon	 her	 axis	 creates	 the	 ever-changing	 horizon;	 this	 axis	 creates	 a
North	 Pole,	 a	 Pole	 Star,	 and	 other	 points	 of	 interest.	 Symbols	 combine	 with
symbols	to	give	symbols	of	“second	degree”	as	it	were—and	so	on,	theoretically
ad	infinitum.	But	 any	symbol,	 the	 significance	of	 which	 is	 not	 justified,	on	 the
grounds	of	holistic	logic,	by	the	concrete	data	it	synthetizes,	must	be	discarded
as	irrelevant.

This	 irrelevant	 quality	 has	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 statistics	 and	 tabulations	 of
cases	 which	 “prove	 or	 disprove”	 the	 significance	 of	 the	 symbol.	 It	 stands	 on	 a
logical	 basis—even	 if	 it	 is	 not	 the	 logic	 of	 intellectual	 and	 mathematical

analysis.	The	truly	intuitive	person	will	recognize	the	absoluteness	of	this	logic
on	 internal	 evidence.	 But	 few	 are	 the	 men	 who,	 at	 present,	 possess	 such	 a
perfectly	 developed	 faculty:	 the	 faculty	 of	 holistic	 perception,	 the	 power	 to
identify	 themselves	 with	 the	 wholeness	 of	 the	 wholes,	 and	 to	 release	 the
significance	 of	 these	 wholes	 in	 terms	 of	 true	 and	 compelling	 symbols.	 Great
creative	 artists,	 of	 course,	 have	 such	 a	 faculty,	 but	 developed	 only	 in	 a	 certain
direction.	 When	 the	 creative	 artist	 begins	 to	 create	 with	 life,	 then	 he	 begins	 to
live	in	a	world	of	never-ceasing	and	ubiquitous	significance,	for	he	becomes,	as
it	were,	“geared	to	the	moment.”	Then	his	utterances	become	rooted	in	universal
significance,	 the	 very	 images	 of	 the	 moment.	 They	 become	 pregnant	 with	 the
power	of	life	itself.	Such	Creative	Artists	were	Buddha,	Lao-Tze,	Jesus.

by	him	as	“sympathy.”	Intellect	at	its	highest	puts	into	our	hands	the	key	to	the	comprehension	of	matter;

limitations	 of	 mere	 instinct.	 Without	 the	 cooperation	 of	 intellect	 it	 must—as	 instinct—have	 remained

## ASTROLOGY	AND	ANALYTICAL	PSYCHOLOGY

### The	Synchronistic	Principle

In	an	address	delivered	in	Munich,	May	10th,	1930,	in	memory	of	the	great
exponent	 of	 Chinese	 wisdom	 and	 initiate	 in	 the	 psychology	 of	 Chinese	 Yoga,
Richard	Wilhelm,	C.	G.	Jung	made	these	significant	statements:*

“To	me,	the	greatest	of	Wilhelm’s	achievements	is	the	translation	of,	and
commentary	on,	the	Yi	King.	.	.	.	This	work	embodies,	as	perhaps	no	other,
the	 spirit	 of	 Chinese	 culture.	 The	 best	 minds	 of	 China	 have	 collaborated
upon	it	and	contributed	to	it	for	thousands	of	years.	Despite	its	fabulous	age,
it	 has	 never	 grown	 old,	 but	 lives	 and	 operates	 still,	 at	 least	 for	 those	 who
understand	its	meaning.	.	.	.	Anyone	like	myself	who	has	had	the	rare	good
fortune	 to	 experience	 in	 a	 spiritual	 exchange	 with	 Wilhelm	 the	 divinatory
power	 of	 the	 Yi	 King,	 cannot	 for	 long	 remain	 ignorant	 of	 the	 fact	 that	 we
have	touched	here	an	Archimedean	point	from	which	our	Western	attitude	of
mind	can	be	shaken	to	its	foundations.

“.	.	.	The	function	on	which	the	use	of	the	Yi	King	is	based,	if	I	may	so
express	 myself,	 is	 apparently	 in	 sharp	 contradiction	 to	 our	 Western,
scientifically-causal,	 Weltanschauung.	 In	 other	 words,	 it	 is	 extremely
unscientific,	 taboo	 in	 fact,	 and	 therefore	 out	 of	 reach	 of	 our	 scientific
judgment,	and	incomprehensible	to	it.

“Some	 years	 ago,	 the	 then	 president	 of	 the	 British	 Anthropological
Society	 asked	 me	 how	 I	 could	 explain	 the	 fact	 that	 so	 highly	 intellectual	 a
people	as	the	Chinese	had	produced	no	science.	I	replied	that	this	must	really
be	 an	 ‘optical	 illusion,’	 because	 the	 Chinese	 did	 have	 a	 science	 whose
‘standard	work’	was	the	Yi	King,	but	that	the	principle	of	this	science,	like	so
much	else	in	China,	was	altogether	different	from	our	scientific	principle.

### “The	science	of	the	Yi	King	is	not	based	on	the	causality	principle,	but	on

a	principle	(hitherto	unnamed	because	not	met	with	among	us)	which	I	have
tentatively	 called	 the	 synchronistic	 principle.	 My	 occupation	 with	 the
psychology	 of	 unconscious	 processes	 long	 ago	 necessitated	 my	 looking
about	 for	 another	 principle	 of	 explanation,	 because	 the	 causality	 principle
seemed	 to	 me	 inadequate	 to	 explain	 certain	 remarkable	 phenomena	 of	 the
psychology	 of	 the	 unconscious.	 Thus	 I	 found	 that	 there	 are	 psychic
parallelisms	which	cannot	be	related	to	each	other	causally,	but	which	must
be	connected	through	another	sequence	of	events.	This	connection	seemed	to
me	to	be	essentially	provided	in	the	fact	of	the	relative	simultaneity,	therefore
the	 expression	 ‘synchronistic.’	 It	 seems	 indeed,	 as	 though	 time,	 far	 from
being	 an	 abstraction,	 is	 a	 concrete	 continuum	 which	 contains	 qualities	 or
basic	conditions	manifesting	simultaneously	in	various	places	in	a	way	not	to
be	 explained	 by	 causal	 parallelisms,	 as	 for	 example,	 in	 cases	 of	 the
coincident	appearance	of	identical	thoughts,	symbols	or	psychic	conditions.
Another	 example	 would	 be	 the	 simultaneity	 of	 Chinese	 and	 European
periods	of	style,	a	fact	pointed	out	by	Wilhelm.”

This	 is	 the	 very	 expression	 of	 the	 basic	 ideas	 which	 we	 formulated	 in	 our
preceding	chapter.	Time	as	a	“concrete	continuum”	is	what	Bergson	calls	“real
duration.”	 The	 fact	 that	 it	 contains	 “qualities	 or	 basic	 conditions”	 which
exteriorize	 themselves	 in	 ideas,	 cultures	 and	 psychic	 conditions	 (individual	 or
collective)	 is	 proof	 of	 the	 generative	 power	 of	 the	 moment.	 Each	 moment	 is	 a
whole	 which	 begets	 concrete	 wholes.	 Each	 moment	 is	 to	 be	 considered,
moreover,	as	the	unit-cycle,	or	time-unit—just	as	the	quantum	or	photon	is	the
unit	 of	 release	 of	 energy.	 Energy	 is	 released	 by	 photons.	 Significance,	 or
selfhood,	is	released	by	moments.	Time	is	the	womb	of	souls;	just	as	“Light”	(in
the	most	general	sense	of	the	word)	is	the	womb	of	all	physical	energies.	As	the
Hindu	 occultist	 would	 say,	 Daivi	 prakriti	 (i.e.,	 the	 Light	 of	 the	 Logos)	 is	 the
source	of	all	energies	(or	shakti).	All	Earth-energies	can	be	traced	to	their	parent-
source,	 the	 Sun,	 whose	 total	 radiations	 are	 described	 generically	 by	 the	 term
Light.

We	 have	 thus,	 in	 a	 sense,	 a	 dualism	 of	 Light	 and	 Time,	 of	 photons	 and
moments.	 These	 two	 elements,	 to	 which	 we	 should	 add	 Space,	 are	 the
foundation	 of	 astrology,	 which	 can	 be	 based	 on	 the	 emphasis	 of	 either	 one	 of
them.	Light	and	Time	are	symbolized	by	the	photosphere	of	the	Sun	(Vulcan?)
and	Saturn,	which,	as	we	have	already	seen,	balance	each	other	on	either	side	of
the	 Earth	 in	 the	 solar	 system.	 Without	 going	 into	 lengthy	 metaphysical

discussions	 we	 may,	 however,	 state	 here	 that	 Light	 is	 the	 emanation	 of	 the
wholeness	 of	 the	 whole	 (theoretically,	 of	 any	 perfectly	 integrated	 whole—thus
the	“light”	emanated,	if	tradition	is	correct,	by	the	very	being	of	great	saints	and
mystics).	On	the	other	hand,	Time	is	the	significant	quality	of	every	whole;	that
is,	the	defining	characteristic	of	the	whole.

Every	whole	as	a	whole	theoretically	radiates	Light	(some	degree	or	type	of
it,	 not	 necessarily,	 of	 course,	 what	 we	 usually	 call	 “light,”	 and	 which	 is	 the
radiation	of	that	cosmic	whole:	the	Sun).	Every	whole	as	a	whole	represents	or
symbolizes	a	quality	which	is	the	manifestation	of	a	particular	moment	of	Time.
Time	 generates	 particulars;	 and	 every	 whole,	 as	 we	 have	 already	 seen,	 must
needs	be	defined,	limited.	It	is	thus	a	particular.	Light	is	the	manifestation	of	the
wholeness	 of	 these	 particulars.	 The	 photon	 is	 described	 by	 the	 formula	 hv,	 in
which	the	letter	v	represents	particularness	(the	particular	velocity	or	frequency
or	“key-note”	of	the	whole),	and	h	symbolizes	universality	(the	universal	fact	of
wholeness	exteriorized	as	Light;	“operative	wholeness”).*

We	might	say	that	any	cycle,	as	a	quantum	of	duration,	is	also	definable	by
the	 formula	 hv,	 in	 which	 h	 represents	 the	 universal	 potency	 of	 Time	 (i.e.,	 the
universal	 Creative	 Power,	 or	 God),	 and	 v	 the	 particular	 value	 of	 the	 cycle’s
duration.	Just	as	there	is	no	release	of	energy	except	by	whole	quanta,	so	there	is
no	 progress	 in	 selfhood	 or	 wholeness	 save	 through	 whole	 cycles.	 Selfhood
progresses	from	cycle	to	cycle,	and	only	through	the	perfect	fulfillment	of	these
cycles	 (whether	 they	 last	 a	 minute	 or	 an	 eon).	 He	 who	 does	 not	 fulfill	 the
smallest	moment	can	never	fulfill	the	larger	cycle—a	doctrine	implied	in	the	last
section	of	Patanjali’s	aphorisms	on	Yoga.

This	 is	 both	 holistic	 and	 astrological	 philosophy;	 for	 astrology	 has	 no	 real
value	unless	it	enables	us	more	fully	and	significantly	to	live	the	moment,	or	any
cycle	during	which	we	are	progressing.	To	live	fully	every	moment	is	to	find	in
every	 moment	 Light,	 and	 to	 become	 illumined	 by	 this	 Light.	 Darkness	 is	 ever
the	result	of	unfulfillment.	The	unfulfilled	moments	or	cycles	cast	their	shadow
over	the	future	moments:	this	is	karma—or	what	we	called	previously	“negative
time,”	un-illumined	time.

Selfhood	 progresses	 by	 fulfillment	 of	 the	 moments;	 and	 each	 moment	 or
cycle	presents	us	with	a	new	quality	which	is	to	be	fulfilled.	Each	birth	is	thus
for	 the	 universal	 whole	 a	 problem	 of	 fulfillment.	 The	 whole	 finds	 in	 every
nativity	a	quality,	a	new	dharma	(in	Hindu	terminology)	to	be	fulfilled.	It	is	not
only	that	“whatever	is	born	or	done	this	moment	of	time,	has	the	qualities	of	this

moment	of	time”	(Jung,	op.	cit.	p.	143),	but	that	every	moment	creates	for	every
whole	 the	 duty	 to	 fulfill	 the	 quality	 of	 that	 moment.	 This	 principle	 has	 a
purposive	 as	 well	 as	 an	 explanatory	 meaning.	 And	 this	 brings	 to	 it	 an	 ever
greater	psychological	value.	As	we	shall	see	later	on,	the	function	of	astrology	is
not	 to	 tell	 us	 what	 will,	 or	 rather	 what	 may,	 happen	 in	 the	 future,	 but	 what
significance	 there	 is	 in	 every	 moment	 or	 cycle	 lived	 or	 about	 to	 be	 lived.	 It
reveals	the	quality	of	particular	moments	and	of	the	larger	cycles	rooted	in	those
moments.

This	 is	 apparently	 well	 understood	 by	 C	 G.	 Jung	 who	 said,	 in	 the	 same

### memorial	address:

“Astrology	would	be	a	large	scale	example	of	synchronism,	if	it	had	at	its
disposal	thoroughly	tested	findings.	...	In	so	far	as	there	are	any	really	correct
astrological	deductions;	they	are	not	due	to	the	effects	of	the	constellations,
but	to	our	hypothetical	time-characters.	In	other	words,	whatever	is	born	or
done	this	moment,	has	the	qualities	of	this	moment	of	time.

“This	 is	 also	 the	 fundamental	 formula	 for	 the	 use	 of	 the	 Yi	King.	 As	 is
known,	one	gains	knowledge	of	the	hexagram	characterizing	the	moment	by
a	method	of	manipulating	sticks	of	yarrow,	or	coins,	a	method	depending	on
purest	chance.	As	the	moment	is,	so	do	the	runic	sticks	fall.	.	.	.

“The	type	of	thought	built	on	the	synchronistic	principle,	which	reaches
its	high	point	in	the	Yi	King,	is	the	purest	expression	of	Chinese	thinking	in
general.	 With	 us	 this	 thinking	 has	 been	 absent	 from	 philosophy	 since	 the
time	of	Heraclitus,	and	only	reappears	as	a	faint	echo	in	Leibnitz.	However,
in	 the	 time	 between,	 it	 was	 not	 extinguished,	 but	 continued	 to	 live	 in	 the
twilight	of	astrological	speculation,	and	remains	today	at	this	level.”*

### Astrology	and	Its	Application	to	Psychology

The	 great	 value,	 for	 us,	 in	 the	 above	 quotations	 is	 the	 fact	 that	 they	 come
from	 probably	 the	 greatest	 psychologist	 of	 our	 time.	 If	 Dr.	 Jung,	 first	 scientist
and	 practicing	 psychiatrist,	 then	 pupil	 of	 Freud,	 finally	 exponent	 of	 his	 own
findings	 and	 interpretations	 as	 founder	 of	 the	 Zurich	 school	 of	 analytical
psychology,	 discovered	 this	 “synchronistic”	 principle	 as	 a	 result	 of	 his
psychological	 practice,	 the	 fact	 is	 indeed	 significant.	 For	 it	 shows	 that	 while
causalism	 and	 mechanism	 have	 proven	 invaluable	 in	 the	 study	 of	 physical
phenomena,	they	have	failed	to	explain	many	of	the	most	characteristic	among
psychological	 phenomena.	 Thus,	 in	 a	 way,	 the	 thesis	 of	 Bergson	 is	 justified.

Spatial	 values	 refer	 to	 matter;	 but	 everything	 psychological	 needs	 for	 its
explanation	 values	 based	 on
the
time,—real
synchronistic	principle	fits	in	the	psychological	picture,	for	it	represents	a	time-
evaluation.	It	is	based	on	the	formative	potency	of	the	moment.	Thus	astrology
and	psychology	become	intimately	linked.	In	fact,	Dr.	Jung	says:

### that	 endures.	 Thus

### time

“Astrology	 is	 assured	 of	 recognition	 from	 psychology,	 without	 further
the

### the	 summation	 of	 all

restrictions,	 because	 astrology	 represents
psychological	knowledge	of	antiquity.”	(op.	cit.	p.	143)

Important	 and	 valuable	 as	 this	 statement	 undoubtedly	 is,	 we	 must	 say,
however,	that	it	implies	a	conception	of	the	nature	of	astrology	which	we	have
shown	to	be,	strictly	speaking,	incorrect.	Astrology,	even	as	traditionally	handed
down	by	Ptolemy,	is	not	the	summation	of	ancient	psychology.	First,	because	it
refers	 to	 many	 things	 besides	 psychology—from	 governmental	 matters	 to
weather	 and	 the	 condition	 of	 crops.	 Secondly,	 because—as	 we	 saw	 in	 the	 first
part	 of	 the	 preceding	 chapter—astrology	 is	 not	 to	 be	 identified,	 in	 its	 essence,
with	any	experimental	or	empirical	science,	but	rather	is	the	organizing	principle
of	 such	 sciences	 as	 deal	 with	 life	 and	 significance	 in	 relation	 to	 “organic
wholes,”	 much	 as	 mathematics	 is	 the	 organizing	 principle	 of	 sciences	 dealing
with	inanimate	matter	and	the	realm	of	“parts.”

It	is	true	that	the	body	of	concepts,	judgments	and	opinions	handed	down	to
us	by	Ptolemy	and	the	Arabian	astrologers	can	give	us	an	excellent	idea	of	what
the	psychology	of	antiquity	was.	But	this	is	because	the	books	which	we	have	on
astrology	 are	 collections	 of	 particular	 applications	 of	 the	 principles	 of
astrological	 symbolism.	 They	 are	 text-books	 telling	 how	 to	 apply	 astrology	 to
various	 matters—psychology	 and	 human	 nature	 being	 the	 foremost	 of	 those.
They	 are	 not,	 directly	 and	 consistently,	 text-books	 of	 strict	 astrology.	 We	 must
insist	upon	this	point,	because	it	is	a	basic	one.	Lacking	an	understanding	of	this,
the	ideas	of	the	huge	majority	of	people	concerning	the	value	of	astrology	have
been	consistently	biased.

A	text-book	of	strict	astrology	should	deal	with:
1)	A	study	of	the	principles	of	what	we	called	“holistic	logic”
2)	 A	 study	 of	 the	 concrete	 data	 and	 symbolical	 implications	 of	 both

geocentric	and	heliocentric	astronomy.

3)	A	study	of	all	elements	used	by	astrology,	not	in	terms	of	any	particular
application	 thereof,	 but	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 logic	 inherent	 in	 their	 definitions	 and

mutual	correlations.

4)	 A	 general	 survey	 of	 the	 concrete	 fields	 (or	 empirical	 sciences)	 to	 which
these	 symbolical	 elements	 can	 be	 applied,	 and	 of	 the	 particular	 technique	 of
application,	 which	 must	 somewhat	 vary	 in	 each	 of	 these	 fields.	 This	 would,	 of
course,	include	characteristic	examples	of	application.

Instead	 of	 embodying	 such	 a	 program	 of	 studies,	 traditional	 astrology	 is
satisfied	 with	 stating	 the	 way	 in	 which	 a	 birth-chart	 (or	 horary,	 or	 progressed
chart)	is	to	be	erected,	and	to	tabulate	the	traditional	meanings	attached	to	every
aspect	 and	 position,	 mixing	 up	 rather	 hopelessly	 psychological,	 physiological
and	purely	divinatory	concepts.	Of	the	rationale	of	the	elements	used	in	passing
judgment	(positions,	aspects,	etc.)	very	little	is	usually	said.	It	is	only	within	the
last	 twenty	 years	 or	 so	 that	 books	 on	 astrology	 have	 attempted	 to	 study	 the
“why”	of	astrological	symbols;	and	it	is	only	in	the	case	of	the	courses	recently
delivered	by	Marc	Edmund	Jones	that	astrology	has	been	taught	as	a	vast	system
of	 symbolization	 of	 all	 realms	 of	 being	 in	 their	 triple	 correlations	 as	 form,
substance	and	activity.

This	book	is	no	attempt	to	cover	adequately	the	types	of	studies	enumerated
above.	Its	purpose	is	to	pave	the	way	to	a	new	type	of	astrology	which	would	be
philosophically	sound	and	whose	application	to	modern	psychology	would	help
men	to	live	more	significant,	therefore	more	spiritual,	lives.

Philosophical	 “soundness”	 rests	 upon	 absolute	 coherency	 of	 ideas	 and
consistency	 in	 the	 development	 and	 application	 of	 the	 basic	 principles	 and
symbols	used.	As	for	psychological	“helpfulness,”	this	would	obviously	depend
largely	 on	 the	 type	 of	 psychological	 materials	 being	 correlated	 with	 the
astrological	 symbols.	 As	 already	 said,	 most	 astrological	 text-books	 deal	 only
with	 a	 sort	 of	 “common	 sense”	 psychology,	 rather	 superficial	 in	 character;
others,	 with	 a	 psychology	 influenced	 by	 more	 or	 less	 valid	 theosophical	 ideas,
not	 always	 philosophically	 coherent	 nor	 rooted	 in	 the	 experience	 of	 modern
Western	man.	Our	aim	has	been	to	interpret	astrological	symbols	in	terms	of	an
“up-to-date”	 Western	 psychology,	 consistently	 backed	 up,	 as	 it	 were,	 by	 a
philosophy	which	brings	into	clear	relief	some	of	the	most	recent	and	the	most
vital	concepts	of	this	century.

We	are	above	all	stressing	values	and	using	a	terminology	which	are	found	in
C.	G.	Jung’s	works,	because	we	are	deeply	convinced	of	their	inherent	validity,
and	 also	 because	 they	 dovetail	 so	 remarkably	 with	 the	 general	 set-up	 of
astrological	symbolism.	Our	first	task	therefore	is	to	acquaint	the	reader	with	the

general	principles	of	Jung’s	“analytical	psychology,”	a	psychology	whose	roots
may	be	grounded	in	Freudian	psychoanalysis,	yet	whose	stem	and	flowering	live
in	strata	of	being	almost	as	far	removed	from	Freudian	thought	as	the	vision	of	a
Lao-Tze	or	a	Plato	is	removed	from	that	of	a	laboratory	vivisectionist.

### Three	Basic	Types	of	Psychology

In	order	to	clarify	some	matters	which	are	a	source	of	constant	confusion	it	is
necessary	 to	 recognize	 that	 the	 term	 “psychology”	 is	 used	 to	 mean	 several
different	branches	and	types	of	knowledge.	It	will	probably	be	of	great	help	to
take	 for	 granted,	 for	 the	 time	 being,	 the	 ancient	 division	 of	 man’s	 being	 into
spirit,	soul	and	body,	and	to	say	that	psychology	can	be	and	has	been	considered
from	three	basic	points	of	view.	Thus	there	is:

1)	a	spiritual	psychology,	 which	 is	 a	 branch	 of	 philosophy	 or	 religion,	 and
contemplates	 all	 human	 values,	 introspectively	 and	 intuitionally,	 in	 terms	 of
beliefs,	or	intuitions,	or	transcendental	perceptions.

2)	 a	 physiological	 psychology,	 which	 considers	 all	 the	 processes	 usually
classified	as	“psychological”	(sensation,	attention,	feelings,	thoughts,	etc.)	from
the	standpoint	of	physiological	functions.

3)	an	analytical	psychology,	which	deals	primarily	and	directly	with	the	facts
of	 consciousness	 and	 the	 structural	 relationship	 existing	 between	 the	 various
functions	of	the	psyche	per	se.

The	 spiritual	 type	 of	 psychology	 considers	 man	 to	 be	 essentially	 and	 in
reality	 a	 spiritual	 being	 using	 a	 body	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 acquiring	 concrete
experiences	 and	 certain	 faculties	 which	 can	 be	 generated	 only	 in	 contact	 with
matter.	Corporate	existence	is,	however,	taken	to	be	the	result	of	a	“fall”	and	as
such	 has	 a	 pejorative	 connotation.	 The	 soul	 is	 immortal	 insofar	 as	 it	 has
assimilated	 to	 itself	 the	 spiritual	 essence,	 and	 liberation	 from	 the	 thralldom	 of
natural	energies	is	the	goal.	Such	a	psychology,	which	is	particularly	exemplified
in	 the	 Christian	 Fathers’	 ideas	 and,	 to	 a	 very	 large	 extent,	 in	 Platonic	 psycho-
philosophy,	is	bound	up	with	ethics.	The	physical	world	is	the	world	of	shadows,
if	not	of	sin;	and	truth,	goodness	and	reality	abide	in	an	archetypal	world,	which
is,	 in	 a	 sense,	 a	 concrete	 (or	 at	 least	 substantial)	 spiritual	 realm.	 Psychology	 is
largely	a	matter	of	understanding	how	these	archetypal	realities	and	the	human
soul	(which	belongs	to	their	realm	essentially)	react	to	the	illusions	and	shams	of
the	natural	world;	and	by	what	process	the	soul,	lost	in	the	mesh	of	the	body,	can
disentangle	 itself	 and	 regain	 its	 primordial	 status—plus	 a	 “consciousness	 of

relation”	which	is	the	fruition	of	the	embodied	state.

This	type	of	psychology	is	found	predominant	in	the	Orient	(but	by	no	means
exclusively	 held	 there	 as	 true),	 and	 wherever	 religious,	 ethico-spiritual,
alchemical	valuations	are	emphasized	at	the	expense	of	physical	or	materialistic
ones.	 It	 is	 found	 in	 a	 great	 variety	 of	 manifestations,	 each	 philosophical	 or
religious	system	giving	it	a	particular	formulation.	It	is	the	usual	foundation	of
traditional	occultism,	but	there	we	find	it	sometimes	strongly	associated	with	a
type	 of	 structural	 psychology	 which	 differentiates	 occult	 psychology	 from	 the
purely	religious	type.	Yet	the	differentiation	is	not	sharp,	and	is,	in	appearance	at
least,	a	mere	matter	of	relative	emphasis.

The	physiological	type	of	psychology	is	one	in	which	psychic	reactions—as
sensations,	 feelings,	 ideations	 and	 volitions—are	 considered	 as	 emerging	 from
and	strictly	conditioned	by	physiological	processes.	The	method	of	such	a	type
of	 rigorously	 empirical	 and	 experimental	 psychology	 is	 the	 purely	 scientific
method,	 and	 it	 is	 to	 such	 a	 psychology	 only	 that	 scientists	 usually	 refer	 as
“psychology.”	 Barring	 whatever	 there	 may	 have	 been	 in	 India	 which	 could	 be
referred	to	that	class	of	psychological	study,	we	can	date	the	beginning	of	such	a
type	of	psychology	from	Aristotle.	Before	him	there	was	of	course	a	long	period
of	archaic	psychology,	which	could	be	called	“physiological”	in	the	sense	that	in
archaic	 thought	 the	 soul	 was	 not	 differentiated	 from	 the	 body	 in	 the	 way	 in
which	 it	 became	 so	 distinguished	 after	 Pythagoras.	 As	 we	 saw	 in	 a	 previous
chapter,	 the	 unity	 of	 living	 nature	 and	 of	 living	 man	 became	 definitely	 broken
into	 a	 physical	 and	 a	 psycho-mental	 realm	 only	 around	 the	 sixth	 century	 B.C.
And	therefore	the	care	of	the	body	(medicine)	included	to	some	extent	matters
pertaining	to	the	psyche.

In	 fact,	 however,	 considerations	 pertaining	 to	 the	 united	 body-psyche
belonged	 to	 the	 nascent	 province	 of	 alchemy.	 Alchemy	 is	 the	 science	 of	 the
human	being	considered	as	a	compound	of	physio-psychological	processes.	The
doctrine	of	the	four	humors	of	the	body	(blood,	phlegm,	black	bile	and	yellow
bile)	corresponding	to	the	four	elements	of	astrology	(fire,	earth,	air	and	water),
and	 leading	 to	 the	 Arabian	 enumeration	 of	 four	 temperaments	 (sanguine,
phlegmatic,	 melancholic	 and	 choleric),	 is	 an	 alchemical	 doctrine.	 In	 archaic
alchemy	(which	is	closely	related	to	the	original	forms	of	the	Hindu	Hatha	Yoga,
and	 still	 more	 to	 later	 Taoism)	 the	 conception	 of	 the	 soul	 is	 not	 very	 well
defined,	 because	 spirit	 and	 matter	 are	 seen	 in	 adunation.	 The	 vital	 body	 (or
pneumatic	body)	is	within	the	physiological	organism,	as	the	fibres	of	the	mango

fruit	are	within	the	fruit	itself—and	the	aim	of	the	ancient	practical	applications
of	alchemy	is	to	disentangle	the	former	from	the	latter—thus	releasing	for	use	a
spiritual	body,	free	from	the	earthly	quality	of	the	physical	body,	and	the	seat	of
a	new	consciousness,	which	can	then	be	called	the	Soul.

In	other	words,	archaic	psychology	is	only	most	superficially	to	be	related	to
the	scientific	type	of	physiological	psychology,	just	as	chemistry	is	to	alchemy.
From	Aristotle	the	lineage	of	modern	scientific	psychology	passes	through	Galen
and	 the	 medieval	 physiologists,	 through	 Francis	 Bacon,	 Thomas	 Hobbes,
Malebranche,	 James	 Mill,	 Johannes	 Muller,	 Lotze,	 Wundt,	 William	 James,
reaching	 finally	 to	 the	 Behaviorists,	 the	 “Gestalt”	 group,	 and	 an	 endocrino-
psychologist	 like	 Dr.	 Berman	 (Glands	 Regulating	 Personality).	 The	 latter
emphasizes	what	he	calls	the	“body-mind”—i.e.,	the	unity	of	physiological	and
psychological	 processes—in	 a	 way	 which	 is	 similar,	 though	 diametrically
opposite	 in	 its	 practical	 methods,	 to	 archaic	 alchemy.	 Dr.	 Berman	 aims	 at	 the
production	of	the	perfect	human	being	through	generalized	gland-treatment	and
the	 establishment	 of	 perfect	 functional	 harmony.	 The	 true	 alchemists	 had	 the
same	 purpose,	 but	 they	 had	 it	 on	 different	 grounds,	 and	 tried	 to	 reach	 it	 by
different	methods.

The	third	basic	type	of	approach	to	psychology,	what	we	called	the	analytical
type,*	deals	directly	and	immediately	with	facts	of	the	mental	life,	or	rather	with
what	it	calls	“psychic	contents.”

It	 does	 not	 lay	 any	 emphasis	 on	 the	 problem	 of	 the	 exact	 origin	 of	 these
contents;	 that	 is	 to	 say,	 it	 does	 not	 particularly	 study	 the	 process	 by	 which	 a
nerve-impression	 or	 series	 of	 impressions	 becomes	 a	 truly	 psychic	 sensation
which	in	turn	transforms	itself	into	habit,	thought,	instinct,	etc.	It	considers	the
psychic	 life	 of	 man	 as	 a	 domain	 in	 itself,	 and	 is	 mainly	 preoccupied	 with	 the
study	of	what	happens	in	this	realm	considered	as	a	more	or	less	self-sufficient
and	autonomous	one.

This,	 however,	 must	 not	 be	 construed	 as	 meaning	 that	 the	 analytical
psychologist	considers	the	psyche	as	essentially	different	from	the	body.	On	the
contrary,	Freud	and	Jung	began	their	psychological	work	as	physicians;	and	even
in	 the	 latest	 formulations	 which	 have	 been	 presented	 by	 Jung,	 the	 therapeutic
element	is	very	strong.	But	psychic	health	is	emphasized.	The	point	of	approach
of	analytic	psychology	is	actually	from	the	body	to	what	it	calls	the	psyche.	But
while	 the	 Behaviorist	 and	 the	 strictly	 “scientific”	 psychologist	 are	 to	 be
compared	to	laboratory	investigators	in	their	study	of	the	chemistry	and	physics

of	separate	psychic	elements,	the	“analyst”—especially	Jung—is	essentially	the
physician	 or	 healer,	 who	 deals	 with	 the	 functional	 balance	 of	 the	 psychic
organism	as	a	whole.

In	 other	 words,	 the	 analyst	 studies	 the	 facts	 of	 psychic	 functioning,	 the
structural	pattern	made	by	the	inter-relationship	of	all	these	facts,	the	behavior	of
the	 whole	 psyche.	 What	 also	 differentiates	 analytical	 psychology	 from	 the
“physiological”	type	above	mentioned	is	the	fact	that	it	is	purposeful.	It	does	not
analyze	for	the	sake	of	mere	investigation,	but	with	the	definite	aim	to	heal,	to
cure,	to	make	whole.	What	it	attempts	to	make	whole	is	first	of	all	the	psyche.
But	not	only	does	it	recognize	the	interdependence	of	body	and	psyche.	It	almost
postulates	their	identity.	Jung	writes	in	Modern	Man	in	Search	of	a	Soul	(p.	85):

“The	 distinction	 between	 mind	 and	 body	 is	 an	 artificial	 dichotomy,	 a
discrimination	which	is	unquestionably	based	far	more	on	the	peculiarity	of
intellectual	understanding	than	on	the	nature	of	things.	In	fact,	so	intimate	is
the	intermingling	of	bodily	and	psychic	traits	that	not	only	can	we	draw	far-
reaching	inferences	as	to	the	constitution	of	the	psyche	from	the	constitution
of	 the	 body,	 but	 we	 can	 also	 infer	 from	 psychic	 peculiarities	 the
corresponding	bodily	characteristics.”

The	same	thought	is	even	more	strongly	formulated	in	his	Commentary	on	The
Secret	of	the	Golden	Flower	(p.	131):

“It	is	characteristic	of	the	Westerner	that,	for	purpose	of	knowledge,	he
has	split	apart	the	physical	and	the	spiritual	sides	of	life;	but	these	opposites
lie	 together	 in	 the	 psyche,	 and	 psychology	 must	 recognize	 the	 fact.	 The
‘psychic’	is	both	physical	and	mental.”

### In	another	place	he	writes:

“The	 psyche	 is	 a	 self-regulating	 system	 that	 maintains	 itself	 in
equilibrium	as	the	body	does.	Every	body	that	goes	too	far,	immediately	and
inevitably	 calls	 forth	 a	 compensatory	 activity.	 Without	 such	 adjustments	 a
normal	 metabolism	 would	 not	 exist,	 nor	 would	 the	 normal	 psyche.	 We	 can
take	the	idea	of	compensation,	so	understood,	as	a	law	of	psychic	happening.
Too	little	on	one	side	results	in	too	much	on	the	other.	The	relation	between
conscious	and	unconscious	is	compensatory.”

### (Modern	Man	in	Search	of	a	Soul,	p.	20)

A	 brief	 study	 of	 the	 meaning	 which	 Jung	 attributes	 to	 the	 terms	 conscious	and
unconscious	may	help	the	reader	to	get	a	clearer	picture	of	what	Jung	intends	to
convey	by	the	word	psyche.

### Conscious	and	Unconscious

According	 to	 Freud,	 all	 mental	 processes	 (apart	 from	 the	 reception	 of
external	stimuli)	are	derived	from	the	interplay	of	forces	which	are	originally	of
the	 nature	 of	 instincts;	 that	 is	 to	 say,	 which	 have	 an	 organic	 origin.	 There	 is,
however,	 a	 force	 in	 the	 mind	 which	 can	 exclude	 from	 consciousness	 and	 from
any	 influence	 upon	 action	 all	 tendencies	 which,	 for	 some	 reason,	 are	 not
acceptable	to	it.	Such	tendencies	are	“repressed.”	They	fall	below	the	threshold
of	consciousness	and	become	unconscious	contents.	These	repressed	instinctual
impulses,	 however,	 are	 not	 made	 powerless;	 they	 act	 indirectly,	 causing
psychological	and	physiological	disturbances.

Jung	admits	the	existence	of	these	repressed	contents	which	in	their	sum	total
constitute	 what	 he	 calls	 the	 “personal	 unconscious”;	 but	 he	 also	 speaks	 of	 a
“collective	unconscious”	which	has	an	entirely	different	origin	and	significance:

“Just	as	the	human	body	shows	a	common	anatomy	over	and	above	all
racial	 differences,	 so	 too,	 does	 the	 psyche	 possess	 a	 common	 substratum.	 I
have	 called	 the	 latter	 the	 collective	 unconscious.	 As	 a	 common	 human
heritage	 it	 transcends	 all	 differences	 of	 culture	 and	 consciousness	 and	 does
not	consist	merely	of	contents	capable	of	becoming	conscious,	but	of	latent
dispositions	 toward	 identical	 reactions.	 Thus	 the	 fact	 of	 the	 collective
unconscious	 is	 simply	 the	 psychic	 expression	 of	 identity	 of	 brain-structure
irrespective	 of	 all	 racial	 differences.	 By	 its	 means	 can	 be	 explained	 the
analogy,	 going	 even	 as	 far	 as	 identity	 between	 various	 myth-themes	 and
symbols,	and	the	possibility	of	human	understanding	in	general.	The	various
lines	 of	 psychic	 development	 start	 from	 one	 common	 stock	 whose	 roots
reach	back	into	the	past.

“Taken	purely	psychologically,	it	means	that	we	have	common	instincts
of	 ideation	 (imagination),	 and	 of	 action.	 All	 conscious	 imagination	 and
action	have	grown	out	of	these	unconscious	prototypes	and	remain	bound	up
with	them.”

(Commentary	on	The	Secret	of	the	Golden	Flower,	p.	83)
The	relation	of	conscious	to	unconscious	is	further	described	in	the	following

### statements:

“Without	a	doubt,	consciousness	is	derived	from	the	unconscious.	This	is
something	we	remember	too	little,	and	therefore	we	are	always	attempting	to
identify	the	psyche	with	consciousness;	or	at	least	attempting	to	represent	the
unconscious	as	a	derivative,	or	an	effect	of	the	conscious	(as	for	instance	in
the	Freudian	repression	theory).”

### (Commentary	on	The	Secret	of	the	Golden	Flower,	p.	119)

### “The	unconscious	has	contents	peculiar	to	itself,	which,	slowly	growing

### upward	from	the	depths,	at	last	come	into	consciousness.”

(Modern	Man	in	Search	of	a	Soul,	p.	37)
Such	contents,	which	arise	from	the	depths	of	the	collective	unconscious	are
usually	 given	 the	 name	 of	 “archetypes”	 or	 “primordial	 images.”	 It	 is	 also	 said
that	 “instincts	 are	 archetypes,”	 and	 that	 “the	 contents	 of	 the	 collective
unconscious	 are	 not	 merely	 the	 archaic	 residua	 of	 specifically	 human	 ways	 of
functioning,	 but	 also	 the	 residua	 of	 functions	 of	 the	 animal	 ancestry	 of
mankind.”	They	.	.	.

“can	 be	 found	 in	 all	 minds.	 The	 primordial	 images	 are	 the	 deepest,	 the
most	ancient	and	the	most	universal	thoughts	of	humanity.	They	are	as	much
feelings	 as	 thoughts,	 and	 have	 indeed	 an	 individual,	 independent	 existence,
somewhat	 like	 that	 of	 the	 ‘partial	 souls’	 which	 we	 can	 easily	 discern	 in	 all
those	 philosophical	 or	 gnostic	 systems	 which	 base	 themselves	 upon	 the
apperception	of	the	unconscious	as	the	source	of	knowledge,	as	for	example,
Steiner’s	 anthroposophical	 Geisteswis-senschaft.	 The	 conception	 of	 angels,
archangels,	 ‘principalities	 and	 powers’	 in	 St.	 Paul,	 of	 the	 archontes	 and
kingdoms	of	light	in	the	Gnostics,	of	the	heavenly	hierarchies	in	Dyonisius
the	Areopagite,	all	come	from	the	perception	of	the	relative	independence	of
the	archetypes	of	the	collective	unconscious.”

### (Two	Essays	on	Analytical	Psychology,	p.	68)

We	shall	not	attempt	to	discuss	here	the	most	debatable	statements	contained
in	the	last	part	of	this	quotation,	as	our	present	purpose	is	merely	to	present	some
of	the	basic	concepts	of	analytical	psychology,	to	which	we	shall	make	frequent
references	 in	 the	 rest	 of	 this	 book.	 As,	 however,	 the	 problem	 of	 the	 “real”
existence	of	“gods”	and	“occult	beings”	is	of	great	interest	to	most	students	of
astrology,	 we	 shall	 mention	 it	 again	 in	 the	 chapter	 “Individual,	 Collective,
Creative	and	the	Cyclic	Process,”	and	we	shall	try	to	show	what	relation	exists
between	Jung’s	“primordial	images”	and	at	least	certain	of	the	classes	of	cosmic

beings	mentioned	by	religions	and	occultism.

The	 main	 point	 to	 consider	 is	 that,	 while	 Freud	 gives	 to	 the	 unconscious	 a
purely	 secondary	 and	 negative	 character,	 Jung	 sees	 it	 as	 a	 positive	 and
primordial	factor,	in	fact	as	the	very	matrix	out	of	which	the	conscious	grows	by
differentiation.	 He	 recognizes,	 however,
the	 existence	 of	 a	 “personal
unconscious”	which	is	the	result	of	inhibitions	and	perversions	occurring	during
the	 process	 of	 differentiation	 of	 the	 conscious.	 This	 “personal	 unconscious”	 is
almost	identical	with	Freud’s	unconscious.	But,	though	a	basic	factor	in	Jung’s
psychotherapy,	 it	 leaves	 to	 the	 “collective	 unconscious”	 the	 place	 of	 main
importance	in	his	general	philosophy	and	attitude	to	life.

With	 Freud	 and	 Adler,	 psychology	 is	 almost	 entirely	 a	 matter	 of
psychological	healing.	The	former	emphasizes	the	cure	of	psychic	disturbances
which	 are	 almost	 strictly	 considered	 as	 illnesses,	 and,	 after	 having	 tentatively
removed	the	causes	of	the	condition,	“nature”	is	more	or	less	left	to	handle	the
situation.	On	the	other	hand,	Adler	deals	more	particularly	with	the	problem	of
readjusting	 to	 social	 conditions	 and	 collective	 values	 the	 individual	 who,	 for
some	 reason,	 was	 unable	 to	 make	 a	 correct	 social	 adjustment	 in	 youth	 or
thereafter.	 He	 starts	 from	 the	 individual	 and	 his	 inability	 as	 an	 individual	 to
function	 in	 the	 collectivity;	 whereas	 Freud	 attempts	 rather	 to	 remove	 from	 the
submerged	 parts	 of	 the	 individual	 psyche	 the	 results	 of	 the	 lies	 and	 the
perversions	 imposed	 upon	 the	 individual	 by	 the	 collective	 (family	 and	 race
habits,	inherited	tendencies,	environmental	influences,	etc.).

Jung	 attempts	 not	 only	 to	 synthetize	 the	 two	 approaches	 in	 his	 therapeutic
practice,	but	he	reaches	much	further.	He	tends	to	become	a	“healer	of	souls”	in
a	 manner	 reminiscent	 of	 spiritual	 teachers	 and	 of	 Oriental	 gurus—especially
perhaps	the	teachers	of	the	Zen	school	in	Japan.	We	said	only	“reminiscent;”	for
obviously	 Jung’s	 technique	 is	 quite	 different	 from	 those	 of	 ancient	 “spiritual
teachers.”	The	point	is,	nevertheless,	that	he	holds	definitely	an	ideal	of	human
consummation	 before	 his	 clients	 and	 before	 humanity	 in	 general.	 His	 work	 is
purposive	 and	 integrative.	 He	 yearns	 for	 the	 complete	 human	 being.	 He
envisions,	 not	 exactly	 a	 “superman,”	 but	 a	 “whole-man.”	 And	 he	 attempts	 to
lead	man	toward	the	fulfillment	of	this	vision—toward	the	goal	of	what	he	calls
individuation.

To	understand	the	full	meaning	of	this	term	it	is	necessary	to	grasp	first	the
situation	 created,	 philosophically	 and	 practically,	 by	 Jung’s	 division	 of	 the

### Individuation

### into

two	 positive	 realms—conscious	 and	 unconscious.	 Freud’s
psyche
unconscious	 offered	 no	 special	 problem,	 save	 that	 of	 getting	 rid	 of	 it.	 It	 was	 a
negative	quasi-pathological	shadow	which	the	light	of	increased	and	normalized
consciousness	at	least	theoretically	dissipated.	But	Jung’s	collective	unconscious
is	 not	 to	 be	 dissipated,	 but	 to	 be	 assimilated.	 It	 is	 the	 sea	 from	 which	 the
conscious	ego	emerges;	a	sea	which	may	drown	this	ego,	but	which	on	the	other
hand,	 once	 functioning	 within	 the	 structure	 of	 an	 organic	 and	 complete
conscious	 being,	 a	 Self,	 becomes	 as	 the	 blood	 thereof—the	 blood	 which	 is
individualized	sea-water.

This	 is	 of	 course	 a	 symbol.	 But	 it	 holds	 some	 truth	 as	 to	 the	 nature	 of	 the
relationship	 of	 the	 conscious	 to	 the	 great	 unconscious.	 The	 latter	 is	 to	 be
integrated	to	the	former,	and	this	process	of	integration	which	reunites	the	two
polarities	 of	 the	 psyche	 is	 a	 process	 of	 constant	 assimilation	 of	 unconscious
contents	 by	 the	 conscious.	 Through	 this	 process,	 which	 is	 also	 one	 of
psychological	“marriage”	within	the	individual	man,	the	ego—the	center	of	the
conscious—grows	as	it	were	beyond	itself	and	becomes	the	fully	integrated	Self
—the	center	of	the	totality	of	man’s	fully	developed	being.	This	consummation
(which,	in	a	sense,	is	never	final,	for	the	existence	of	spheres	within	spheres	of
collective	 unconscious	 can	 be	 conceived	 or	 postulated)	 is	 individuation:	 the
“making	whole,”	or	“making	perfect”	of	older	systems	of	spiritual	development
—yet	with	a	difference	due	to	the	new	mental	level	reached	by	mankind.

### Jung	is	careful	to	distinguish	between	the	ideal	of	individualism	(especially

### “rugged	individualism”!)	and	that	of	individuation.	He	writes:

“Individuation	means	to	become	a	single,	discrete	being,	and,	inasmuch
as	the	concept	individuality	embraces	that	innermost,	last	and	incomparable
uniqueness	of	our	being,	it	also	includes	the	idea	of	becoming	one’s	own	real
self.	Hence	individuation	could	also	be	translated	as	‘coming	to	selfhood’	or
‘self-realization.’	 .	 .	 .	 Individualism	 is	 a	 purposeful	 attempt	 to	 stress	 and
make	 conspicuous	 some	 ostensible	 peculiarity,	 in	 opposition	 to	 collective
considerations	 and	 obligations.	 But	 individuation	 means	 precisely	 a	 better
and	 more	 complete	 fulfillment	 of	 the	 collective	 dispositions	 of	 mankind,
since	 an	 adequate	 consideration	 of	 the	 peculiarity	 of	 the	 individual	 is	 more
conducive	 to	 a	 better	 social	 achievement,	 than	 when	 the	 peculiarity	 is
neglected	 or	 repressed.	 For	 the	 uniqueness	 of	 an	 individual	 must	 not	 be
understood	 as	 mere	 strangeness,	 or	 singularity	 of	 his	 substance	 or
components,	but	rather	as	a	peculiar	combination	of	elements,	or	as	a	gradual

differentiation	 of	 functions	 and	 capacities	 which,	 in	 themselves,	 are
universal.	 .	 .	 .	 Individuation	 can	 only	 mean	 a	 psychological	 evolutionary
process	 that	 fulfills	 the	 given	 individual	 disposition.	 In	 other	 words	 it	 is	 a
process	by	which	a	man	can	create	of	himself	that	definite,	unique	being	that
he	 feels	 himself,	 at	 bottom,	 to	 be.	 In	 so	 doing	 he	 does	 not	 become	 ‘self-
centered’	 in	 the	 ordinary	 sense	 of	 the	 word;	 he	 is	 merely	 fulfilling	 the
particularity	 of	 his	 nature,	 something	 vastly	 different	 from	 egoism	 of
individualism.

“Inasmuch	 as	 the	 human	 individual,	 as	 a	 living	 unity,	 is	 made	 up	 of
universal	 factors,	 this	 unity	 is	 wholly	 collective,	 and	 therefore	 in	 no	 sense
opposed	to	collectivity.	.	.	.	Individuation	aims	at	an	essential	cooperation	of
all	factors.”

### (Two	Essays	on	Analytical	Psychology)

### Esthetics	vs.	Ethics

Before	 we	 point	 out	 briefly	 the	 main	 features	 of	 the	 technique	 which	 Jung
uses	to	bring	about	the	goal	of	individuation,	it	seems	important	that	we	should
establish	at	once	how	the	ideal	of	individuation,	of	“an	essential	cooperation	of
all	 factors”	 within	 the	 total	 human	 being,	 leads	 to	 a	 revision	 of	 our	 traditional
concept	 of	 ethics	 and	 morals.	 This	 is	 of	 course	 a	 very	 delicate	 subject	 which
allows	of	grave	misunderstandings,	and	so	we	beg	our	readers	not	to	infer,	from
what	we	shall	say,	conclusions	which	would	in	no	way	be	warranted.

As	 we	 shall	 see	 in	 the	 beginning	 of	 our	 second	 part,	 the	 very	 act	 of	 living
implies	two	basic	directions	of	functional	operation	which	can	be	characterized
by	the	terms	awareness	and	experience.	In	a	sense,	the	division	is	not	unlike	that
of	stimulus	and	response,	but	with	a	much	more	general	significance	attached	to
it.	We	become	“aware”	of	internal	as	well	as	external	facts,	of	the	subject,	or	self
within,	 as	 well	 as	 of	 the	 object,	 or	 outer	 world.	 Awareness,	 following	 a	 well-
defined	process,	leads	to	a	more	or	less	concrete,	or	at	least	a	formed	reaction,	in
which	the	ego	and	what	he	has	become	aware	of	interpenetrate.	The	result	of	this
inter-penetration	 is	 what	 we	 call,	 in	 the	 philosophical	 sense	 of	 the	 term,	 an
experience,	that	is	“a	moment	lived	through.”

Every	 kind	 of	 “living	 through”	 implies	 a	 sort	 of	 judgment	 passed	 upon:	 1)
whatever	 one	 has	 been	 aware	 of;	 2)	 the	 relation	 of	 oneself	 to	 that	 thing	 or
quality.	 But	 the	 judgment	 can	 be	 fundamentally	 of	 two	 kinds.	 In	 one	 case	 it
manifests	as	a	feeling,	in	the	other	as	a	thought	Jung	describes	feeling	as	follows:

“Feeling	 is	 primarily	 a	 process	 that	 takes	 place	 between	 the	 ego	 and	 a
given	 content,	 a	 process,	 moreover,	 that	 imparts	 to	 the	 content	 a	 definite
value	 in	 the	 sense	 of	 acceptance	 or	 rejection	 (like’	 or	 ‘dislike’);	 but	 it	 can
also	 appear,	 as	 it	 were,	 isolated	 in	 the	 form	 of	 ‘mood’	 quite	 apart	 from	 the
momentary	contents	of	consciousness	or	momentary	sensations.	.	.	.	But	even
the	mood	.	.	.	signifies	a	valuation;	not,	however,	a	valuation	of	one	definite,
individual	 conscious	 content,	 but	 of	 the	 whole	 conscious	 situation	 at	 the
moment.	.	.	.	Feeling	is	also	a	kind	of	judging,	differing,	however,	from	an
intellectual	 judgment,	 in	 that	 it	 does	 not	 aim	 at	 establishing	 an	 intellectual
connection	 but	 is	 solely	 concerned	 with	 the	 setting	 up	 of	 a	 subjective
criterion	of	acceptance	or	rejection”

### (Psychological	Types,	p.	544)

Without	going	further	into	the	matter	it	will	be	clear	that	all	purely	moral	or
ethical	 valuations	 are	 related	 to	 feelings;	 that	 is	 to	 say,	 they	 are	 immediate
judgments	passed	on	the	value	of	a	content	of	the	psyche	or	of	a	whole	situation.
The	image	that	came	into	the	consciousness	or	the	situation	in	which	one	finds
oneself	 in	 relation	 to	 other	 objects	 or	 persons	 is	 “good”	 or	 “bad.”	 The	 ego
accepts	it	or	rejects	it	in	an	immediate	direct	manner	and	on	the	basis	of	either	a
deep-rooted	 instinct	 or	 an	 equally	 deep-rooted	 traditional	 collective	 attitude.
Morals	are	constituted	by	a	set	of	traditional	judgments	concerning	more	or	less
clearly	 defined	 situations	 or	 relationships,	 some	 of	 which	 are	 based	 on	 what
appears	as	biological	instinct,	others	of	which	are	the	results	of	an	attitude	to	life
consciously	and	deliberately	stressed	by	a	religious,	social	or	philosophical	code
of	values.

Feeling-judgments,	 and	 more	 specifically	 ethical	 judgments	 as	 to	 what	 is
“good”	or	“bad,”	are	valuable	in	that	they	consider	the	whole	of	a	situation	and
its	 bearing	 upon	 the	 whole	 organism	 of	 the	 experiencer.	 No	 time	 is	 wasted	 in
intellectual	 analysis	 and	 “maybe.”	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 barring	 those	 feeling-
judgments	 which	 are	 really	 instinctual	 reactions	 and	 deal	 with	 biological
necessities,	 ethical	 valuations	 are	 determined	 by	 a	 “prejudgment”	 and	 often	 a
prejudice,	 and	 by	 the	 quality	 and	 limitations	 of	 either	 the	 conscious	 ego	 or	 of
some	powerful	racial	image	in	the	unconscious.	In	other	words,	they	take	things
for	granted.

While	the	real	intuition	springs	from	an	immediate	adaptation	of	the	whole
of	the	experiencer	to	a	whole	situation—including	all	its	new	and	never-before-
realized	implications—an	ethical	feeling-judgment	values	every	new	situation	in

terms	of	set	traditional	estimations.	Thus	morals	are	periodically	changing	their
dictates,	and	while	they	may	be	the	expression	of	real	collective	intuitions	when
they	are	“fresh,”	they	soon	lose	their	real	significance,	as	soon	and	insofar	as	a
new	lay-out	of	basic	factors	in	human	nature	manifests.

The	 main	 point,	 however,	 which	 we	 have	 to	 make	 is	 that	 all	 ethical
judgments	divide	the	sum	total	of	experiences	into	two	categories;	one	which	is
acceptable,	the	other	which	must	be	rejected.	While	this	may	be	a	necessity	of
living	in	a	world	where	the	law	of	opposites	rules	and	all	“living	whole”	faces
destruction,	from	without	and	even	from	within—the	fact	remains	that	by	living
almost	exclusively	by	ethical	standards	or	feeling-judgments,	man	cuts	himself
off	from	experiencing	half	of	his	life-contents.

Ethical	 living	 is	 “safety	 first”	 living.	 It	 is	 living	 based	 upon	 fear.	 In	 the
jungle,	 fear	 is	 a	 real	 thing	 and	 is	 really	 the	 working	 out	 of	 the	 instinct	 of
preservation.	Run	or	die	is	the	basic	law,	in	most	cases.	The	other	solution	is	to
shut	yourself	within	walls	which	define	a	zone	of	safety	(the	home)	and	a	zone
of	danger	(the	outdoors).

Now,	if	we	recall	what	was	said	in	a	previous	chapter,	mankind	is	now,	and
has	 been	 for	 many	 centuries,	 in	 a	 sort	 of	 psycho-mental	 jungle,	 which	 the
relative	safety	of	our	civilized	physical	world	does	not	make	any	more	safe;	just
the	 contrary.	 Mentally	 speaking,	 we	 may	 say	 that	 the	 European	 emphasis	 on
intellectual	 logic	 and	 scholasticism	 had	 for	 its	 aim	 the	 building	 of	 a	 zone	 of
mental	 safety	 in	 the	 jungle	 of	 the	 newly-entered	 realm	 of	 ideation.	 Logic	 and
mathematical	 discipline	 teach	 us	 how	 to	 build	 an	 intellectual	 home	 within	 the
confines	 of	 which	 the	 power	 of	 ideation	 can	 function	 safely.	 Mathematical
formulas	constitute	a	framework	of	operative	safety.	As	long	as	you	keep	within
it	 you	 can	 trust	 the	 results	 of	 your	 ideas;	 but	 if	 you	 go	 off,	 then	 your	 chaotic
imagination	may	lead	you	astray.

Psychologically	 speaking,	 the	 same	 has	 been	 true.	 European	 ethics	 and
philosophy	 taught	 us	 to	 build	 a	 strong	 and	 well-guarded	 home	 (or	 rather,
fortified	castle):	the	conscious,	over	which	ruled	in	omnipotence	the	feudal	lord:
the	ego.	The	woman	was	enslaved	by	the	lord,	and	the	children	were	cowed	into
submission.	The	peasants	who	toiled	around	the	castle	(the	instinctual	contents
of	the	psyche)	were	admitted	to	the	castle	under	strict	supervision	of	an	armed
guard,	 when	 the	 enemy	 menaced	 the	 gates,	 safely	 locked.	 Of	 course,	 a	 lovely
chapel	 was	 built	 within	 the	 fortress	 in	 which	 an	 autocratic	 God,	 camouflaged
into	 a	 compassionate	 Savior,	 was	 worshipped.	 The	 whole	 picture	 of	 the	 feudal

civilization	 is	 an	 exact	 symbol	 (as	 is	 always	 the	 case)	 of	 what	 was	 happening
then	within	man’s	psyche.

Music	also,	the	direct	expression	of	the	psyche,	gave,	as	is	always	the	case,	a
symbolical	 picture	 of	 this	 feudal	 world;	 formalism	 and	 tonality,	 being	 splendid
illustrations	of	this	domination	of	the	ethical	principle	 of	exclusion.	 The	whole
of	 the	 Christian	 European	 civilization	 is	 based	 on	 that	 principle.	 It	 is	 based	 on
psychic	and	mental	fear;	and	on	the	sometimes	necessary	yet	always	thwarting
ideal	 of	 “safety	 first.”	 It	 did	 achieve	 greatness	 within	 the	 strict	 boundaries	 of
what	it	had	enclosed	within	its	fortress;	and	in	that	sense,	European	civilization
means	an	over-focalization	which	threw	great	and	penetrating	light	upon	what	it
had	 admitted	 as	 valuable	 and	 safe.	 Its	 fruits	 constitute	 therefore	 a	 treasure	 of
great	price.

But.	.	.	oh!	what	a	terrible	mess	was	made	of	what	it	left	outside	of	the	walls!
How	dearly	is	mankind	paying	for	a	Descartes	and	a	Bach!	How	festering	and
decaying	 the	 contents	 of	 the	 subconscious—the	 sum	 total	 of	 our	 inherited
repressions,	 moral	 condemnations	 and	 fears!	 Every	 focalization	 means
limitation,	 and	 thus	 exclusion	 of	 experiences	 and	 psychic	 contents.	 It	 must
therefore	 be	 paid	 for.	 The	 more	 one	 excludes—the	 more	 ethical	 judgments
control	 the	 outer	 and	 inner	 behavior—the	 more	 future	 generations	 (or	 in	 an
individual	life,	the	years	after	40)	will	have	to	suffer	the	consequences.	On	the
other	 hand,	 not	 to	 focalize,	 not	 to	 build	 a	 fortified	 home	 (or	 conscious)	 may
mean	a	life	of	dispersion	and	constant	dodging	of	enemies	(within	and	without);
a	life	in	which	no	solid	and	lasting	achievement	is	performed—save	perhaps	that
of	one’s	own	free	selfhood	.	.	.	which	may	be	the	greatest	of	all	achievements,
after	all!

But	 we	 do	 not	 wish	 to	 pass	 here	 any	 feeling-judgment	 against	 feeling-
judgments	or	ethical	valuations!	On	the	contrary,	we	intend	to	show	that	there	is
another	attitude	which,	while	it	does	not	deny	the	validity	of	organically	rooted
and	instinctive-intuitional	feeling-judgments,	emphasizes	a	different	principle	of
conduct:	the	principle	of	esthetics.

Esthetics	(in	the	strict	philosophical	sense	of	the	term)	is	opposed	to	ethics
(also	in	the	strict	sense	of	this	word)	very	much	as	thinking	is	opposed	to	feeling.
Thinking	is	defined	by	Jung	as:

“that	psychological	function	which,	in	accordance	with	its	own	laws,	brings
given	 presentations	 into	 conceptual	 connection.	 .	 .	 .	 The	 term	 ‘thinking’
should	 be	 confined	 to	 the	 linking	 up	 of	 representations	 by	 means	 of	 a

concept,	where,	in	other	words,	an	act	of	judgment	prevails,	whether	such
act	be	the	product	of	one’s	intention	or	not.”
What	 characterizes	 thinking	 is	 the	 fact	 that	 it	 is	 a	 linking	 up	 of	 factors.	 In
other	words,	it	establishes	“conceptual	connections,”	or	in	general	well-defined
relationships.	 It	 is	 the	 climax	 of	 the	 process	 of	 awareness	 of	 relationship.	 It
brings	 to	 light	 the	 inherent	 form	 (structure	 or	 configuration)	 of	 things	 and
situations.	The	thinking	judgment	is	not	as	to	whether	a	thing	is	in	itself	“good”
or	“bad,”	but	as	to	whether	the	form	of	a	presentation	establishes	a	valid	set	of
relationships	or	not.	It	does	not	say:	“This	thing	is	bad”—meaning	always	“for
me”	It	tells	whether	the	disposition	of	factors	in	the	situation	established	by	the
relationship	is,	first,	coherent,	then,	significant.	Having	analyzed	this	disposition
of	factors,	it	is	moreover	able	to	pass	judgment	as	to	whether,	by	emphasizing	or
restricting	some	of	these	factors,	a	new	configuration	can	be	established	which
would	be	more	coherent	and	more	significant.

total
configuration,	 constitute	 a	 form.	 The	 form	 is	 coherent	 and	 significant,	 or	 it	 is
not.	In	this	process	we	find	the	foundation	of	esthetics.	The	esthetical	judgment
is	 opposed	 to	 the	 ethical	 judgment	 in	 that	 it	 does	 not	 exclude	 any	 group	 of
elements;	but,	at	most,	subordinates	some	to	others	of	greater	significance.	It	is
said	that	the	esthetical	process	is	one	of	selection.	But	selection	does	not	mean
condemnation	 of	what	 is	 not	 selected.	If	a	 painter	 paints	 only	the	 outlines	 of	a
body	 with	 his	 ink-brush,	 this	 does	 not	 mean	 that	 he	 condemns	 the	 elements	 of
flesh,	etc.,	within	this	outline.	It	does	not	pass	an	ethical	judgment	against	them.
He	transforms	them	into	 implied	 values.	He	 selects	 certain	 factors	 and	 stresses
certain	 elements	 or	 phases	 of	 the	 total	 configuration	 presented	 by	 the	 life-
experience	(for	instance,	by	the	scene	his	eyes	behold).	But	this	stressing	must
be	so	produced	as	to	give	the	suggestion	of	all	the	elements	which	have	been	left
obviously	 unrepresented.	 In	 a	 really	 great	 work	 of	 art	 all	 elements	 of	 a	 life-
situation	are	contained;	but	some	are	represented	by	actual	presence,	others	are
implied	in	the	total	configuration.

This,	 translated	 in	 terms	 of	 everyday	 living,	 may	 be	 illustrated	 by	 the
following	example.	A	man	determines	by	ethical-judgment	or	feeling-judgment
that	 sexual	 experiences	 are	 “bad,”	 and	 acting	 upon	 the	 judgment,	 castrates
himself	(like,	for	instance,	Origen).	This	is	an	extreme	case	insofar	as	it	involves
violent	 physical	 action;	 but	 in	 a	 less	 accentuated	 form,	 all	 self-compulsive
asceticism	 is	 of	 the	 same	 type.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 we	 may	 think	 of	 a	 spiritual
person	who	has	reached	normally	beyond	the	desire	for	sex-experience.	The	sex-

force	 is	 active	 in-him,	 but	 transformed.	 It	 is	 “implied”	 but	 not	 actually
represented.	There	is	no	ethical	judgment	passed	against	it;	but,	in	the	esthetical
configuration	of	the	whole	of	his	being,	sex	is	suggested,	but	not	stressed	or	even
concretely	represented;	while	in	the	self-mutilated	man,	sex	is	always	present	but
in	a	negative	form,	that	is,	as	a	positive	shadow-therefore	as	“evil.”

Ethical	 judgments	 create	 evil.	 Esthetical	 judgments	 produce	 stresses,
emphases,	 relief,	 contrasts,	 light	 and	 shade,	 actual	 and	 implied	 representation,
climaxes	 and	 suggestions.	 They	 balance	 opposites,	 and	 never	 condemn
absolutely.	 They	 harmonize;	 never	 discard.	 They	 deal	 with	 whole	 relations,
which	 they	 estimate	 in	 the	 totality	 of	 their	 elements.	 No	 element	 can	 be
cancelled	without	impairing	the	relation.	In	fact,	no	element	in	any	relation	can
ever	be	cancelled.	One	can	only	transform	it,	by	apparent	cancellation,	into	an
evil	force.	But	for	him	who	acts	according	to	the	true	principle	of	esthetics,	there
is	 no	 “evil”;	 neither	 is	 there	 any	 “good.”	 There	 is	 only	 form	 or	 relationship,
linking	all	elements	into	a	wholeness	which	includes	light	and	shadow,	crest	and
trough,	emphasis	and	mere	implication—all	equally	significant;	but	each	with	a
particular	 significance	 of	 its	 own,	 a	 significance	 which	 may	 be	 marked	 either
with	a	 minus	or	 a	plus	 sign.	 In	 esthetics	 the	 only	 evil	 is—lack	 of	 significance;
but	it	does	not	reside	in	the	thing	or	the	situation.	For	all	things	and	all	situations,
being	 expressions	 of	 the	 moment	 of	 their	 manifestation,	 are	 inherently
significant.	 Lack	 of	 significance	 is	 due	 only	 to	 man’s	 inability	 to	 perceive
significance.	Thus	there	is	no	evil,	except	ignorance.

The	result	is	that	man	can	be	educated	into	perceiving	significances.	Ethical
compulsion,	 based	 on	 fear,	 leads	 to	 evil.	 Esthetical	 education,	 based	 on	 the
perception	 of	 coherent	 and	 significant	 relationship,	 destroys	 the	 dark	 fantasy
which	 evil	 is.	 It	 makes	 of	 all	 living	 an	 esthetic	 activity—a	 creative	 activity.	 It
destroys—or	 should	 destroy—all	 valuations	 based	 on	 past	 judgments	 and	 the
compulsion	 of	 tradition,	 as	 these	 are	 hindrances	 to	 the	 full	 living	 of	 the
wholeness	 of	 the	 moment.	 The	 wholeness	 of	 the	 moment	 is	 the	 Soul	 of	 the
moment.	 And	 the	 Soul	 of	 the	 moment	 is	 your	 Soul	 and	 mine,	 ever	 new,	 ever
young,	ever	rooted	in	significance,	ever	rooted	in	the	“quality”	which	is	our	own,
the	great	theme	which	“life”	develops	by	making	it	integrate	and	transfigure	into
individual	significance	the	completeness	of	our	own	ever-receding	horizon.

So	 to	 educate	 man	 is	 the	 task	 of	 the	 new	 Psychology	 and	 of	 the	 new

Astrology	outlined	in	this	book.

### Dream-analysis	and	the	Assimilation	of	Unconscious	Contents

We	shall	refer	later	on	to	the	relationship	which	Astrology,	as	re-formulated
in	this	book,	bears	to	the	esthetical	attitude	to	life.	We	shall	particularly	see	how
this	attitude	invalidates	all	notions	of	“bad”	aspects	and	“evil”	planets,	at	least	in
natal	astrology.	But	 we	wish	 first	 of	 all	to	 conclude	 our	 brief	 survey	of	Jung’s
analytical	 psychology	 by	 outlining	 the	 method	 he	 advocates	 for	 furthering	 the
process	of	individuation.	It	will	be	indeed	a	most	sketchy	outline	and	we	must
refer	 the	 reader	 to	 Jung’s	 books,	 especially	 Two	 Essays	 on	 Analytical
Psychology,	 Modern	 Man	 in	 Search	 of	 a	 Soul,	 and	 the	 Commentary	 on	 The
Secret	of	the	Golden	Flower.

We	might	say	that	the	first	step	on	the	way	to	individuation	is	to	remove	the
impediments	 obstructing	 it.	 The	 process	 of	 individuation	 is	 no	 mysterious	 or
hallowed	 performance.	 It	 is	 the	 full	 living	 of	 an	 ethically	 and	 socially
uncastrated	life.	As	Jung	says:	“Life,	...	if	lived	with	complete	devotion,	brings
an	 intuition	 of	 the	 self,	 the	 individual	 being.”	 Unfortunately,	 to	 live	 with
complete	devotion	is	made	difficult	by	the	inheritance	of	mankind	which	makes
itself	 felt	 in	 the	 influence	 of	 environment,	 tradition	 and	 education.	 Collective
elements	press	upon	the	tender	sproutings	of	the	plant	of	personality;	and	so	the
natural	 flow	 of	 life	 is	 disturbed,	 hindered,	 and	 the	 very	 waters	 of	 the	 soul	 are
poisoned.	 The	 tendencies	 and	 energies	 repressed	 accumulate	 in	 the	 personal
unconscious,	 whence	 they	 affect	 in	 subterranean	 ways	 the	 outer	 behavior	 and
physiological	 health.	 Psychological	 analysis,	 in	 its	 first	 stage,	 must	 therefore
release	these	repressions;	the	repressed	wishes	must	be	made	conscious.

### Dream-analysis	helps	us	to	get	at	these	repressions	and	to	bring	them	into	the

light	of	consciousness,	thus	robbing	them	of	their	power.

“Dreams	give	information	about	the	secrets	of	the	inner	life	and	reveal	to
the	 dreamer	 hidden	 factors	 of	 his	 personality.	 As	 long	 as	 these	 are
undiscovered,	they	disturb	his	waking	life	and	betray	themselves	only	in	the
form	 of	 symptoms.	 This	 means	 that	 we	 cannot	 effectively	 treat	 the	 patient
from	the	side	of	consciousness	alone,	but	must	bring	about	a	change	in	and
through	the	unconscious.	As	far	as	present	knowledge	goes,	there	is	only	one
way	of	doing	this:	there	must	be	a	thoroughgoing,	conscious	assimilation	of
unconscious	contents.	By	‘assimilation,’	I	mean	a	mutual	interpenetration	of
conscious	and	unconscious	contents,	and	not—as	is	too	commonly	thought—
a	 one-sided	 valuation,	 interpretation	 and	 deformation	 of	 unconscious
contents	 by	 the	 conscious	 mind.	 .	 .	 .	 The	 relation	 between	 conscious	 and
unconscious	is	compensatory.	This	fact,	which	is	easily	verifiable,	affords	a

rule	 for	 dream	 interpretation.	 It	 is	 always	 helpful,	 when	 we	 set	 out	 to
interpret	 a	 dream,	 to	 ask:	 What	 conscious	 attitude	 does	 it	 compensate?	 .	 .	 .
Every	dream	is	a	source	of	information	and	a	means	of	self-regulation.	.	.	.
(Dreams)	 are	 our	 most	 effective	 aids	 in	 the	 task	 of	 building	 up	 the
personality.”

### (Modern	Man	in	Search	of	a	Soul,	pp.	18-20)

“The	dream	speaks	in	images,	and	gives	expression	to	instincts	that	are
derived	from	the	most	primitive	levels	of	nature.	Consciousness	all	too	easily
departs	from	the	law	of	nature;	but	it	can	be	brought	again	into	harmony	with
the	latter	by	assimilation	of	unconscious	contents.	By	fostering	this	process
we	lead	the	patient	to	the	rediscovery	of	the	law	of	his	own	being.	...	I	could
not	 put	 together	 (in	 so	 short	 a	 space)	 before	 your	 eyes,	 stone	 by	 stone,	 the
edifice	that	is	reared	in	every	analysis	from	the	materials	of	the	unconscious
and	finds	its	completion	in	the	restoration	of	the	total	personality.	The	way	of
successive	 assimilations	 reaches	 far	 beyond	 the	 curative	 results	 that
specifically	concern	the	doctor.	It	leads	in	the	end	to	that	distant	goal	(which
may	perhaps	have	been	the	first	urge	to	life)	the	bringing	into	reality	of	the
whole	human	being—	that	is,	individuation.”

### (Modern	Man	in	Search	of	a	Soul,	p.	30)

Dreams,	however,	are	not	the	only	projections	of	the	unconscious	which	can	be
assimilated.	There	is	another	field	of	psychological	activity,	which	Jung	names
“phantasy,”	 and	 which	 is	 rooted	 much	 more	 in	 the	 unconscious	 than	 in	 the
conscious.	 From	 the	 most	 inconspicuous	 day-dreaming	 to	 the	 most	 significant
sudden	 “inspiration”	 of	 the	 creative	 artist,	 the	 scientist,	 or	 the	 philosopher,	 the
realm	 of	 creative	 phantasy	 extends.	 Creative	 phantasy	 is	 the	 bridge	 between
feeling	and	thought.	“It	is	not	born	of	either,	for	it	is	the	mother	of	both—nay,
further,	 it	 is	 pregnant	 with	 the	 child,	 that	 final	 aim	 which	 reconciles	 the
opposites.	 .	 .	 .	 What	 great	 thing	 ever	 came	 into	 existence	 that	 was	 not	 first
phantasy?”	(Psychological	Types.)

Phantasy	 operates,	 like	 dreams,	 through	 the	 projection	 of	 symbols.	 By	 an
understanding	of	these	symbols	we	can	tap	the	deepest	levels	of	the	unconscious,
and	 assimilate	 the	 profound	 wisdom	 of	 the	 ages	 which	 is	 deposited	 at	 those
levels.

“The	unconscious	can	give	us	all	the	furtherance	and	help	that	bountiful
nature	holds	in	store	for	man	in	ever-flowing	abundance.	The	unconscious	.	.

The	 use	 of	 what	 is	 called	 “phantasy-material”	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 significant
features	of	Jung’s	technique.	He	writes:	“We	must	be	able	to	let	things	happen	in
the	 psyche.	 .	 .	 .	 Consciousness	 is	 forever	 interfering,	 helping,	 correcting	 and
negating,	and	never	leaving	the	simple	growth	of	the	psychic	process	in	peace.”
We	must	“release	the	cramp	in	the	conscious.”	A	new	attitude	is	to	be	created,
“an	attitude	which	accepts	the	irrational	and	the	unbelievable,	simply	because	it
is	 what	 is	 happening.	 This	 attitude	 would	 be	 a	 poison	 for	 a	 person	 who	 has
already	 been	 overwhelmed	 by	 things	 that	 just	 happen,	 but	 it	 is	 of	 the	 highest
value	 for	 one	 who,	 with	 an	 exclusively	 conscious	 critique,	 chooses	 from	 the
things	 that	 happen	 only	 those	 appropriate	 to	 his	 consciousness,	 and	 thus	 gets
gradually	drawn	away	from	the	stream	of	life	into	a	stagnant	backwater.”

### (Commentary	on	the	Secret	of	the	Golden	Flower,	p.	91)

The	“Commentary”	on	the	Secret	of	the	Golden	Flower	gives	a	great	deal	of
information	as	to	the	meaning	of	this	creative	phantasy	and	the	manner	in	which
the	 way	 can	 be	 cleared	 that	 leads	 to	 the	 condition	 of	 integration	 and
individuation.	It	shows,	besides,	how	the	modern	method	fits	in	with	some	of	the
oldest	 conceptions	 of	 Chinese	 wisdom,	 when	 these	 are	 seen	 as	 referring	 to
psychological	 processes—to	 the	 integration	 and	 birth	 of	 a	 superior	 personality,
the	consciousness	of	which,	detached	from	the	world,	which	it	contains	without
being	in	bondage	to	it,	has	become	pure	vision.

The	philosophical	motive	underlying	all	of	Jung’s	conceptions	is	that	of	the
reconciliation	of	the	opposites—an	old	and	universal	motive	which	Chinese	and
Aryan-Hindu	 civilizations	 featured,	 each	 in	 a	 somewhat	 different	 way,	 each
emphasizing	one	of	the	opposites.	The	Chinese	set-up	is	particularly	clear,	and
there	 is	 little	 doubt	 that,	 in	 a	 renewed	 formulation,	 it	 will	 gain	 an	 ever	 greater
ascendancy	in	the	new	era.	Through	Richard	Wilhelm,	Jung	became	intimately
acquainted	with	it	and	with	the	Yi	King,	the	great	book	in	which	ancient	China

pictured	 symbolically	 a	 wonderful	 synthesis	 of	 all	 life-activities,	 embracing	 all
knowledge	 and	 all	 performances	 of	 action	 in	 a	 vast	 formula,	 the	 Formula	 of
Change.

The	 application	 of	 the	 principle	 back	 of	 the	 formula	 in	 reference	 to
psychology	and	to	the	process	of	individuation	is	striking,	and,	in	a	deep	sense,
constitutes	the	background	of	Jung’s	conceptions	and	technique—consciously	or
unconsciously	to	him.	As	presented	in	The	Secret	of	the	Golden	Flower,	we	find
the	following	metaphysical	picture:

“Tao	 the	 undivided,	 Great	 One,	 gives	 rise	 to	 two	 opposite	 reality
principles,	 Darkness	 and	 Light,	 yin	and	yang.	 These	 are	 at	 first	 thought	 of
only	 as	 forces	 of	 nature,	 apart	 from	 man.	 Later	 the	 sexual	 polarities	 and
others	as	well,	are	derived	from	them.	From	yin	comes	ming,	life;	from	yang,
hsing	or	essence.”

Tao	 is	 “that	 which	 exists	 through	 itself,”	 paralleling	 thus	 the	 “Self-Existent”
(Svayambhuva)	 of	 Hindu	 Buddhism.	 But	 it	 is	 also	 the	 Great	 Integer	 and	 the
Process	of	 Integration.	The	Chinese	sign	for	Tao	is	 made	 up	 of	 two	 signs,	 one
meaning	“head,”	the	other,	“going.”	Wilhelm	translates	Tao	by	“Meaning”;	but	it
has	been	translated	usually	as	“the	Way.”	It	is,	in	one	sense	at	least,	the	Way,	or
rather	the	Process,	in	the	head.	Jung,	referring	“Head”	to	consciousness,	comes
to	 the	 meaning:	 conscious	 way.	 Tao	 is	 the	 synthesis	 of	 ming,	 life;	 and	 hsing,
essence.	 Essence	 and	 life,	 originally	 one	 in	 Tao,	 become	 separated	 at	 the
conception	 of	 the	 child.	 To	 reunite	 them	 is	 the	 goal	 of	 psychological
development.	Tao	becomes	thus	“the	method	or	conscious	way	by	which	to	unite
what	is	separated,”	that	is	essence	(which	is	interchangeable	with	consciousness)
and	life.	Consciousness	separated	from	life	refers	to	the	condition	Jung	describes
as	 “the	 deflection,	 or	 deracination	 of	 consciousness.”	 Also	 “the	 question	 of
making	the	opposites	conscious	means	reunion	with	the	laws	of	life	represented
in	the	unconscious.”	To	live	consciously	is	to	bring	about	Tao.	To	do	this	fully	is
to	 integrate	 consciousness	 (essence)	 and	 the	 energies	 of	 the	 collective
unconscious	(life).	This	comes	as	a	result	of	a	“psychic	process	of	development
which	 expresses	 itself	 in	 symbols.”	 The	 great	 symbol	 of	 individuation	 is	 the
mandala:	that	is,	a	magic	circle	containing	a	cross	or	some	other	basically	four-
fold	formation.

Such	 a	 symbol	 is	 the	 zodiac—and	 the	 typical	 quadrature	 of	 an	 astrological
chart	 (the	 4	 angles).	 All	 natal	 astrology	 is	 the	 practical	 application	 of	 this

“squaring	of	the	circle”—the	conscious	Way:	Tao.	Fourfold	T-A-0	gives	the	12
signs	or	houses	of	astrology	(3	X	4	=	12).	Every	birth-chart	is	the	mandala	of	an
individual	 life.	 It	 is	 the	 blue-print	 of	 the	 process	 of	 individuation	 for	 this
particular	 individual.	 To	 follow	 it	 understandingly	 is	 to	 follow	 the	 “conscious
way;”	the	way	of	“operative	wholeness;”	that	is,	the	way	of	the	active	fulfillment
of	the	wholeness	of	being	that	is	Self.

### ______________

*	 Printed	 in	 the	 book	 The	 Secret	 of	 the	 Golden	 Flower,	 a	 translation	 from	 the	 Chinese	 by	 Richard
Wilhelm.	with	a	commentary	by	C.	G.	Jung.	We	have	used	in	this	quotation	the	spelling	“Yi	King”	instead
of	“I	Ching”	to	fit	in	with	our	previous	use	of	the	term.

*	Space	is	the	abstract	mathematical	basis	of	reference	for	measuring	the	relationship	of	whole	to	whole
within	the	universal	Whole.	This	relationship	operates	through	the	interchange	of	“Light,”	or	energies,	and
is	 thus	 measurable	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 velocity	 of	 light—as	 in	 modern	 science.	 Space	 is	 thus,	 in	 a	 sense,
“created”	by	Light.	We	shall	see	later	on	that	it	corresponds	to	the	collective;	Time,	to	the	individual.	Space
is	 a	 framework	 for	 the	 operation	 of	 wholeness,	 the	 field	 created	 by	 the	 exteriorization,	 as	 Light,	 of
wholeness.	In	other	words,	Wholeness	exteriorizes	itself	as	Light.	Time	exteriorizes	itself	as	Space.	Thus
the	spatial	relationships	of	celestial	bodies	are	exteriorizations	or	symbols	of	the	qualities	of	moments	and
cycles.

*	In	this	and	other	unquoted	paragraphs	Jung	does	not	give	an	altogether	correct	picture	of	the	basis	of
the	symbolism	of	the	Yi	King.	The	Chinese	hexagrams	are	based	on	a	cosmic	formula	of	change.	Out	of	the
Unknown	Principle	arise	two	principles	Yang	and	Yin,	positive	and	negative,	expansive	and	contractive;	and
all	cycles	are	considered	as	the	time-symbols	of	the	interaction	of	these	two	principles.	They	are	particularly
related	to	the	cycles	of	the	year,	Yang	dominating	at	the	summer	solstice,	Yin,	at	the	winter	solstice.	Yang	is
represented	 by	 a	 straight	 line,	 Yin,	 by	 a	 line	 broken	 in	 two.	 The	 hexigrams	 constitute	 the	 64	 possible
combinations	 made	 by	 the	 six-fold	 superposition	 of	 these	 lines.	 Each	 is	 referred	 thus	 to	 a	 section	 of	 the
yearly	cycle,	and	carries	a	symbol	which	has	significance	in	terms	of	that	section.	Each	hexagram	is	thus	a
sort	 of	 zodiacal	 sign,	 or	 cosmic	 viewpoint	 measured	 on	 the	 circumference	 of	 the	 orbit	 of	 the	 Earth.	 The
symbols	themselves	were	apparently	written	down	by	King	Wen	around	the	year	1100	or	1000	B.C;	but	it
could	 undoubtedly	 be	 shown	 that	 their	 symbolism	 is	 based	 on	 “holistic	 logic,”	 just	 as	 astrological
symbolism.	Jung	is	too	much	of	an	experimentalist,	it	seems,	to	realize	this	fact.

*	The	term	“Analytic	Psychology”	was	used	as	the	title	of	a	book	by	G.	F.	Stout	(1896).	C.	G.	Jung	calls
his	type	of	psychology	“Analytical	Psychology.”	We	use	the	term	here	in	its	broadest	sense,	but	specifically
in	the	direction	of	Jung’s	interpretation—although	Dr.	Jung	would	presumably	disagree	with	much	that	we
say	in	this	chapter.

## INDIVIDUAL,	COLLECTIVE,	CREATIVE	AND	THE
## CYCLIC	PROCESS

At	the	close	of	the	last	chapter	we	referred	to	the	Yi	King	of	ancient	China	and	to
its	“Formula	of	Change”	based	on	the	interplay	of	the	two	cosmic	polarities	Yang
and	Yin.	As	already	mentioned,	such	a	formula	is	of	special	interest	to	us	because
it	had	obvious	astrological	origins.	Moreover	it	is	a	characteristic	expression	of	a
philosophy	of	time,	such	as	we	postulated	in	a	previous	chapter	as	the	necessary
background	 for	 any	 consistent	 and	 valid	 astrological	 thought.	 Astrology	 is
philosophically	 meaningless	 unless	 it	 rests	 on	 a	 thorough	 understanding	 of
cycles	 and	 of	 the	 creative	 potency	 of	 every	 moment—especially	 those	 “seed-
moments”	which	become	such	by	reason	of	their	being	the	points	of	departure	of
cycles.	 The	 “Formula	 of	 Change”	 of	 the	 Yi	 King	 is	 a	 cyclic	 formula,	 which
purports	 to	 determine	 symbolically	 the	 universal	 and	 essential	 structure	 of	 all
cycles;	better	still,	of	the	Cycle	or	of	cyclicity.	As	all	life-processes	are	cyclic—
in	essence,	if	not	in	outer	appearance—such	a	formula	becomes	the	basic	law	of
all	 life-processes.	 Thus	 a	 truly	 universal	 synthesis	 of	 being	 and	 becoming	 is
reached—a	 synthesis	 probably	 grander	 and	 more	 absolute,	 in	 its	 symbolical
applicability,	 than	 that	 contemplated	 by	 Einstein	 through	 his	 “unified	 field
theory”	reducing	all	natural	phenomena	to	a	simple	law.

The	Chinese	formula	is	not	unique	in	the	history	of	human	thought.	We	shall
see	 presently	 that	 the	 old	 Hindu	 civilization	 also	 had	 conceived	 a	 universal
synthesis	of	 knowledge	which	could	 be	 expressed	in	terms	of	a	cyclic	formula
defining	the	universal	life-process	whose	poles	are	being	and	becoming.	And	we
claim	that	the	new	civilization,	now	slowly	in	the	making,	will	also	evolve	such
a	 formula	 on	 a	 new	 basis	 of	 life-analysis	 and	 at	 a	 new	 level	 of	 mental
functioning.

The	discussion	of	such	matters	obviously	goes	far	beyond	the	scope	of	this
book;	 and	 yet	 we	 find	 ourselves	 obliged	 to	 outline	 them	 briefly,	 because	 the

values	on	which	the	new	formula	of	the	cycle	is	based	are-—in	our	estimation—
the	very	factors	upon	which	our	classification	and	interpretation	of	astrological
elements	 will	 depend.	 The	 old	 Chinese	 dualism	 of	 cosmic	 polarities	 does	 not
suffice	to	interpret	our	modern	approach	to	being	and	becoming.	As	already	said,
humanity	is	establishing	its	consciousness,	slowly	but	steadily,	at	a	new	mental
level;	and	therefore	it	contemplates	the	universal	life-process	from	another	point
of	 vantage.	 New	 values	 must	 therefore	 be	 determined:	 values	 which	 do	 not,
however,	 negate	 either	 the	 old	 Chinese	 or	 Hindu	 ones,	 but	 which	 complement
and	supplement	them—Western	values,	which	presumably	will	flower	upon	the
American	continent,	the	seat	of	an	emerging	civilization.

In	 outlining	 the	 new	 cyclic	 formula	 we	 shall	 have	 merely	 to	 state	 ideas,
rather	than	discuss	them	in	relation	to	other	more	traditional	points	of	view.	Our
aim	 is	 not	 to	 write	 a	 philosophical	 treatise,	 but	 merely	 to	 establish	 a
philosophical	 background	 to	 astrology.	 The	 new	 philosophy	 of	 Time,	 or	 of	 the
Cycle,	 is	 yet	 to	 be	 written.	 The	 following	 will	 be	 a	 mere	 suggestion	 of	 its
existence	and	a	mere	sketch	of	those	of	its	aspects	which	refer	more	especially	to
psychology	and	astrology.

### The	Cycle:	from	Seed	to	Seed

Every	cycle	can	be	interpreted	structurally	as	being	composed	of	beginning,
middle	 and	 end.	 These	 three	 terms,	 however,	 are	 to	 be	 understood	 in	 a
metaphysical	 sense	 rather	 than	 in	 the	 sense	 of	 values	 of	 time.	 They	 represent
three	essential	factors	or	principles	which	constitute	in	their	trinity	the	wholeness
of	 the	 cycle.	 The	 simplest	 way	 of	 approaching	 a	 complex	 subject	 will	 be	 to
examine	successively	each	of	these	three	terms	and	to	determine	what	it	refers
to,	in	a	general	sense.

BEGINNING.	 The	 beginning	 of	 every	 cycle	 is	 a	 One:	 a	 monad.	 By	 definition
we	shall	say	that	a	monad	is	the	initial	point	of	emanation	of	any	life-cycle.	It	is
the	germinating	seed,	or	that	point	within	the	seed	whence	arise	root	and	stem.
The	beginning	of	the	cycle	is	the	moment	of	unity,	the	moment	which	reveals	the
actual	 presence	 of	 the	 One.	 Absolute	 unity	 is	 a	 postulate,	 a	 desideratum,	 an
abstract	 goal,	 a	 metaphysical	 concept.	 It	 is	 incompatible	 with	 life	 or
manifestation.	 But	 the	 One-that-is-in-the-beginning	 is	 a	 representation	 of	 this
abstract	 and	 metaphysical	 unity—an	 avatar	 thereof.	 Unity	 can	 be	 reached	 in
consciousness	 by	 devotion	 to	 this	 One—the	 Father-Mother	 of	 the	 whole	 cycle.
Devotion	is	concentration	upon	the	One—as	if	this	One	existed.

Actually	the	One	does	no	longer	“ex-ist”	as	a	manifested	Father;	but	the	One
is	as	a	psychological	reality	in	the	memory	of	those	of	His	sons	who	become	the
bearers	of	His	integrative	power—the	hypostases,	or	avatars,	of	this	power.	This
power	 is	 Tao,	 and,	 in	 another	 sense,	 it	 is	 the	 AUM	 of	 the	 Hindus.	 It	 is	 the
integrative	 power	 which	 is	 Life	 itself;	 and	 which	 alone	 makes	 possible	 the
process	 of	 integration	 or	 individuation	 spoken	 of	 in	 our	 last	 chapter.	 In	 the
human	physiological	organism	 this	power	is	that	of	blood-circulation	rooted	 in
the	heart;	in	the	human	psyche	this	power	is	less	well	defined,	for	the	psyche	is
in	most	persons	far	from	being	as	yet	an	“organism.”	But	it	is	the	power	which
may	be	called	the	will	to	wholeness	or	the	will	to	sanity	and	health,	with	which
the	psychologist	must	deal	if	his	analysis	is	to	lead	the	patient	to	psychological
health	and	eventually	to	individuation.

He,	therefore,	 who	worships	the	One	 as	 a	form	or	entity,	as	the	All-Father,
worships	 actually	 a	 memory,	 the	 most	 primordial	 of	 all	 “primordial	 images.”
This	 worship	 keeps	 the	 memory	 alive	 and	 offers	 channels	 through	 which	 the
energy	of	this	One	can	flow.	The	One	is	no	longer	there,	just	as	the	seed	is	no
longer	existent	in	the	growing	tree.	But	the	power	of	growth	that	was	in	the	seed
is	 active	 throughout	 the	 cycle	 of	 the	 plant’s	 manifestation.	 This	 power	 is	 an
integrative	force	which	constantly	“bears	witness”	to	the	one	Seed.

In	other	words,	once	the	period	of	germination	is	ended,	the	seed	disappears,
having	sacrificed	itself	so	that	the	plant	might	be.	But	the	energy	that	was	in	the
seed	 keeps	 operating.	 It	 is	 the	 power	 of	 operative	 wholeness.	 The	 One,	 having
ceased	to	be	a	manifested	entity,	has	now	become	a	process.

MIDDLE.	 This	 “process”	 is	 the	 fundamental	 reality	 of	 the	 “middle”	 of	 the
cycle.	 By	 the	 term	 “middle,”	 however,	 must	 be	 understood	 the	 whole	 of	 the
becoming:	The	 entire	series	of	moments	that	occur	 between	the	initial	moment
of	 emanation	 and	 the	 final	 moment	 of	 consummation.	 These	 two	 moments	 (of
emanation	 and	 consummation)	 are	 in	 a	 sense	 unique;	 they	 constitute	 the	 alpha
and	 the	 omega	 of	 manifestation—or	 rather	 they	 represent	 the	 two	 aspects	 of
being,	the	two	aspects	of	the	One.	As	D.	H.	Lawrence	once	wrote	in	an	inspired
article,	they	are	the	God-of-the-beginning	and	the	God-of-the-end.	In	The	Secret
Doctrine,	H.	P.	Blavatsky	refers	to	these	two	“Gods”—that	are	one	in	essense—
respectively	 as	 the	 Root-Manu	 and	 the	 Seed-Manu.	 Outside	 of	 them,	 all	 else
belongs	to	the	process	of	change,	to	the	flux	of	becoming;	that	is,	to	that	which
men	today	call	“life”—the	series	of	activities	which	constitute	living.

### However,	throughout	this	process	of	change	a	power	of	integration	is	more

or	 less	 evident:	 a	 power	 that	 gives	 cohesion	 and	 direction	 to	 the	 multitudinous
transformations	 of	 the	 becoming.	 This	 power	 is	 the	 energy	 of	 the	 Father,	 the
Holy	Ghost,	the	Comforter.	It	is	the	Life-force	that	integrates	all	the	multiplicity
of	parts	into	organic	wholes.	It	is	the	power	of	“holism.”

END.	 The	 moment	 of	 consummation	 of	 the	 cycle	 is	 a	 moment	 of
concentration,	 conclusion	 and	 in-gathering	 of	 the	 fruits	 of	 the	 process	 of
manifestation.	It	is	the	“Day-Be-with-Us”	of	the	occultists,	the	Seventh-Day.	As
this	 moment	 of	 consummation	 is	 reached,	 all	 the	 forces	 which	 were	 the
differentiated	 streams	 which	 issued	 from	 the	 Original	 Source	 (or	 Monad)	 and
which	animated	the	many	Sons	of	the	one	Father,	become	gathered	in	a	vortex	of
power	 and	 light	 which	 constitutes	 the	 creative	 reality	 of	 the	 God-of-the-end—
creative,	 because	 this	 God	 will	 become	 in	 turn,	 by	 imaging	 Himself	 forth,	 the
Creator	of	the	new	Cycle’s	“archetypes”	or	generic	Forms.

Though	such	a	characterization	of	the	three	basic	terms	of	the	Cycle	is	most
incomplete,	 it	 will	 at	 any	 rate	 help	 us	 to	 define	 the	 three	 fundamental	 world-
viewpoints	 which	 gave	 and	 are	 to	 give	 rise	 to	 three	 equally	 fundamental
formulas	 of	 being	 and	 becoming.	 Each	 world-viewpoint	 and	 its	 formula
emphasizes	one	of	the	three	terms	of	the	Cycle—an	emphasis	which	of	course
does	 not	 negate	 the	 other	 two	 terms	 but	 which	 either	 leaves	 them	 in	 the
background	 or	 gives	 to	 them	 a	 more	 or	 less	 subaltern,	 or	 negative,	 or	 illusory
valuation.	 The	 two	 first	 types	 of	 emphasis,	 stressing	 the	 “beginning”	 and	 the
“middle”	of	the	Cycle—the	original	One	and	the	process	of	becoming—are	well
known	to	mankind.	The	former	is	typical	of	the	old	Hindu	civilization,	and	of	all
religious	and	spiritual	movements	which	are	more	or	less	dependent	upon	the	old
Aryan	 tradition.	 The	 latter	 received	 a	 characteristic	 formulation	 in	 the	 old
Chinese	 civilization,	 and	 is	 also	 exemplified	 by	 the	 largest	 part	 of	 the
philosophical-psychological	 and	 scientific	 thought	 of	 the	 twentieth	 century.	 A
third	type	of	emphasis-stressing	the	value	of	consummation	and	the	end-term	of
the	 Cycle—is	 slowly	 emerging	 from	 the	 general	 body	 of	 modern	 thought.	 It	 is
such	 a	 type	 of	 emphasis	 that	 we	 shall	 attempt	 to	 characterize	 in	 a	 new	 cyclic
formula.

### The	Aryan-Hindu	Formula

India	 represents	 typically	 (but	 of	 course	 not	 exclusively)	 the	 attitude	 of
devotion;	 that	 is,	 the	 dependence	 upon	 the	 One-that-is-in-the-beginning.	 It
stresses—in	 many	 ways—the	 First	 Principle,	 the	 alpha	 of	 evolution	 and	 the

yearning	toward	absolute	Unity.	The	fact	that	there	existed	in	India	a	universal
synthesis	of	knowledge	is	not	always	recognized;	but	it	can	be	discovered	in	the
great	 days	 of	 the	 old	 Aryavarta,	 of	 Aryan	 civilization,	 underneath	 the	 many
accretions	and	perversions	which	have	marred	the	pure	beauty	and	simplicity	of
the	 ancient	 system,	 long	 antedating	 Buddhism—just	 as	 the	 Yi	 King	 long
antedated	 Confucianism.	 This	 system	 seems	 to	 have	 been	 recovered,	 in	 part	 at
least,	in	a	somewhat	mysterious	way,	by	Bhagavan	Das,	and	we	refer	the	student
to	his	great	work,	the	Pranava	Veda.

### the	 world-process	 derived	 from

India’s	 integration,	 being	 based	 on	 the	 original	 One,	 is	 essentially
hierarchical—much	 more	 so	 than	 China’s,	 which	 is	 equilibrative.	 All	 activity
and	knowledge	are	seen	in	their	root-relationship	to	the	triune	One,	which	is	the
the	 absolute	 unknowable	 and
## AUM,
incomprehensible	Unity.	In	AUM,	A	stands	for	the	universal	monad,	 U	for	the
world	of	illusion,	M	for	the	relation	between	both.	This	relation	is	a	relation	of
negation.	For	the	old	Hindu	wisdom,	based	on	the	One,	denies	the	Many	except
as	a	shadowy	objectivication	of	this	One.

Thus	the	formula	of	the	world-process	is	given	as:	“The	Self	—is	not—the
Not-Self.”	 The	 formula	 of	 knowledge	 is	 that	 the	 object	 (Not-Self)	 must	 be
known	so	that	the	subject	(Self)	realizes	by	seeing	the	illusory	character	thereof
that	 there	 is	 nothing	 but	 the	 subject.	 The	 integration	 is	 reached	 by	 denial	 and
renunciation.	 The	 world-process	 is	 seen	 as	 an	 illusion	 (maya).	The	 personality
and	 change	 are	 illusions;	 and	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 cycle,	 the	 original	 One	 finds
himself	 again	 what	 he	 originally	 was—	 uncorrupted	 by	 change.	 What	 has	 he
gained	through	the	process	of	change?	This,	that	he	now	knows	consciously	that
“I	 am	 that	 I	 am.”	 Thus	 consciousness	 is	 the	 end	 of	 the	 process,	 but	 a
consciousness	which	identifies	itself	completely	with	the	subject	and	withdraws
from	the	object	all	reality.	However,	all	fire	leaves	ashes;	and	so	a	new	cycle	is
necessary	to	reincorporate	these	ashes	into	a	new	living	and	growing	tree.	Thus
the	world-process	goes	on	endlessly	through	incarnation	after	incarnation	of	the
same	 Self.	 Time	 becomes	 thus	 the	 fatality	 of	 being—the	 warp	 and	 woof	 of
karma	and	of	misery.

This	 basic	 attitude	 to	 life	 follows	 necessarily	 a	 strong	 emphasis	 upon	 the
One-that-is-in-the-beginning.	 For	 this	 One,	 the	 “process”	 of	 the	 middle	 cycle
means	 dismemberment,	 tragedy—or	 sacrifice.	 The	 end	 means	 return	 to	 the
integrity	of	the	beginning.	Thus	the	AUM:	which	is	to	be	repeated	in	succession;
for	 the	 M	 is	 cessation,	 deliverance.	 But	 it	 brings	 again	 re-birth.	 And	 the	 true
AUM	is	the	inaudible	one;	truth	residing	in	withdrawal	and	abstraction.	A	and	U

are	also	sounded	as	O	to	show	that	the	distinction	between	self	and	not-self	is	a
mere	 concept,	 an	 illusion.	 Thus	 OM	 is	 the	 integrated	 tone—the	 simplest	 vocal
sound:	exhaling	of	air	and	closing	of	lips.	A	true	symbol	of	the	One	 without	a
second.

The	 synthesis	 of	 universal	 knowledge	 and	 activity	 followed	 upon	 such
concepts.	Out	of	the	OM	emanated	the	Gayatri,	the	sacred	invocation	to	the	Sun
and	 the	 unity	 of	 all	 life.	 From	 the	 Gayatri,	 and	 some	 other	 basic	 mantrams,
issued	 forth	 the	 four	 Vedas;	 from	 the	 Vedas	 came	 the	 Vedantas;	 from	 those,
representing	 the	 basic	 sciences	 of	 the	 self,	 originated	 the	 six	 schools	 of	 Hindu
philosophy,	 synthetized	 at
the	 secret	 seventh—Atma-Vidya—the
consciousness	of	the	“end,”	leading	to	the	reutterance	of	the	AUM	in	a	universal
way.	 All	 of	 this	 is	 but	 a	 most	 sketchy	 outline	 of	 one	 of	 the	 basic	 systems	 of
consciousness	 of	 mankind,	 a	 system	 which	 is	 still	 the	 foundation	 of	 most
religions	and	of	most	types	of	occult	philosophies.

### The	Chinese	Formula

This	 system	 is	 of	 course	 fundamentally	 different	 from	 the	 Chinese	 system,
which	emphasizes	the	reality	of	the	“process”	and	the	dualism	involved	therein.
Yang	and	Yin,	the	two	cosmic	polarities,	are	seen	in	their	cyclic	interplay.	Time
is	no	longer	the	fatality	that	forces	the	spirit	into	reincarnation,	but	is	the	basic
reality	of	the	process	of	change.	All	life	is	a	ritual	of	change,	a	drama	picturing
the	 related	 activities	 of	 Yang	 and	 Yin,	 and	 featuring	 their	 successive
permutations.	 These	 permutations	 are	 symbolized	 geometrically,	 first	 in	 a
threefold	 scheme	 of	 archetypal	 manifestation	 (for	 every	 relation	 between	 two
elements	 involves	 action,	 reaction	 and	 interaction);	 then	 in	 a	 sixfold	 realm	 of
activity,	 which	 is	 the	 realm	 of	 actual	 drama	 or	 outer	 performance.	 Thus	 64
hexagrams	 are	 formed,	 representing	 all	 the	 possible	 phases	 of	 interaction
between	the	two	principles	in	the	six-fold	realm	of	activity.	These	hexagrams	are
then	 distributed	 in	 a	 circle,	 very	 much	 as	 the	 signs	 of	 the	 zodiac	 in	 modern
astrology.

What	this	cyclic	series	of	hexagrams	represents	is	the	universal	drama	of	life,
the	cosmic	pattern	of	all	activity	and	of	all	reaction	to	activity	(which	is	what	we
call	 knowledge).	 More	 specifically,	 it	 stands	 as	 the	 graph	 of	 the	 changing
relationship	 of	 Sun	 to	 Earth	 during	 the	 cycle	 of	 the	 year.	 But	 this	 relationship,
which	curves	along	the	path	of	the	Earth’s	orbit,	is	in	fact	the	very	origin	of	the
vital	principle	in	everything.	Life	does	not	come	from	the	Sun.	Life	is	the	result
of	 the	 enacted	 relationship	 between	 Sun	 and	 Earth,	 between	 energy	 and

substance,	between	Light	and	Darkness.

At	 the	 summer	 solstice,	 Yang	dominates;	 at	 the	 winter	 solstice,	 Yin;	 at	 the
equinoxes,	 they	 are	 in	 a	 state	 of	 dynamic	 equilibrium.	 But	 in	 the	 Fall,	 Yin
increases;	 while	 in	 the	 Spring,	 Yang	 increases	 and	 Yin	 decreases	 in	 intensity.
Thus	 four	 crucial	 points,	 the	 Cross	 of	 activity,	 the	 Four	 Acts	 of	 the	 drama—
which	 a	 Fifth	 Act	 may,	 or	 may	 not,	 synthetize.	 This	 Fifth	 Act	 is	 the
“Quintessence,”	 of	 alchemical	 lore.	 It	 is	 the	 Fifth	 Limb—the	 house	 of	 the
Creative,	 whether	 above	 or	 below.	 It	 is	 the	 sacred	 place	 where	 dwells	 Tao,	 the
Great	Meaning,	the	apex	of	the	pyramid	based	on	the	four	crucial	points	of	the
year,	the	Symbol	of	all	symbols.	Tao	is	the	solution	of	all	conflicts;	and	therefore
it	is	not	a	thing	or	even	an	essence,	but	a	process.	It	is	the	Process	in	the	Head;
the	going	of	the	Initiate	up	the	steps	that	lead	to	the	top	of	the	pyramid—a	flat
top,	originally,	for	the	apex	itself	could	only	be	the	mystic	Fire	rising	from	the
exalted	 altar;	 the	 altar	 where	 the	 Four	 Errors	 (which	 are	 really	 limited
viewpoints)	are	burnt	and	are	solved,	resolved,	integrated	into	the	One	Meaning.
This	One	Meaning,	resolving	all	conflicts	by	equilibrating	and	transcending
them,	 is	 embodied	 in	 the	 Chinese	 Emperor.	 He	 is	 the	 neutral	 point	 where	 all
cosmic	 energies	 are	 balanced,	 the	 Great	 Empty,	 the	 hub	 of	 the	 wheel.	 This,
within	 the	 State.	 But,	 for	 the	 mystic,	 there	 was	 potentially	 in	 every	 man	 an
“imperial	palace.”	There,	within	the	head,	Tao	reached	completion	as	a	process,
the	process	of	“circulation	of	the	Light,”	and	the	“Diamond	Body”	was	born—
the	Emperor:	the	God-of-the-end,	the	Light-Seed.

The	word	Tao	can	be	symbolically	analyzed	so	that	each	of	its	three	letters
refers	to	one	term	of	the	Cycle.	A	refers	to	the	One-that-is-in-the-beginning,	the
monad;	O	connotes	the	ultimate	consummation	which	in	man	means	integrated
Personality	centered	around	the	Self	(and	not	only	the	merely	conscious	ego)	—
and,	at	a	later	stage	of	abstraction,	the	quintessence	of	Selfhood;	and	T	stands	for
the	world-process	of	change—in	man,	for	that	state	of	being	which	is	a	continual
flux	 of	 thoughts,	 feelings,	 intuitions	 and	 sensations;	 the	 state	 of	 the	 evolving
ever-changing	personality.	The	letter	T	came	first,	in	this	sacred	word	of	China,
because	Chinese	civilization	emphasized	the	element	of	“process”;	and	the	letter
T,	in	universal	symbology,	signifies	the	life-power	that	flows	through	the	process
of	 becoming,	 the	 power	 born	 of	 the	 “crucifixion”	 of	 the	 One	 into	 the	 realm	 of
duality.	 However,	 this	 life-power,	 when	 controlled	 by	 man	 in	 equilibrium	 of
action,	becomes	the	energy	that	leads	inward	along	the	“Conscious	way”	which
is	Tao.

Thus	 the	 goal	 of	 the	 Sage	 was	 to	 equilibrate	 within	 himself	 the	 opposite
polarities,	 to	 reach	 a	 point	 of	 balance	 from	 which	 all	 conflicts	 could	 be
symbolically	resolved	through	objectivizing	and	transcending	them,	and	to	draw
within	the	creative	center	of	his	ultimate	selfhood	the	quintessence	of	the	entire
process	of	change	so	as	to	build	therewith	the	spiritual	vehicle	for	a	relative	type
of	indivudual	immortality	as	one	of	the	true	“Celestials”	—i.e.,	as	the	spiritual
manifestation	of	one	of	the	archetypal	Principles	within	the	realm	of	Universals.

### The	“New	World”	Formula

Thus	 the	 Chinese	 and	 the	 Hindu	 Weltanschauungen,	 or	 world-viewpoints.
We	 claim	 that	 a	 third	 type	 of	 universal	 integration	 is	 possible,	 which	 would
emphasize	 neither	 the	 One-in-the-beginning,	 nor	 the	 “process”	 which	 we	 call
“life”—but	 the	 ultimate	 sum	 total,	 the	 con-summation,	 the	 ingathering	 of	 all
elements	 within	 the	 “circle	 of	 wholeness.”	 Such	 a	 system	 would	 obviously
integrate	some	of	the	features	of	the	Chinese	and	the	Hindu	typical	philosophies.
It	 would,	 moreover,	 incorporate	 the	 particular	 stress	 laid	 by	 Christianity	 upon
“personality”	and	the	process	of	crucifixion—a	stress	seemingly	absent	from	the
Chinese	 system.	 Finally,	 it	 would	 have	 to	 give	 hospitality	 to	 the	 new	 scientific
mentality,	insofar	as	it	involves	a	critical	and	analytical	approach	to	the	world	of
natural	 phenomena,	 and	 an	 attempt	 at	 thus	 deepening	 the	 understanding	 of	 the
process	of	change.

Such	 a	 system,	 such	 an	 attitude	 to	 life,	 is	 slowly	 in	 the	 making	 under	 our
very	eyes.	It	lacks	only	some	basic	coordinating	factors,	a	larger	vision	free	from
European	 bias,	 a	 truly	 esthetical	 and	 creative	 temperament—and	 a	 collective
spiritual	impulsion	which	even	now	may	be	gathering	its	momentum	out	of	the
collapse	of	the	old	European	civilization.	To	the	building	of	such	a	new	world-
viewpoint	pioneers	in	practically	all	spheres	of	human	activity	are	contributing.
Perhaps	the	term	“Holism”	is	as	good	as	any	to	characterize	this	new	attitude	to
life,	if	the	meaning	of	the	term	is	broadened	beyond	General	Smuts’	definition.
We	 have	 used	 the	 phrase	 “philosophy	 of	 operative	 wholeness.”	 We	 defined	 in
our	last	chapter	the	truly	“esthetical”	approach	to	life	and	its	relation	to	the	new
psychology,	especially	as	formulated	by	Jung.	We	touched	in	an	earlier	chapter
upon	the	new	attitude	of	science,	whose	findings	will	do	perhaps	more	than	any
other	 factor	 toward	 establishing	 the	 new	 philosophy	 of	 living	 and	 being.	 We
must	 mention	 not	 only	 those	 movements	 in	 the	 field	 of	 social	 organization,
politics	and	jurisprudence	which	stammer	the	first	sentences	of	the	new	human
language,	 but	 above	 all,	 the	 momentous	 pressure	 of	 economic	 factors,	 the

influence	 of	 our	 machines	 and	 our	 technology,	 which	 will	 be	 the	 practical
determining	factor	of	material	changes.

Then,	there	is	the	new	religious	consciousness	and	the	power	of	movements
which	 deal	 with	 occultism	 and	 mysticism—even	 spiritualism.	 In	 Alice	 A.
Bailey’s	 books	 the	 characteristics	 of	 the	 new	 type	 of	 consciousness,	 emerging
here	and	there	everywhere,	and	the	broadest	implications	of	the	idea	of	group-
work	on	a	world-wide	basis,	are	stated	with	unimpeachable	clarity.	Her	study	of
the	 activities	 of	 what	 she	 calls	 the	 New	 Group	 of	 World-Servers,	 even	 though
made	on	the	basis	of	occult	ideas	which	may	disconcert	not	a	few,	is	a	masterly
expression	of	a	vision	which	encompasses	the	whole	of	mankind.

What	is	needed,	however,	is	a	simple	symbolic	presentation	of	life-principles
such	as	we	find	in	the	old	Yi	King:	a	general	formula	which	relates,	centers	and
crystallizes	 all	 the	 new	 ideas	 and	 ideals;	 which	 brings	 to	 formulation	 in	 a	 new
and	significant	manner	the	basic	forces	which	in	every	field	seek	a	new	type	of
adjustment.	 Realizing	 the	 apparent	 magnitude	 of	 the	 task,	 it	 would	 seem
presumptuous	 even	 to	 attempt	 it.	 Yet	 what	 is	 more	 simple	 than	 the	 basic
principles	 of	 the	 Yi	 King?	 Our	 civilization	 is	 overburdened	 with	 complexities.
What	 it	 needs	 is	 a	 few	 simple	 and	 synthetizing	 ideas,	 which	 at	 last	 can
structurally	 co-ordinate	 the	 bewildering	 maze	 of	 our	 intellectual	 knowledge.	 It
needs	one,	or	a	few,	significant	symbols	to	integrate	the	whole	mass	of	materials,
data	and	sciences	which	are	crowding	our	encyclopedias.	Can	such	be	found,	at
this	 present	 moment?	 It	 is	 hard	 to	 say.	 But	 we	 may	 at	 any	 rate	 contribute	 a
suggestion	 toward	 the	 eventual	 solution.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 following
concepts	will	be	of	essential	value	to	us	in	determining	the	bases	of	astrological
symbolism.	And	let	us	not	forget,	astrological	symbolism,	as	symbolism,	may	yet
play	 a	 most	 important	 part	 in	 making	 concrete	 and	 intelligible	 some	 of	 the
deepest	ideas	involved	in	the	philosophy	of	the	new	civilization.

### Individual	and	Collective

All	 manifestations	 of	 life	 can	 be	 seen	 to	 involve	 a	 dualism	 of	 elements	 or
tendencies.	 Where	 the	 Chinese	 spoke	 of	 Yang	and	Yin	 we	 shall	 use	 the	 terms:
“individual”	 and	 “collective”;	 and	 we	 shall	 presently	 see	 that	 this	 dualism	 is
resolved	 through	 the	 operation	 of	 a	 third	 principle:	 the	 “creative.”	 The	 words
themselves,	 of	 course,	 are	 not	 new.	 They	 have	 been	 used	 especially	 in
psychology	 and	 in	 relation	 to	 social	 organization,	 politics—and	 even,	 of	 late,
have	 been	 implied	 in	 the	 recent	 theories	 of	 modern	 physics	 (especially	 in	 the
dualism	 of	 “particle”	 and	 “wave”).	 What,	 however,	 has	 not	 yet	 been	 done—as

far	as	we	know—is	to	use	these	basic	concepts	in	an	attempt	at	integrating	the
whole	of	human	knowledge	and	 at	offering	a	consistent	 interpretation	of	being
and	 becoming.	 Again,	 we	 must	 repeat	 that	 we	 are	 here	 barely	 suggesting	 how
such	an	attempt	could	be	made,	and	this	in	order	to	establish	our	re-interpretation
of	astrological	symbols	on	a	foundation	truly	all-inclusive	in	its	scope.

The	philosophy	of	Holism,	to	which	General	Smuts	gave	a	most	interesting
though	not	by	any	means	complete	formulation,	will	help	us	greatly	in	showing
how	 the	 evolutionary	 life-process	 and	 its	 contributive	 factors	 can	 be	 re-
interpreted	in	a	way	that	is	true	to	the	spirit	of	the	future	civilization.	Whole	and
parts	are	presented	as	the	two	terms	of	the	life-process.	And	the	introduction	of
these	two	terms	as	cosmic	ultimates	is	a	tremendous	step—even	though	General
Smuts	appears	somewhat	shy	of	truly	metaphysical	and	cosmic	generalizations.
However,	he	characterizes	the	nature	of	the	World-process	thus:

“This	 is	 a	 universe	 of	 whole-making.	 .	 .	 .	 The	 ultimate	 reality	 of	 the
universe	 is	 neither	 matter	 nor	 spirit	 but	 wholes.	 .	 .	 .	 Holism	 as	 an	 active
creative	process	means	the	movement	of	the	universe	towards	ever	more	and
deeper	wholeness.	This	is	the	essential	process,	and	all	organic	and	psychic
activities	and	relations	have	to	be	understood	as	elements	and	forms	of	this
process.	.	.	.	The	rise	and	self-protection	of	wholes	in	the	Whole	is	the	slow
but	unerring	process	and	goal	of	this	Holistic	universe.”

### (Holism	and	Evolution,	1926)

Such	 a	 picture,	 when	 completed	 by	 the	 idea	 that	 soul	 or	 self	 must	 be
understood	 as	 the	 wholeness	 of	 the	 wholes	 (cf.	 Chapter	 2),	 constitutes	 a
revolutionary	 revaluation	 of	 man’s	 attitude	 to	 life.	 The	 dualism	 of	 spirit	 and
matter,	which	was	another	form	of	physiological	dualism,	as	it	meant	originally
that	 of	 motion	 and	 inertia,	 is	 replaced	 by	 that	 of	 wholeness	 and	 parts.	 And	 the
unity	of	the	process	is	stressed	in	that	“Holism	is	a	process	of	creative	synthesis	.
.	.	the	movement	of	the	universe	towards	ever	more	and	deeper	wholeness.”

We	cannot	here	thoroughly	discuss	the	metaphysical	implications	and	some
of	the	metaphysical	weaknesses	of	the	picture	General	Smuts	presents.	All	that
we	may	say	is	that	in	such	an	idea	of	infinite	progression,	apparently	from	chaos
to	perfect	wholeness,	as	well	as	in	the	opposite	idea,	held	by	many	contemporary
scientists,	 of	 a	 universe	 running	 down	 to	 a	 neutral	 level,	 we	 find	 lacking	 a
conception	of	the	cyclic	nature	of	time,	and	of	the	relation	of	time	to	wholeness.
We	 do	 not	 see	 how	 a	 formula	 of	 universal	 integration	 can	 have	 real	 validity

unless	it	is	cyclic	—unless	the	beginning	and	the	end,	as	it	were,	meet;	and	that
point	of	meeting	can	be	considered	as	absolute	and	timeless—the	Eternal	Now.

In	 other	 words:	 1)	 the	 life-process	 is	 not	 a	 mere	 progression	 upward;	 2)	 it
involves	two	complementary	motions	which,	seen	separately,	operate	in	opposite
directions;	 yet	 which	 can	 be	 integrated	 into	 a	 third	 term.	 This	 term	 is	 not	 a
motion.	There	is	no	progress	involved	in	it.

### The	first	motion	can	be	termed	“individuation”—provided	the	word	is	taken

in	a	much	more	general	sense	than	the	one	given	to	it	by	Jung.

The	second	motion	can	be	termed	“collectivation.”
The	 third	 term	 is	 “the	 creative.”	 The	 crux	 of	 the	 whole	 matter	 lies	 in	 the
correct	 understanding	 of	 this	 third	 term.	 To	 grasp	 the	 somewhat	 difficult
significance	of	it,	we	shall	have	to	see	how	the	two	motions	which	it	synthetizes
and	equilibrates	operate.

Individuation.	 This	 is	 the	 process	 through	 which	 elements,	 which	 are
relatively	 unrelated	 (absolute	 unrelatedness	 being	 inconceivable),	 gather	 or	 are
gathered	 together	 and	 constitute	 a	 whole.	 So	 defined,	 the	 term	 is	 synonymous
with	“integration.”

Collectivation.	 This	 is	 the	 process	 through	 which	 characteristic	 features,
faculties	 or	 energies	 which	 had	 been	 acquired	 by	 individuals	 as	 individuals
become	by	direct	or	indirect	transmission	the	property	of	groups.

In	order	to	grasp	these	definitions	clearly	it	will	be	necessary	to	analyze	the
two	concepts	philosophically—individual	and	collective—and	thus	to	get	a	well-
defined	picture	of	what	these	terms,	often	loosely	used,	signify.

An	 individual	 is	 an	 entity	 in	 which	 are	 integrated	 in	 a	 unique	 manner	 a
number	 of	 elements.	 These	 elements	 are	 inherited	 from	 the	 linear	 ancestors	 of
that	individual,	or	assimilated	by	him	in	one	way	or	another	since	he	began	to
exist	in	a	state	of	relative	independence.	What	constitutes	individualhood	is	the
fact	 that	 the	 manner	 in	 which	 those	 inherited	 and	 assimilated	 elements	 are
combined	is	unique.

This	 uniqueness,	 however,	 may	 not	 be	 absolute.	 It	 may	 be	 relative	 to	 a
certain	 fortuitous	 grouping	 of	 entities,	 or	 to	 the	 possession	 of	 characteristics
fortuitously	singled	out.	For	instance,	if	in	the	midst	of	a	group	of	fish	going	in
one	direction	in	the	stream,	you	see	one	fish	swimming	in	the	opposite	direction,
this	fish	acts	as	an	individual.	His	behavior	has	a	characteristic	which	is	unique.
If	three	fishes	behave	in	one	way	and	thousands	of	fishes	behave	in	another,	the
three	 fishes	 still	 can	 be	 said	 to	 have	 relatively	 individual	 behavior.	 Yet

considered	as	entities	in	themselves,	they	are	probably	fish	just	in	the	same	way
as	the	other	fishes;	and	thus	cannot	be	said	to	be	“individuals.”

Then,	if	you	look	at	a	brick	wall,	you	may	say	that	all	the	bricks	are	alike.
Yet	you	may	say	that	they	hold	individual	places,	for	each	brick,	in	terms	of	the
fact	that	it	occupies	one	definite	place,	is	unique.	No	two	bricks	occupy	the	same
place.

On	the	other	hand,	the	word	“collective”	refers	to	aggregates	which,	at	least
relatively	speaking,	have	no	uniquely	defined	characteristics	or	basis	in	time	and
space;	 or	 to	 attributes	 which	 are	 found	 to	 be	 possessed	 in	 common	 by	 many
entities.	 Blue	 eyes	 are	 collective	 factors;	 but	 the	 eyes	 of	 my	 friend	 Mr.	 X.	 are
individual	 —for	 they	 are	 unique	 and	 one	 of	 the	 characteristics	 of	 the	 unique
constellation	 of	 human	 factors	 which	 is	 known	 as	 Mr.	 X.	 In	 other	 words,	 the
relation	 between	 individual	 and	 collective	 is	 somewhat	 analogous	 to	 that
between	 particular	 and	 universal;	 only	 the	 word	 “universal”	 has	 various
connotations	and	an	etymological	sense	which	are	beside	the	point	which	we	are
making	 now.	 It	 must	 be	 added	 also	 that	 the	 strict	 meaning	 of	 individual	 and
collective	varies	according	to	the	type	of	entities	to	which	they	are	applied.	The
general	meaning,	however,	remains	the	same.

Every	 living	 entity	 can	 be	 said	 to	 possess	 both	 individual	 and	 collective
elements.	As	with	any	basic	dualism	of	principles,	the	two	are	never	separated.
What	 counts	 and	 what	 can	 be	 measured	 is	 the	 relative	 proportion	 in	 which	 the
two	coexist.	In	the	Chinese	yearly	cycle	of	transformation	no	day	was	found	in
which	either	Yang	 or	Yin	 was	 not	 operating.	 But	 as	 Yang	increased	 in	 potency,
Yin	decreased;	and	vice	versa.	 Likewise	from	the	standpoint	of	 Holism	there	is
no	 whole	 that	 cannot	 be	 considered	 as	 part	 of	 a	 greater	 whole	 (at	 least
potentially),	and	no	part	which	is	not	the	whole	for	lesser	parts	of	which	it	is	the
sum	total	and	synthesis.

As	 we	 deal	 with	 complex	 beings,	 with	 organisms	 which	 hold	 together
myriads	 of	 cells	 and	 lives	 by	 means	 of	 a	 more	 or	 less	 well-defined	 structural
arrangement,	we	find	ourselves	confronted	with	the	necessity	of	using	the	terms
individual	 and	 collective	 as	 adjectives	 qualifying	 the	 constituent	 elements	 of
these	 complex	 wholes.	 Individual	 and	 collective	 are	 forever	 qualifying
everything	 that	 is.	 Everything	 that	 is	 forever	 pulled	 by	 the	 two	 mighty	 powers
toward	the	individual	qualification	or	toward	the	collective	qualification.	This	is
the	great	universal	drama	of	being.

It	 is	 naturally	 in	 man	 that	 the	 drama	 is	 the	 most	 significant	 and	 the	 most

complete—to	men	at	least!	Thus,	by	watching	it	operate	within	our	total	being,
we	shall	be	better	able	to	see	it	operate	in	simpler	or	in	more	grandiose	ways,	in
atoms	or	galaxies.

### The	Formula	of	Cyclic	Transformation

The	 following	 cyclic	 formula	 is	 evidently	 but	 the	 simplest	 kind	 of
framework,	which	has	to	be	supplemented	in	every	particular	case	by	a	much
more	 complete	 one;	 but	 it	 parallels	 the	 equally	 simple	 Yang-Yin	formula	 of
China,	and	we	claim	that	it	has	the	same	universal	validity.	Its	value	lies	in
that	 it	 gives	 us	 a	 new	 perspective	 on	 psychological	 factors	 (conscious	 and
unconscious)	 and	 enables	 us	 to	 interpret	 all	 life-processes	 at	 the	 psy-
chomental	level.

We	begin	the	cycle	with	the	individual,	that	is,	with	a	unique	entity	wherein
are	 integrated	 a	 number	 of	 collective	 elements.	 From	 this	 individual	 emanate,
through	an	operation	which	we	shall	study	presently,	new	elements	which	are	the
exteriorization	of	his	individual	selfhood.

These	elements,	once	released	by	the	individual,	become	collective	elements.
They	 register	 upon	 the	 minds	 of	 other	 individuals	 who	 may	 or	 may	 not
assimilate	them;	they	become	the	common	property	of	all	men.	Such	collective
elements,	 emanated	 by	 individuals,	 are	 all	 added	 to	 the	 store	 of	 collective
experience	and	collective	knowledge.	They	accumulate	and	constitute	the	racial-
memory,	out	of	which	emerges	a	culture,	or	in	general,	civilization.

Civilization,	in	its	highest	sense	(and	not	 as	pictured	by	Spengler	who	sees
only	its	shadow),	is	really	a	process.	It	is	the	process	of	integration	of	collective
elements.	 Each	 generation	 of	 men	 pushes	 the	 process	 a	 step	 further,	 insofar	 as
individuals	within	this	generation	emanate	out	of	their	own	individual	selfhood
new	 elements.	 Civilization,	 as	 a	 process,	 culminates	 in	 the	 formation	 of	 what
mystics	have	called	the	“Holy	City,”	the	“New	Jerusalem”—and	in	one	sense,	at
least,	the	“White	Lodge.”	That	is	to	say,	it	ends	in	the	building	of	an	individual
formation	or	entity—at	the	psycho-mental	level—which	we	can	call,	with	H.	P.
Blavatsky,	 the	 “Seed-Manu.”	 It	 is	 the	 seed	 of	 the	 psycho-mental	 plant	 of
civilization.

This	seed,	as	a	psycho-mental	and,	in	a	sense,	cosmic	Individual,	emanates	at
the	 beginning	 of	 a	 new	 cycle	 collective	 elements.	 These	 collective	 elements
constitute	 the	 “primordial	 images	 of	 the	 unconscious”	 of	 which	 Jung	 speaks.

Also	 they	 are	 the	 “primeval	 revelation”	 of	 theosophy,	 the	 “sum	 total	 of	 innate
ideas”	 of	 other	 philosophical	 systems.	 These,	 combining	 with	 a	 new	 earth,	 or
generally	 speaking	 new	 substantial	 materials,	 constitute	 in	 turn	 the	 archetypal
structures	(“the	astral	selves”)	of	a	new	race-type.	Out	of	the	matrix,	which	this
new	 race-type	 constitutes,	 will	 emerge,	 by	 the	 process	 of	 evolution	 or
individuation,	individuals.	And	the	cycle	begins	again.

The	 phase	 of	 the	 cyclic	 process	 during	 which	 the	 individual	 emanates
elements	 which	 become	 the	 collective	 psycho-mental	 “stuff”	 of	 civilization	 is
the	 phase	 of	 collectivation.	 The	 phase	 during	 which	 this	 “stuff”	 becomes
integrated	into	the	“Seed-Manu”	or	“Holy	City”	is	the	phase	of	individuation.	It
reproduces	 on	 a	 larger	 scale	 the	 process	 following	 which	 a	 particular	 man
the	 psycho-mental	 energies	 of	 his	 being	 and	 becomes
integrates	 all
“individuated,”	 in	 Jung’s	 sense	 of	 the	 term.	 A	 similar	 process	 is	 that	 which
modern	science	calls	“evolution”—from	the	amoeba	to	man;	but	instead	of	this
process	being	a	straight	progressing	line,	it	is	cyclic.

What	is	liable	to	confuse	the	reader	is	the	simultaneous	development	of	man
as	 a	 species	 and	 of	 a	 multitude	 of	 men	 as	 relatively	 individuated	 personalities.
We	must	therefore	distinguish	between	generic	man	and	personal	man,	between
the	 “lesser	 individual”	 and	 the	 “Greater	 Individual.”	 Generic	 man	 is	 the
emanated	 image	 (or	 “shadow”)	 of	 the	 “Seed-Manu”	 of	 the	 preceding	 cosmic
cycle;	 and	 this	 Seed-Manu	 represents	 the	 “Greater	 Individual”	 who	 is	 an
“emergent	 Whole”	 made	 up	 of	 the	 quintessence	 of	 “lesser	 individuals”—viz.,
human	personalities.	This	“Greater	Individual”	of	the	end	of	the	cycle	manifests
as	the	“Creator”	of	the	beginning	of	the	cycle.	He	“creates”	a	new	species:	his
own	 image.	 Thus	 “God”	 created	 man	 in	 his	 own	 image;	 but	 “God”	 is	 the
individuated	sum	total	of	all	collective	psycho-mental	elements	emanated	by	the
individuals	of	the	preceding	cycle.	Individuals	among	men	today	are	emanating
“ideas”	 and	 “energies”	 which,	 once	 individuated	 at	 some	 distant	 time	 into	 the
end-synthesis	 of	 all	 human	 civilizations,	 will	 be	 the	 “God”	 that	 will	 “create”
some	new	species	of	“men”	at	the	beginning	of	the	future	cosmic	cycle	on	Earth
(or	perhaps	elsewhere).

We	 must	 not	 forget,	 however,	 that	 generic	 man,	 being	 thus	 the	 creation	 or
emanation	 of	 the	 “Greater	 Individual,”	 is	 originally	 a	 mass	 of	 collective
elements.	 Generic	 man	 is	 not	 an	 individual,	 but	 the	 matrix	 out	 of	 which	 the
individual	 will	 arise	 after	 a	 long	 process	 of	 individuation.	 Still	 more	 important
perhaps,	we	must	realize	that	this	process	takes	place,	first	at	the	physiological,

and	then	at	the	psycho-mental	level.	Thus	ancient	mythologies	speak	of	several
“Creations”;	thus	The	Secret	Doctrine	mentions	first	the	projection	of	the	“astral
shadows”	 (i.e.,	 the	 archetypal	 forms)	 of	 men,	 then	 that	 of	 the	 “sparks	 of
Mind”—the	nuclei	whence	germinates	and	develops	man’s	psycho-mental	being.
The	two	are	one,	in	a	sense,	but	they	operate	at	different	levels	of	being	and	by
organizing	a	different	kind	of	“substance.”

Without	 entering	 into	 the	 discussion	 of	 difficult	 points	 of	 “occult”
cosmogony,	we	can	say,	however,	that	no	creation	is	born	out	of,	or	emanated	by,
its	 creator,	 as	 an	 individual—it	 is	 born	 only	 with	 a	 potentiality	 (more	 or	 less
compelling)	of	individual	selfhood.	Thus	we	have	to	differentiate	in	every	man
between	 race-self	 and	 (potential	 or	 fulfilled)	 individual-self.	 The	 former	 is
collective	in	nature;	the	latter,	individual.	In	other	words	the	generic	type	of	man
(homo	sapiens)	reaches	 first	 a	 certain	 point	 of	 crystallization,	 which	 is	 generic
individuation;	 then	 the	 process	 of	 personal	 integration	 begins	 from	 such	 a
generic	foundation.

Generic	 individuation	 is	 a	 process	 affecting	 the	 sum	 total	 of	 human	 beings
which	 belong	 to	 a	 more	 or	 less	 clearly	 determined	 group.	 It	 operates	 by
gathering	together	in	a	definite	geographical	environment	human	 beings	which
have	 been	 projected	 (as	 “emigrants”)	 out	 of	 several	 relatively	 individuated
groups	and	thus	have	become,	from	the	race’s	standpoint,	“collective	elements.”
These	collective	elements	of	various	descriptions	become	slowly	homogenized.
That	which	homogenizes	them	into	a	generic	type	(or	later	“culture”)	is	a	series
of	 common	 experiences	 and	 the	 common	 assimilation	 of	 certain	 ideas	 and
“creations”	emanated	by	the	creative	individuals	of	the	group.	And	by	the	terms
“creative	individuals”	we	do	not	mean	only	“creative	artists.”	Any	one	who	has	a
new	idea	and	discovers	a	new	significance	in	any	experience,	or	relates	together
certain	 facts	 of	 experience	 in	 a	 new,	 and	 especially	 in	 a	 symbolic	 way—is	 a
creator.	As	what	he	has	thus	created	is	assimilated	by	several	men	of	his	group,	a
new	step	is	taken	toward	group-integration	or	generic	individuation.

Our	bodies	have	been	built,	and	their	type	and	functions	set,	just	in	this	way
—but	 through	 millions	 of	 years	 of	 generic	 individuation.	 The	 common
inheritance	 of	 mankind	 has	 accumulated	 for	 thousands	 of	 millennia.	 This
common	inheritance	is	the	“collective	unconscious”	formulated	by	Jung.	It	has
tremendous	 formative	 power.	 And	 its	 formations	 set	 the	 generic	 type—both	 of
our	bodies	and	our	psyches.	But,	let	us	not	forget,	these	energies-formations	of
the	 collective	 unconscious	 are	 not	 only	 the	 result	 of	 the	 assimilation	 of	 the
“lesser	 individuals’“	 creations	 (as	 above	 defined);	 they	 are	 also	 connected

causally	with	those	“primordial	images”	or	“innate	ideas”	which	emanated	at	the
beginning	 of	 the	 cycle	 of	 our	 present	 humanity	 from	 the	 “Greater	 Individual,”
the	“Seed-Manu”	of	the	preceding	cycle.

Again,	 what	 makes	 matters	 rather	 complex	 is	 that	 individuation	 and
collectivation	 operate	 at	 various	 levels	 and	 dovetail	 into	 each	 other.	 But	 if	 we
grasp	the	following	formula,	an	Ariadne	thread	may	lead	us	safely	through	the
labyrinth	 of	 the	 cyclic	 life-process:	 this	 life	 process	 is	 from	 collective	 to
collective	 through	 the	 individual.	 But	 we	 might	 also	 say:	 from	 any	 level	 of
individuation	to	the	next	higher	level	through	the	creative.	The	first	formulation
is	from	the	standpoint	of	substance;	the	second,	from	that	of	spirit,	or	unity.

If	 we	 take	 the	 formulation	 according	 to	 spirit,	 we	 have	 the	 cyclic	 formula
mentioned	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 this	 chapter;	 beginning-middle-end;	 or	 God-of-
the-beginning—the	dualistic	life-process—	God-of-the-end;	or	Seed-plant-seed;
or	 monad-personality-Self,	 psychologically	 speaking.	 Using	 the	 alpha	 and
omega	 symbolism,	 we	 could	 symbolize	 the	 formula	 by	 the	 word	 amo,	 which
means	in	Latin	“I	love.”	Comparing	it	to	the	Latin	Amen,	the	Sanskrit	Aum	and
the	Chinese	Omi,	may	prove	interesting	to	the	student	of	symbolism.	According
to	our	present	alphabet,	the	symbolic	formation	ought	to	be	Amz;	M	stands	for
the	collective—which	is	of	course	analogical	to	the	mother-element	ma,	and	the
sea	 (mar	 in	 Latin);	 A	 and	 Z	 represent	 the	 two	 stages	 of	 the	 Seed	 or	 the
Individual,	the	initial	and	the	culminal	or	synthetic.	A	stands	psychologically	for
the	monad;	M	for	the	personality	(in	our	sense	of	the	term,	the	equivalent	of	the
Sanskrit	manas);	Z	for	what	we	call,	with	Jung,	the	Self	(in	Sanskrit	Sva;	S	being
the	Sanskrit	equivalent	for	Z;	a	root	found	with	slight	difference	in	practically	all
Indo-European	languages).

If	we	accept,	however,	the	formula:	from	collective	to	collective	through	the
individual,	 we	 posit	 as	 primordial	 the	 world-process	 of	 change,	 the	 vast	 sea	 of
cosmic	elements,	forming	into	more	or	less	individual	wholes	which	break	again
into	parts.	The	individual	is	then	merely	the	momentary	flowering	of	a	process,
the	crest	of	the	waves	of	an	ever	restless	ocean.

### Quality,	Structure	and	Substance

Collective	elements	(whether	cosmic	or	human)	represent	always	the	pole	of
substance,	 as	 opposed	 to	 the	 individual	 which	 stands	 for	 spirit.	 As	 there	 are
elements	of	all	kinds	and	at	all	levels	of	being,	substance	may	be	of	many	types.
Thus	 we	 speak	 of	 physical	 and	 of	 psycho-mental	 substance.	 Substance	 is	 the
result	of	the	process	of	collectivation	(whether	as	disintegration	or	as	creation).

The	substance	which	results	from	disintegration	is	the	humus	made	of	decaying
leaves	 which	 will	 provide	 the	 new	 Spring	 vegetation	 with	 chemicals.	 The
substance	which	results	from	creation	is	symbolically	of	the	nature	of	the	seed-
substance.

In	 her	 exceedingly	 valuable	 book,	 attempting	 to	 effect	 a	 reconciliation
between	 Oriental	 and	 Occidental	 psychologies,	 Alice	 Bailey	 writes:	 “The	 key-
word	‘substance’	with	its	suggestion	of	materiality	is	a	misnomer.	It	is	helpful,
however,	to	reduce	this	word	to	its	Latin	roots:	‘sub’	under,	and	‘stare’	to	stand.
So	 substance	 is	 that	 which	 stands	 underneath,	 or	 underlies.”	 Substance,	 in	 its
philosophical	sense,	means	 substratum.	It	 is	 defined	 in	 Webster’s	 dictionary	 as
“That	 which	 underlies	 all	 outward	 manifestations;	 that	 in	 which	 properties
inhere.”	On	philosophical	grounds	of	logical	consistency	we	have	to	postulate	a
“psycho-mental	 substance”	 as	 a	 substratum	 to	 the	 psycho-mental	 activities	 of
spirit	 (or	 in	 man,	 the	 individual	 “quality”	 which	 is	 his	 spiritual	 reality).	 Every
realm	 of	 manifestation	 of	 spirit	 must	 have	 a	 corresponding	 type	 of	 substance,
spirit	 and	 matter	 being	 absolutely	 correlated.	 Psycho-mental	 substance	 may	 be
considered	an	emanation,	and	a	refined	product	of	physical	substance.	Or	it	may
be	that	physical	substance	is	the	condensation	of	a	universal	“mind-stuff.”

If	such	an	argument	is	to	be	dismissed	because	of	its	being	“metaphysical”
and	not	based	on	experience,	then	let	us	dismiss	all	the	new	atomic	physics.	The
ether,	 or	 the	 curvature	 of	 space,	 or	 electrons	 and	 photons,	 are	 all	 postulated	 as
the	substrata	of	recorded	activities.	The	activities	are	recorded,	but	no	eye	may
ever	see	the	ether,	or	the	electron,	and	still	less	“curved	space.”	There	is	as	much
evidence,	in	fact	much	more,	for	the	existence	of	a	“psycho-mental”	substance	as
there	 is	 for	 the	 existence	 of	 electrons,	 which	 are	 only	 logical	 necessities.
Besides,	 any	 concept	 of	 survival	 of	 consciousness,	 or	 immortality—a	 concept
which	 Jung	 considers	 a	 normal	 requirement	 for	 psychological	 health—requires
of	course	a	psycho-mental	substance.	For	once	physical	substance	is	gone,	there
must	 obviously	 be	 some	 other	 kind	 to	 serve	 as	 a	 substratum	 for	 the
consciousness.	If	this	is	denied,	then	the	denial	is	merely	a	quibbling	over	words,
and	 an	 archaic	 attachment	 of	 the	 consciousness	 to	 the	 “primordial	 image”	 of	 a
tangible	substance.

It	must	be	added,	however,	that	the	question	whether	or	not	such	a	postulated
psycho-mental	 substance	 can	 be	 actually	 experienced	 by	 man	 depends	 on
whether	or	not	man	is	susceptible	of	developing	superphysical	senses,	or	organs
of	 direct	 perception.	 Even	 if	 he	 cannot,	 there	 is	 such	 a	 thing	 as	 “inferential
evidence.”

In	 opposition	 to	 substance,	 what	 we	 call	 “quality”	 represents	 the	 spiritual
identity	 of	 the	 living	 whole.	 In	 our	 discussion	 of	 the	 philosophy	 of	 time	 in
Chapter	2	and	at	the	beginning	of	Chapter	3	we	saw	that	every	moment	of	time
is	creative	of	a	particular	quality	which	is,	figuratively,	stamped	upon	any	whole
reaching	the	condition	of	independent	existence	at	that	moment.	The	quality	of
the	 moment	 and	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 wholeness	 of	 the	 whole	 are	 identical.	 This
quality	as	it	is	projected	out	of	time,	so	to	speak,	is	the	monad	of	the	particular
whole	 considered.	 It	 is	 the	 One-in-the-beginning.	 It	 represents	 the	 individual
pole.

Quality,	 or	 monad,	 may	 refer	 to	 a	 species,	 or	 to	 a	 single	 human	 person.	 It
should	be	evident	from	what	was	said	previously	that	at	the	physiological	level
quality	is	generic,	not	personal.	In	other	words,	physiologically	speaking,	there
is	but	one	monad	for	the	whole	of	mankind,	just	as	there	is	only	one	monad	for
the	cat	or	the	dog	species	or	genus.	Individualhood	resides	in	the	species	or	sub-
species,	 not	 in	 the	 particular	 specimen	 thereof,	 a	 particular	 cat	 or	 a	 particular
dog.	There	are,	however,	an	infinite	number	of	gradations.	Individualization,	the
becoming	 different	 from	 the	 norm,	 has	 some	 place	 at	 the	 physiological	 level.
But,	 and	 this	 is	 the	 important	 point,	 only	 insofar	 as	 it	 provides	 a	 basis	 for
(substantial	 viewpoint),	 or	 is	 the	 expression	 of	 (spiritual	 viewpoint),	 psycho-
mental	factors.

What	might	be	better	to	say	is	that	physiological	individuation	is	of	a	lower
order	than	psycho-mental	individuation.	The	former	represents	a	collective,	the
latter,	 an	 individual	 emphasis.	 This	 will	 be	 clear	 if	 we	 remember	 that	 the
beginning	 of	 the	 cycle	 of	 humanity	 (of	 any	 cycle,	 in	 fact)	 is	 a	 creative	 act
releasing	 collective	 elements,	 which	 have	 only	 the	 potentiality	 of	 individual
selfhood.	 To	 repeat	 ourself:	 The	 Seed-being	 of	 the	 end	 of	 the	 preceding	 cycle
emanates	 creatively	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 human	 cycle	 a	 prototypal	 form	 (or
structure).	 This	 form,	 plus	 the	 energy	 with	 which	 it	 is	 endowed,	 is	 the
exteriorization	of	the	quality	01	Idea	which,	within	the	Seed-being,	conditioned
the	 creative	 act.	 This	 quality	 is	 the	 monad	 of	 the	 genus	homo:	the	 noumenon-
archetype	 thereof.	 It	 is	 exteriorized	 in	 the	 creative	 act	 as	 both	 energy	 and
structure.	 The	 structure	 remains	 unchanging,	 as	 the	 blue-print	 does	 during	 a
building	 operation.	 But	 the	 energy	 undergoes	 a	 process	 of	 differentiation	 and
transformation;	 that	 is	 to	 say,	 the	 money	 (social	 energy)	 put	 aside	 for	 the
building	at	the	beginning	of	the	operations	becomes	wood,	brick,	plumbing	and
the	salary	of	the	builders.

In	 other	 words,	 the	 idea	 of	 the	 building	 is	 the	 archetype.	 It	 conditions	 the
building-operations—the	 creative	 act.	 The	 latter	 involves	 the	 exteriorization	 of
the	“idea	of	the	building”	as	a	blueprint;	and	also	the	release	of	a	sum	of	money
—energy—to	 pay	 for	 the	 construction.	 When	 the	 building-operations	 are
completed,	the	blue-print	has	become	substantialized	into	a	concrete	body.	The
energy	has	become	transformed	into	work	and	the	gathering	of	materials;	but	as
the	 building	 (let	 us	 Say	 an	 apartment-house)	 is	 rented,	 the	 money	 expended	 in
building	 it	 will,	 at	 the	end	of	 the	cycle	 of	 business,	return	 to	its	 source,	with	 a
profit	(if	everything	goes	well!).

This	 illustration	 shows	 that	 the	 “creative	 act”	 releases	 collective	 elements
(that	 is,	 money—a	 strictly	 collective	 value),	 but	 with	 the	 potentiality	 of
individuality	 (the	 blue-print,	 as	 an	 exteriorization	 of	 the	 “idea”).	 The	 finished
apartment-house	 will	 have	 a	 certain	 amount	 of	 generic	 selfhood.	 It	 will	 have	 a
certain	quality,	in	terms	of	the	amount	of	money	(energy)	expended	as	well	as	of
its	structure.	It	will	thus	call	to	itself	a	certain	class	of	people	as	tenants.	These
tenants,	 by	 living	 together	 and	 interacting,	 will	 (if	 we	 are	 allowed	 to	 force	 a
point)	 build	 up	 a	 community	 of	 interests,	 of	 thoughts	 and	 behavior—which
might	be	described	as	the	psycho-mental	entity	of	the	apartment-house.	Within
the	 generic	 structure	 of	 the	 house	 will	 develop	 a	 psycho-mental	 individual
structure.	The	latter	will	of	course	be	moulded	somewhat	by	the	former.	Yet	this
house-structure	 will	 have	 been	 “created”	 by	 the	 owner-architect	 with	 a	 view	 to
attracting	by	special	features	a	certain	class	of	people.

If	 you	 would	 add	 that	 the	 owner-architect	 may	 be	 a	 co-operative	 group	 of
persons	building	the	house	in	order	to	live	in	it,	you	might	have	a	more	complete
picture,	from	the	spiritual	point	of	view.	That	co-operative	group	represents	now
the	Seed-being	of	the	preceding	cycle.	It	is	its	own	energy-money	which	is	being
spent	for	the	house	in	which,	as	a	group,	it	will	live,	and	from	which	it	will	draw
new	benefits	and	a	further	sense	of	integration.	The	house	can	be	said	to	be	built
during	the	summer	time,	when	the	co-operative	group	is	having	a	vacation	from
the	city;	or	perhaps	the	whole	group	is	living	still	in	another	city,	while	the	house
in	 the	 new	 city	 is	 being	 built.	 The	 fact	 is,	 at	 any	 rate,	 that	 the	 group	 does	 not
move	 into	 the	 house,	 as	 tenants,	 until	 it	 is	 completed—even	 though	 minor
alterations	 and	 the	 interior	 furnishing	 of	 the	 several	 apartments	 follow	 their
taking	possession	of	the	apartments.

The	illustration	is	obviously	only	an	illustration,	not	to	be	taken	too	literally;
but	it	may	help	to	focalize	(we	hope	not	crystallize)	some	of	the	abstract	ideas
previously	 stated.	 We	 may	 pursue	 it	 further	 by	 considering	 the	 behavior	 of	 the

co-operative	 group	 as	 tenants.	 The	 structure	 of	 the	 house,	 i.e.,	 the	 way
apartments	are	laid	out,	determines	a	great	many	of	their	daily	activities,	such	as
going	from	bed	to	bath,	and	from	bath	to	breakfast	room,	etc.	These	activities	are
unconscious:	 they	 depend	 on	 the	 generic	 structure	 of	 the	 house.	 They	 are
powerful	 and	 set,	 determined	 by	 unchangeable	 structure,	 by	 “primordial
images,”	 that	 is,	 by	 the	 original	 blue-print	 of	 the	 house	 (prototype	 of	 genus
homo)	which	in	turn	was	the	exteriorization	of	the	“idea”	of	the	building,	which
again	was	conditioned	by	the	former	habits,	consciousness	and	wealth	of	the	co-
operative	group	projecting	this	“idea.”	In	other	words,	they	are	the	end-results	of
a	very,	very	long	past.

On	the	other	 hand,	the	 type	 of	thinking	which	the	men	do	 at	 desks	 in	their
studies	 and	 all	 the	 emotional	 activities	 that	 go	 on	 between	 the	 tenants	 in	 their
respective	apartments,	or	as	they	visit	one	another,	are	not	very	much	bound	or
conditioned	by	the	plan	of	the	house.	Many	different	things	can	be	done	in	the
living	 room	 or	 in	 the	 studio—from	 making	 love	 to	 serving	 tea	 and	 playing
bridge,	 or	 having	 a	 recital.	 The	 more	 psychological	 and	 conscious	 activities	 of
the	 tenants	 are	 relatively	 free	 from	 the	 house-structure;	 whereas	 their
physiological	and	quasi-unconscious	movements	are	more	regulated	thereby.

The	 illustration	 becomes	 quite	 awkward	 at	 this	 point;	 but	 it	 may	 still	 serve
some	purpose.	What	it	attempts	to	convey	is	the	difference	between	permanent
structures	 which	 are	 generic,	 in	 man,	 and	 impermanent	 structures	 which	 are
more	personal.	The	former	refer	to	the	unconscious;	the	latter	to	the	conscious.
The	 generic	 is	 the	 collective	 inasmuch	 as	 it	 represents	 features	 and	 attributes
which	are	the	common	properties	of	the	many.	On	the	other	hand,	these	generic
features	can	be	traced,	not	only	to	common	experiences	and	reactions	under	the
same	 prolonged	 geographical	 and	 environmental	 conditions	 (as	 Jung	 claims,
being	a	modern	scientist);	but	must	be	said,	from	the	spiritual	viewpoint,	to	have
their	origin	in	the	creative	act	of	a	“Greater	Individual,”	the	“God-of-the-end”	of
the	preceding	cycle.

Thus	 “generic	 unconscious”	 would	 be	 a	 better	 term	 insofar	 as	 elements
involving	basic	common	structures	are	concerned,	such	as	“primordial	images.”
On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 term	 “collective	 unconscious”	 would	 mean	 more
specifically	the	results	of	the	process	of	civilization,	on	the	psycho-mental	plane
—the	slow-forming	ideals	of	mankind	which,	step	by	step,	integrate	the	souls	or
minds	 of	 all	 men	 into	 the	 Seed-being	 of	 the	 end	 of	 the	 cycle—at	 the	 psycho-
mental	 level.	 “Generic”	 refers	 more	 to	 that	 which	 results	 from	 physiological
structures	 common	 to	 all	 men;	 whereas	 “collective”	 applies	 more	 strictly	 to

those	psycho-mental	elements	which	in	the	course	of	human	evolution	are	being
released	 by	 creative	 individuals,	 and,	 after	 having	 been	 assimilated	 by	 many
generations,	become	the	common	inheritance	of	all	mankind.

### Generic	and	Individual	Structures	in	the	Body

Lest	 we	 be	 too	 severely	 accused	 of	 separating	 the	 physiological	 from	 the
psycho-mental,	the	body	from	the	psyche,	we	shall	differentiate	within	the	body
the	 individual	 and	 the	 generic	 structures,	 and	 briefly	 show	 their	 relationship,
which	parallels	at	the	physiological	level	the	psychological	relationship	between
conscious	and	unconscious	upon	which	Jung’s	psychological	method	is	founded.
Such	a	differentiation	is	of	course	relative,	not	absolute.	Any	part	of	the	body
can	present	features	which	are	characteristics	of	a	particular	individual	and	of	no
other.	All	physiological	functions	are	basically	generic,	yet	the	total	functioning
of	 every	 body	 could	 be	 described	 by	 a	 formula	 which	 would	 present	 a	 certain
character	 of	 uniqueness.	 Here	 we	 come	 again	 upon	 the	 fundamental	 idea	 that
elements	 are	 collective,	 but	 combining	 in	 complex	 ways	 each	 of	 which	 is	 to
some	 extent	 individual.	 In	 any	 such	 basic	 dualism—as	 Yang	and	 Yin,	 positive
and	 negative,	 individual	 and	 collective—we	 witness	 always	 a	 process	 of
combination	of	the	two	polarities.	This	process	may	mean	a	ruthless	conflict,	or
it	 may	 mean	 a	 harmonious	 adjustment	 based	 on	 the	 law	 of	 compensation	 and
cyclic	permutation.

Considering	the	dualism	of	collective	and	individual,	we	find	a	constant	shift
of	 emphasis	 between:	 1)	 faithfulness	 to	 the	 generic	 type;	 and	 2)	 stress	 upon
individual	 variations.	 Between	 these	 two	 attitudes	 the	 pendulum	 of	 life	 swings
constantly—as	 a	 study	 of	 past	 civilizations	 obviously	 shows.	 The	 swing
manifests	first	in	relation	to	the	physiological	nature	of	man.	As	this	body-nature
becomes	 relatively	 set,	 and	 a	 race-type	 is	 produced	 which	 exteriorizes	 in
physical	 bodies	 the	 “creative”	 archetypal	 “idea”	 to	 a	 degree	 of	 relative
perfection,	 the	 principle	 of	 individualization	 (i.e.,	 the	 stressing	 of	 individual
differences)	increases	in	power.	Then	it	is	as	if	“Life”	attempted	to	extract	from
the	 smallest	 individual	 variations	 in	 the	 generic	 physiological	 structure	 all	 the
possibilities	there	were	to	release	individuality	in	another	direction,	or	at	another
level.	 For	 instance,	 while	 the	 structure	 of	 the	 skull	 was	 relatively	 set,	 racially,
there	 came	 the	 possibility	 of	 developing	 brain-convolutions	 in	 depth,	 or
inwardly.	The	brain	grew	in	importance	within	the	relatively	set	bone-structure:
the	 brain,	 the	 medium	 through	 which	 individual	 differences	 could	 be	 stressed,
against	 the	 bone-structural	 conformity	 to	 the	 generic	 type.	 Thus	 the	 conscious

elements,	based	on	 the	 brain	 and	on	 the	cerebrospinal	 nervous	 system,	became
more	 and	 more	 emphasized;	 while	 the	 unconscious	 elements,	 based	 on	 the
ganglions	of	the	sympathetic	nervous	system	(the	solar	plexus,	principally)	and
the	cerebellum,	were	placed	somewhat	in	the	background.

The	Great	Sympathetic	system,	with	its	nerve-plexuses,	is	essentially	the	seat
of	generic	physiological	behavior	(instinct)	and	of	collective	unconscious	images
or	 impulses.	 It	 is	 the	 matrix	 from	 which	 or	 through	 which	 the	 “primordial
images”	 of	 the	 unconscious	 operate.	 This	 was	 stated,	 as	 early	 as	 1904	 (before
Jung’s	important	works),	by	Edward	Carpenter	in	his	book,	The	Art	of	Creation
(Ch.	 VI	 to	 XI).	 Carpenter,	 drawing	 his	 information	 partly	 at	 least	 from	 South-
Indian	 psychology,	 describes	 the	 progressive	 formation	 of	 race-images	 through
the	 experience	 of	 countless	 generations,	 and	 claims	 that	 these	 race-images
become	 associated	 with	 the	 nerve-plexus	 governing	 the	 related	 instinctual
activities	and	feelings	in	the	human	body.	He	considers	these	nerve-plexuses	as
the	 sources	 of	 great	 instinctual	 collective	 emotions.	 The	 Great	 Sympathetic
system	 is	 then	 viewed	 as	 “a	 kind	 of	 organ	 of	 the	 Emotions,	 in	 something	 the
same	way	as	the	Brain	is	regarded	as	the	organ	of	Thought.”	This	view	has	been
taken	 by	 many	 psychologists;	 however,	 we	 would	 use	 the	 term	 “feelings”	 here
rather	than	“emotions.”

As	 we	 saw	 already,	 feeling-judgments	 are	 like	 instincts,	 immediate
information	 as	 to	 the	 vital	 value	 of	 a	 situation	 or	 relationship.	 Feelings	 in	 the
more	 or	 less	 individualized	 man	 are	 strongly	 related	 to	 thoughts,	 but	 they	 are,
just	 the	 same,	 most	 obvious	 developments	 of	 the	 collective	 instincts.	 Feelings
may	 thus	 be	 called	 individualized	 instincts.	 They	 are	 individualized	 in
proportion	 as	 the	 cerebro-spinal	 system	 dominates	 the	 Great	 Sympathetic;
especially	 as	 the	 cerebrum	 dominates	 the	 solar	 plexus,	 which	 is	 the	 brain,	 or
center	of	the	Great	Sympathetic	system—and	is	thus	the	gate	for	the	“messages”
of	 the	 collective	 unconscious	 and	 its	 more	 or	 less	 individualized	 primordial
images.*

The	 cerebro-spinal	 system	 and	 the	 brain	 are	 the	 seats	 or	 organs	 of	 the
conscious	 ego—the	 individual	 factor	 per	 se	 in	 man.	 The	 ego	 is,	 according	 to
Jung,	“a	complex	of	representations	which	constitutes	the	centrum	of	my	field	of
consciousness	 and	 appears	 to	 possess	 a	 very	 high	 degree	 of	 continuity	 and
identity.	 Hence	 I	 also	 speak	 of	 an	 ego-complex”	 (Psychological	 Types).	 It	 is
defined	 by	 S.	 Radhakrishnan	 (quoted	 by	 Alice	 Bailey	 in	 The	 Soul	 and	 Its
Mechanism)	as	“the	psychological	unity	of	that	stream	of	conscious	experiencing

### which	constitutes	what	we	know	as	the	inner	life	of	an	empirical	self.”

The	 ego	 is	 the	 “principle	 of	 separateness,”	 symbolized	 in	 astrology	 by
Saturn.	It	is	that	which	says,	“I	am	this	particular	unique	entity	and	no	other.”	It
is	the	organ	of	variability	from	the	generic	type.	It	rules	over	the	first	phase	of
the	 process	 of	 individuation.	 Generally	 speaking	 we	 can	 divide	 the	 process	 of
individuation	 into	 two	 phases:	 The	 phase	 of	 differentiation	 during	 which	 the
potential	individual	emphasizes	his	own	differences	from	the	generic	norm,	and
the	phase	of	 assimilation	during	 which	 the	 differentiated	 individual	 assimilates
the	 contents	 of	 the	 collective	 unconscious,	 very	 much	 as	 the	 body	 grows	 by
assimilating	the	food-stuff	provided	by	the	“collective”	earth.

These	two	processes	operate	to	some	extent	synchronously,	but	the	emphasis
upon	the	one	or	the	other	characterizes	the	“age”	of	the	individual	selfhood.	The
stage	 of	 assimilation	 presupposes	 an	 advanced	 development	 of	 the	 psycho-
mental	 nature	of	 man	 —that	 is,	 in	fact,	 a	 vast	 collective	memory	 in	 the	 human
race,	 the	 inherited	 memory	 of	 all	 the	 achievements	 of	 many	 and	 varied
civilizations.

Here	again	we	find	a	reason	for	differentiating	between	the	generic	collective
factors	 and	 those	 psycho-mental	 attributes	 which	 are	 the	 accumulated	 products
of	civilization	after	civilization,	and	constitute	the	collective	inheritance	of	later
mankind.	 It	 may	 be	 said,	 in	 passing,	 that	 the	 nerve-plexuses	 of	 the	 Great
Sympathetic	system	(and	cerebellum)	are	the	gateways	or	agencies	for	the	influx
of	generic	energies	(instincts	 and	 the	most	 primordial	of	“primordial	images”);
whereas	 the	 brain’s	 lobes	 (which	 are	 the	 cotyledons	 of	 that	 human	 seed:	 the
head)	 are	 potential	 storehouses	 for	 the	 collective	 fruits	 of	 past	 civilizations.	 In
other	words,	what	is	called	in	its	totality	the	brain	has	to	be	subdivided	into	two
basic	sets	of	parts:	those	that	are	(figuratively	speaking)	store-houses	of	the	past,
and	 those	 that	 take	 out	 of	 these	 storehouses	 the	 collective	 elements,	 and	 re-
combine	 them	 into	 individual	 formations.	 A	 third	 set	 may	 even	 be	 mentioned
(according	to	Oriental	traditions),	which	refers	to	the	later	stage	of	individuation
and	 to	 the	 final	 integration	 of	 all	 life-factors.	 This	 was	 called	 in	 China	 “The
House	 of	 the	 Creative,”	 and	 seems	 to	 refer	 to	 such	 parts	 as	 the	 pituitary	 and
pineal	 glands	 and	 the	 Fourth	 Ventricle—and	 other	 “cavities.”	 The	 book,	 The
Secret	of	the	Golden	Flower,	deals	with	some	of	the	“occult”	processes	which	are
said	 to	 occur	 at	 the	 very	 center	 of	 the	 head	 and	 back	 of	 the	 root	 of	 the	 nose.
Likewise	books	on	the	Hindu	Kundalini	Yoga.

### Kundalini	Yoga	is	a	system	of	integration	of	collective	and	individual	at	the

physiological	level.	At	least	it	was	undoubtedly	so	in	archaic	times,	as	part	of	the
Tantrik	system,	 at	 the	 time	 when	 mankind	 was	 hardly	 functioning	 at	 all	 at	 the
psycho-mental	 level.	 Integration	 could	 therefore	 not	 be	 a	 really	 psychological,
and	still	less	a	mental	process.	Yet	it	was	a	reality	just	the	same.	The	energies	of
the	collective	(locked	in	the	chakras	or	centers	of	the	Great	Sympathetic	system)
were	 progressively	 assimilated,	 by	 means	 of	 special	 breathing	 exercises	 and
postures,	by	the	center	of	individual	will	in	man	(presumably	at	the	center	of	the
head,	or	“between	the	eyebrows”).	All	the	generic	energies	and	instincts	of	the
bodies	were	drawn	to	the	head	and	made	subject	to	the	individual	will	of	the	ego
(or	perhaps	even	more,	of	the	monad).	This	was	called	the	“turn-back	process”;
the	differentiated	monadic	energies	were,	as	it	were,	re-unified	by	an	act	of	will.
The	more	recent	type	of	Kundalini	Yoga,	since	600	 B.C	 or	later,	emphasizes
psychological	integration	of	collective	elements	by	the	individual	ego.	But	much
still	depends	upon	the	physiological	factors.	This	is,	however,	in	India,	pervaded
as	 yet	 by	 the	 devotional	 attitude	 which	 preserves,	 by	 spiritual	 will	 and
concentration	upon	absolute	unity,	the	living	memory-image	of	the	God-of-the-
beginning.	 But	 it	 seems	 that	 a	 new	 technique	 of	 integration	 is	 developing	 (or
about	to	develop	in	the	West	in	preparation	for	the	“new	era”)	which	will	throw
the	 almost	 complete	 emphasis	 of	 the	 process	 at	 the	 psycho-mental	 level.	 In	 a
series	of	lectures	given	in	student	classes	by	Jung	on	Kundalini	Yoga,	an	attempt
was	 apparently	 made	 to	 interpret	 the	 system	 strictly	 as	 a	 technique	 of
psychological	 individuation—or	 as	 a	 system	 of	 symbolism.	 In	 Blavatsky’s	 The
Secret	 Doctrine,	 and	 still	 more	 in	 Alice	 Bailey’s	 books	 on	 meditation	 and	 the
treatises	on	Cosmic	Fire	and	White	Magic,	much	invaluable	information	is	given
about	the	new	location	of	the	chakras	(now	connected	with	the	spine,	because	of
the	 new	 individual	 and	 psycho-mental	 emphasis);	 also	 about	 new	 methods	 of
development	in	what	might	be	called	“occult”	psychology.

Whether	we	speak	of	the	oldest	form	of	physiological	Tantrika,	of	the	more
psychological	type	of	Kundalini	Yoga,	of	the	process	of	individuation	in	Jung’s
psychology,	or	of	new	forms	of	meditation	used	in	various	“esoteric	schools”—
in	every	case	we	are	dealing	with	interpretations	and	techniques	of	integration,
which	 usually	 mean	 the	 same	 thing	 at	 different	 levels:	 the	 assimilation	 of
collective	elements	by	the	individual,	toward	the	building	of	the	perfect	Self,	or
Soul-body,	 the	 “Temple	 of	 Solomon,”	 or	 the	 “Christ-Body,”	 or	 the	 “Diamond-
Body.”	 Thus	 always	 the	 process	 of	 individuation,	 the	 working	 out	 of	 the
essential	relationship	between	individual	and	collective.

This	 process	 consists	 in	 a	 gradual	 shifting	 of	 the	 center	 of	 gravity	 of	 the
human	 “personality.”	 Kundalini	 is	 raised	 from	 the	 lowest	 sacral	 plexus
(Muladhara	chakra)	to	the	center	between	the	eyebrows	(Ajna	chakra):	the	seat
of	the	conscious	ego.	Each	chakra	represents	a	stage	of	the	process.	Through	the
intermediary	of	the	heart,	the	solar	plexus	(and	the	lower	plexuses	it	synthetizes)
and	 the	 conscious	 center	 in	 the	 head	 are	 integrated.	 This	 is	 the	 “mystical
marriage”;	not	so	much	of	the	“man”	and	“woman”	within	each	person—rather
of	 the	 “individual”	 (ego)	 and	 the	 “collective”	 (the	 generic	 self	 in	 the	 solar
plexus).

In	the	Chinese	Secret	of	the	Golden	Flower	the	union	is	between	“essence”
(individual)	 and	 “life”	 (collective).	 The	 essence	 without	 the	 life	 is	 pure
abstraction—the	 “I”	 devoid	 of	 qualities.	 The	 life	 without	 the	 essence	 is	 mere
instinct,	 or	 perfectly	 adequate	 generic	 behavior.	 The	 essence	 must	 therefore
assimilate	the	life.	The	Empty	must	be	filled	by	the	Waters	of	Life.	This	is	the
synthesis.	 The	 true	 individual	 does	 not	 stand	 against	 the	 collective,	 as	 a
conscious	ego	opposing	with	his	will	the	generic	energies.	The	true	individual	is
the	flowering	and	the	fruition	of	the	collective,	which	finds	itself	fulfilled	in	and
through	him.	He	is	the	collectivity	become	conscious	and	significant.	He	is	the
drop	who	has	assimilated	the	wholeness	of	the	ocean’s	characteristic	being,	and
thus	is	a	perfect	exemplar	of	“sea-water-hood.”

This	 is	 “operative	 wholeness”—wholeness	 operating	 as	 and	 through	 a
particular	 whole.	 An	 individual	 man	 acting	 as	 the	 agent	 of	 Man-the-whole—
acting,	 however,	 according	 to	 his	 own	 particular	 destiny	 as	 an	 individual.	 The
path	 of	 operative	 wholeness	 is	 Tao.	 It	 is	 the	 path	 of	 relationship;	 the	 “middle
path”	 integrating	 individual	 and	 collective,	 thinking	 and	 feeling,	 esthetics	 and
ethics.	It	is	the	path	of	Kundalini—which	is	“serpentine,”	because	cyclic.	It	is	the
Via	dolorosa	of	Christian	mysticism,	each	station	of	which	is	one	of	the	spinal
chakras,	 up	 to	 the	 “Mount	 of	 Skull”—	 Golgotha.	 In	 the	 lower	 chakras,	 the
collective	dominates	(as	in	sex);	in	the	higher,	the	individual,	until	the	Cross	is
reached,	 at	 the	 base	 of	 the	 cranium	 (where	 the	 nerves	 actually	 cross).	 Then
Iesous	is	crucified	 between	 the	two	thieves	 in	 the	center	 of	the	 head.	But	after
the	 Third	 Day	 (or	 ventricle)	 He	 rises	 and	 is	 seen	 in	 his	 “Risen	 Body”—in	 the
glory	 that	 is	 the	 Thousand-petalled	 Lotus,	 above	 the	 crown	 of	 the	 head,	 the
Sahasrara	chakra,	the	“Halo”	of	Western	Saints	as	well	as	of	Oriental	Buddhas;
the	radiance	of	operative	Wholeness.

### The	Nature	of	the	Personality

We	may	now	ask:	What	is	the	fundamental	difference	between	the	“occult”
approach	and	the	“psychological”	(in	Jung’s	sense)?	It	is	that	the	latter	occupies
itself	solely	with	the	“life-process,”	with	the	development	of	the	“personality”;
while	the	former	deals	with	this	“process”	mostly	in	terms	of	its	being	a	creative
(or	disintegrative)	interlude	between	the	“beginning”	and	the	“end”	of	the	cycle,
of	which	the	“process”	is	the	middle—as	we	saw	in	the	first	part	of	this	chapter.

We	 shall	 define	 the	 term	 “personality”	 as	 the	 exteriorization	 of	 the	 ever-
changing	 pattern	 produced	 by	 the	 interplay	 of	 collective	 and	 individual	 in	 the
whole	human	entity	(body	and	psyche).	It	represents	the	daily	“balance-sheet”	of
the	“process”	of	living—a	balance-sheet	which,	with	many	of	us,	remains	in	the
red	most	insistently!	The	personality	is	therefore	the	human	being	as	it	appears
from	day	to	day,	with	its	behavior,	thoughts	and	feelings.	It	is	the	“front”	which
the	total	man	presents	to	the	outer	world.	Back	of	it	are	the	numerous	currents
and	conflicts	of	unconscious	and	conscious,	the	bodily	as	well	as	psychological
tendencies;	 all	 of	 which	 are	 more	 or	 less	 amalgamated	 in	 that	 complex	 of
representations,	 the	 personality.	 Many	 cases	 are	 possible	 according	 as	 the
emphasis	is	laid	on	this	or	that	factor	in	the	life-process	of	the	total	being.	The
center	 or	 ruler	 of	 the	 personality	 may	 be	 the	 conscious	 ego,	 if	 and	 when
individual	values	dominate;	but	it	may	just	as	 well	 be	 a	 “primordial	image”	 of
the	 unconscious,	 or	 a	 powerful	 instinct.	 Fear	 or	 sex	 can	 and	 often	 do	 rule	 our
personality;	 or	 the	 yearning	 for	 utter	 surrender	 to	 a	 “primordial	 image,”	 or	 a
“god”—or	a	spook.

The	 personality,	 near	 the	 end	 of	 the	 true	 process	 of	 individuation,	 is	 fully
integrated	by	and	centered	around	the	Self.	At	the	very	dawn	of	the	process,	the
personality	 is	 normally	 divided	 into	 two	 parts:	 the	 physiological	 part	 ruled	 by
instincts	 and	 inherited	 impulses	 (or	 the	 power	 of	 the	 environment),	 and	 the
psycho-mental	 part,	 which	 is	 potential	 rather	 than	 actual,	 and	 one	 with	 the
monad	and	“primordial	images.”	This	stage	is	that	of	primordial	man,	a	bodily
animal	and	a	“spiritual”	psyche.	Thus	we	find	in	him	both	the	finest	devotional
aspirations	and	the	most	violent	instinctual	passions—natural,	not	individualized
or	neutralized	passions.	At	a	later	stage,	and	for	various	reasons,	the	personality
may	split	off	into	“partial	souls”:	we	have	cases	of	double	or	multiple	personality
operating	in	and	through	one	body.

The	process	of	development	of	the	personality	is	analogical	to	the	Kundalini
process,	insofar	as	we	deal	in	both	cases	with	the	progressive	shift	of	the	balance
of	 individual	 and	 collective	 forces,	 toward	 integration	 or	 disintegration.	 But
strictly	speaking,	the	“raising	of	Kundalini”	is	an	occult	process—in	a	sense,	a

forced	process;	hence,	the	great	danger	involved	in	it.	In	the	new	psychological
sense,	the	process	is	that	of	individuation	(in	Jung’s	sense);	and	it	presupposes	at
the	start	a	conscious	development	of	the	psyche,	a	relatively	strong	emphasis	on
the	 individual	 ego.	 For	 this	 ego	 is	 the	 focal	 point	 for	 the	 assimilation	 of	 the
collective	energies.	Without	such	a	focal	point,	and	a	strong	one,	the	inflow	of
collective	energies	would	overwhelm	the	consciousness,	and	the	splitting	off	of
the	 personality	 would	 undoubtedly	 occur.	 It	 would	 be	 a	 case	 of	 putting	 a
dynamite-like	gasoline	into	a	weakly	built	automobile	engine.	The	engine	would
explode.	It	is	therefore	necessary	to	build	first	a	strong	individual	engine,	steel-
like	 in	 its	 resistance	 and	 resilience,	 before	 pouring	 in	 it	 collective	 energies.	 In
other	words:	one	does	not	feed	meat	to	babes!

We	 shall	 interpret	 this	 astrologically	 when	 we	 study	 the	 effects	 of	 such
planets	 as	 Uranus,	 Neptune	 and	 Pluto,	 which	 symbolize	 collective	 or
unconscious	forces.	Unless	the	individual	ego	of	the	native	is	strong,	these	forces
are	bound	to	be	destructive	of	the	unity	of	the	personality.	Otherwise	they	act	as
high-powered	 gasoline	 in	 Rolls-Royce	 engines.	 The	 functioning	 is	 formidably
enhanced.	 We	 shall	 see	 also	 that	 the	 pattern	 constituted	 by	 all	 the	 planets
represents	 the	 personality—the	 balance-sheet	 of	 the	 collective-individual
relationship.	 This	 balance-sheet	 is	 not	 a	 static	 one:	 thus	 the	 idea	 of
“progressions”—in	 this	 case,	 secondary	 progressions.	 These	 measure	 the
movements	of	the	balance-sheet	throughout	the	life.	The	progression	of	the	axes
of	 the	 chart	 refers	 to	 the	 development	 of	 the	 individual	 factors;	 the	 planetary
“transits”	refer	to	the	strictly	collective	factors.	But	of	this,	more	later.

Complexes	 and	 in	 general	 what	 Jung	 calls	 “the	 personal	 unconscious”	 (the
Freudian	 “unconscious”	 also)	 are	 the	 manifestations	 of	 a	 balance	 at	 least
temporarily	 “in	 the	 red,”	 the	 results	 of	 the	 inability	 to	 relate	 integratively	 and
properly	 to	 adjust	 collective	 and	 individual.	 (Inherited	 tendencies	 toward	 such
maladjustments	 are	 shown	 in	 retrograde	planets.	 The	 relationship	 between	 the
planetary	 pattern—especially	 the	 Sun—and	 the	 two	 axes	 of	 the	 birth-chart
indicate	future	potentialities	of	successful	or	unsuccessful	adjustment.)

The	 adjustment	 of	 collective	 to	 individual,	 and	 vice	 versa,	 is	 the
psychological	“marriage.”	The	individual	per	se	is	solely	an	abstract	structure—
a	formula.	It	must	be	filled	with	life	and	light	—with	collective	elements.	In	the
first	stage	of	the	process	of	development	of	the	personality,	“life”	flows	in;	viz.,
the	generic	energies	of	the	physiological	nature.	As	psycho-mental	growth	really
begins	and	the	conscious	ego	asserts	itself,	it	is	“light”	that	should	flow	into	the
abstract	 structure	 of	 individual	 selfhood.	 By	 “light”	 is	 meant	 the	 essence	 of

civilization—in	 the	 spiritual	 sense	 of	 the	 term;	 the	 synthesis	 of	 the	 gift	 of	 all
truly	creative	individuals	to	mankind	as	a	whole.

Out	 of	 this	 “light”	 is	 built	 the	 permanent	 psycho-mental	 organism	 of	 the
individual	 human	 being:	 the	 synthesis	 and	 Seed	 of	 a	 whole	 cycle	 of	 life-
development—the	 “Diamond	 Body.”	 This	 strictly	 individual	 body	 (which	 is
presumably	 what	 theosophical	 teachings	 call	 the	 “Causal	 Body”)	 is	 what	 we
would	 call	 the	 “Soul.”	 The	 vast	 majority	 of	 men	 are	 only	 potential	Souls.	The
structure	or	form	is	there	inasmuch	and	insofar	as	they	function	as	“individuals”;
but	there	is	usually	very	little	in	this	structure;	and	so	we	would	say	that	the	Soul
is	only	potential.	It	does	not	function	as	an	“organism.”	There	is	no	real	actual
vitality	 in	 it.	 The	 Light	 does	 not	 shine,	 because	 the	 mystic	 “Circulation	 of	 the
Light”	(cf.	The	Secret	of	the	Golden	Flower)	does	not	yet	operate.

It	 is	 only	 when	 the	 monad	 (the	 God-in-beginning)—which	 had,	 in	 a	 sense,
become	 the	 life-process	 (or	 personality)—is	 reborn	 within	 the	 structure	 of	 the
individual	conscious	ego,	that	the	Soul	begins	to	function	as	an	actual	organism.
Before	 that,	 it	 was	 only	 the	 remembrance	 or	 reminiscence	 of	 the	 monad,—the
ancient	 and	 primordial	 Archetype,	 “watching,”	 as	 it	 were,	 from	 the	 deepest
within	or	the	highest	above—which	seemed	to	be	the	Soul.	But	it	is	only	as	the
Monad-of-the-beginning	is	reborn	within	the	ego	as	the	Self-of-the-end	that	the
Soul	 becomes	 an	 actual	 organism	 of	 psycho-mental	 substance,	 vibrating	 with
light—as	the	physiological	organism	pulsates	with	blood.

As	 this	 occurs	 the	 ego	 “loses	 itself”	 into	 the	 Self.	 But	 this	 is	 obviously	 no
loss.	The	ego	was	merely	the	center	of	the	phase	of	individual	differentiation—
somewhat	like	a	scaffolding.	As	the	Self	assimilates	fully	the	collective	energies
it	 becomes	 the	 whole	 of	 the	 psyche.	 The	 distinction	 between	 unconscious	 and
conscious	ceases	(at	least	as	far	as	this	cycle	is	concerned).	Man	becomes	totally
conscious:	 an	 Awakened	 One—a	 buddha	 (figuratively	 speaking).	 He	 need	 not
give	 himself	 up	 to	 the	 unconscious	 in	 sleep,	 or	 even	 in	 death.	 The	 body	 may
disintegrate;	but	as	the	individual	has	now	built	his	“body	of	immortality”	made
out	 of	 psycho-mental	 substance,	 he	 will	 not	 lose	 his	 individual	 selfhood—as
long	as	mankind	lives.	For,	remember,	this	psycho-mental	substance	is	made	up
of	 the	 essence	 of	 human	 civilization;	 it	 is	 made	 up	 of	 the	 “light	 of	 Man-the-
whole”	and	can	last	only	as	long	as	Man-the-whole	lasts.

Thus	the	merely-individual	ego	becomes	the	individual-plus-collective	Self,
a	 focalized	 expression	 and	 an	 agent	 of	 Man-the-whole.	 The	 light	 of	 Man-the-
whole	is	the	very	substance	of	his	being—and	it	may	even	radiate	as	a	particular

vibration	 down	 to	 and	 out	 of	 the	 physical	 body.	 But	 this	 light	 becomes
differentiated	 according
individual	 selfhood	 structurally
type	 of
conditioning	 and	 focalizing	 it—which,	in	turn,	depends	on	the	 original	monad.
Thus	the	occultist	speaks	of	“Seven	Rays”:	seven	large	groups	of	monads	in	the
beginning	 (and	 Souls	 or	 Selves	 after	 individuation)	 which	 are	 to	 the	 spiritual
reality	of	Man-the-whole	what	colors	are	to	the	white	light.

### the

### to

What	 must	 be	 stressed	 is,	 first,	 that	 the	 fundamental	 structure	 of	 the
individual	selfhood	is	not	changed	as	the	ego	becomes	the	Self	and	individuation
is	 reached.	 It	 becomes	 filled	 with	 light.	 Then,	 we	 must	 grasp	 the	 difference
between,	 on	 one	 hand,	 the	 personality	 who	 becomes	 ruled	 by	 an	 entitized
“primordial	image”	or	“god,”	and	acts	as	a	mere	medium;	and	on	the	other,	the
individuated	 being	 who	 becomes,	 as	 a	 Self,	 an	 individual	 focus	 (ox	 Man-the-
whole—an	operative	agent	with	a	work	 to	perform	in	 terms	 of	the	 activity	 and
the	 need	 of	 the	 whole.	 The	 wisdom	 of	 the	 former	 is	 always	 more	 or	 less
separative	 (even	 where	 it	 appears	 to	 unify);	 the	 wisdom	 of	 the	 latter	 is	 a
focalized	 expression	 of	 the	 wisdom	 and	 civilization	 of	 the	 whole	 of	 past	 and
present	 mankind,	 differentiated	 only	 for	 a	 particular	 and	 conscious	 use.	 The
realm	 of	 the	 conscious	 is	 that	 of	 opinions	 and	 of	 theories.	 The	 realm	 of	 the
unconscious	 is	 that	 of	 instincts,	 of	 the	 immediate	 and	 incontrovertible	 feeling-
apprehension	 of	 needs.	 The	 realm	 of	 Self	 is	 that	 of	 consciously	 self-evident
truths,	 perceived	 unanimously	 by	 all	 those	 who	 are	 fully	 one	 with	 the	 ultimate
Whole:—The	Seed-men	 (in	Sanskrit,	 Shistas)	who	constitute	in	 their	 sum	 total
the	 God-of-the-end;	 not	 a	 single	 entity,	 but	 a	 unanimous	 Host,	 to	 whom	 some
fifteen	years	ago	we	gave	the	name	of	Synanthropy.

### Summing-up

It	may	be	well	at	this	point	to	go	over	the	ground	which	we	have	covered	so
far;	after	which	it	will	be	easier	to	draw	this	chapter	to	a	close	with	a	very	brief
sketch	 of	 some	 of	 the	 possibilities	 of	 extension	 and	 application	 of	 our	 cyclic
Formula.

First	 of	 all,	 we	 inferred	 that,	 as	 the	 philosophy	 of	 Time,	 which	 is	 the
necessary	 background	 to	 a	 vital	 and	 holistic	 presentation	 of	 astrology,	 finds	 its
expression	 essentially	 in	 two	 factors:	 viz.,	 the	 Moment	 and	 the	 Cycle;	 and	 as,
moreover,	 we	 had	 already	 discussed	 in	 the	 two	 preceding	 chapters	 the	 creative
essence	 of	 the	 moment—therefore	 our	 task	 was	 to	 study	 the	 Cycle.	 We	 then
stated	 that,	 in	 past	 civilizations,	 formulas	 defining	 the	 essence	 and	 structure	 of
the	Cycle	had	been	produced;	and	that	such	formulas,	based	as	they	were	upon

the	 respective	 characteristic	 world-viewpoints	 of	 the	 civilizations	 considered,
served	 as	 quasi-algebraic	 means	 of	 integrating	 all	 the	 knowledge	 possessed	 by
such	civilizations.	We	analyzed	briefly	the	essence	of	the	Cycle,	and	isolated	the
three	terms	which	in	their	trinity	constitute	its	wholeness:	beginning,	middle,	end
—or	 the	 One-that-is-in-the-beginning,	 the	 process	 of	 becoming,	 the	 Seed-
Synthesis	of	the	End.	We	found	that	three	basic	types	of	world-viewpoints	could
be	 determined,	 each	 of	 which	 emphasizes	 one	 of	 the	 three	 components	 of	 the
Cycle,	 and	 we	 studied	 briefly	 the	 cyclic	 Formulas	 which	 expressed	 the	 typical
world-viewpoint	 of	 Hindu	 civilization,	 with	 its	 devotional	 emphasis	 on	 the
monad	or	original	One,	and	of	the	Chinese	civilization,	with	its	ethical	emphasis
on
the	 condition	 of
equilibratedness,	becomes	the	“conscious	Way”	that	is	Tao,	the	Way	that	leads	to
fulfillment	in	and	through	perfect	Harmony.

### the	 dualistic	 process	 of	 becoming	 which,	 under

We	 then	 defined	 the	 three	 terms	 of	 the	 new	 cyclic	 Formula:	 individual,
collective	 and	 creative;	 and	 their	 inter-relationship	 at	 the	 various	 stages	 of	 the
cycle.	 We	 emphasized	 especially	 the	 view	 which	 considers	 the	 Cycle	 as	 a
process	leading	from	the	“lesser	individual”	to	the	“Greater	Individual”	through
the	 operation	 of	 the	 creative,	 releasing	 collective	 elements	 which	 become
integrated	 into	 the	 larger	 synthesis	 which	 is	 the	 substantial	 foundation	 of	 the
“Greater	Individual”—who	in	turn	projects	creatively	the	monadic	structures	of
the	future	“lesser	individuals.”

Complexity	arises	because	the	creative	operates	in	several	ways	according	as
this	or	that	phase	of	the	total	Cycle	is	considered.	Thus	it	may	refer	to	various
subsequent	 factors,	 which	 may	 not	 appear	 at	 first	 to	 be	 analogical.	 In	 order	 to
bring	 the	 matter	 of	 the	 creative	 to	 a	 psychological	 focalization,	 we	 discussed
various	 types	 of	 “creative	 integration,”	 through	 which	 the	 conflict	 between
individual	and	collective	is	solved.	The	concept	of	“personality”	as	the	balance-
sheet	 of	 individual	 and	 collective	 tendencies,	 also	 as	 the	 creative	 whole	 of	 the
harmonized	human	being;	the	concept	of	Kundalini	as	the	physio-psychological
process	 through	 which	 the	 generic	 or	 collective	 centers	 of	 the	 body	 and	 the
individual	or	conscious	centers	of	the	cerebro-spinal	system	are	integrated;—the
concept	of	“individuation”	as	presented	by	Jung,	viz.,	as	a	series	of	assimilations
by	 the	 conscious	 ego	 of	 unconscious	 life-contents	 .	 .	 .	 these	 and	 many	 others
refer	to	the	basic	term:	the	creative.

Whereas	we	spoke	of	the	end	of	the	cycle	as	the	moment	of	summation	and
synthesis,	we	must	also	realize	that	it	is	the	phase	of	the	greatest	manifestation	of
the	creative.	In	another	sense	the	creative	is	that	factor	which	links	the	end	and

the	beginning	of	all	cycles.	And	as	cycles	are	within	cycles,	every	moment	 can
be	considered	as	that	creative	moment	when	the	end	of	a	cycle	gives	birth	to	the
beginning	 of	 a	 new	 cycle.	 This	 is	 the	 Creative	 Now—living	 in	 which,	 man
becomes	god-like,	an	agent	for	the	creativeness	of	the	“Greater	Individual”	who,
at	 the	 limit,	 is	 the	 universal	 God—	 the	 Supreme	 Wholeness	 of	 the	 absolute
Whole.

We	 may	 bring	 this	 chapter	 to	 a	 close	 by	 adding	 that	 the	 three	 terms	 of	 the
Cyclic	 Formula	 (individual,	 collective,	 creative)	 as	 well	 as	 the	 three	 phases	 of
the	Cycle	(beginning,	middle	and	end)	can	readily	be	correlated	with	three	basic
types	of	human	beings	—and	also	with	three	fundamental	types	of	attitude	to	the
universe	and	its	problems,	i.e.,	three	fundamental	types	of	knowledge.

The	 typical	 devotee	 looks	 back	 to	 the	 One-that-is-in-the-beginning.	 He
yearns	 for	 unity;	 but	 this	 yearning	 takes	 the	 form	 of	 a	 longing	 for	 the	 glorious
and	spiritual	past,	for	the	Golden	Age	which	is	the	first	period	of	the	cycle,	when
the	 “first-born”—the	 divine	 Ancestors—lived,	 still	 bathed	 in	 the	 glowing
remembrance	 of	 the	 One.	 By	 worship	 and	 concentration	 the	 devotee	 preserves
the	Image	of	this	One.	Thus	he	keeps	alive	not	only	the	memory	of	the	Original
Source,	but,	as	a	result,	also	the	fact	of	the	life-process	being	a	monistic,	because
rooted-in-a-One,	process.

The	 scientist	 and	 the	 psychologist	 (also	 the	 philosopher	 of	 the	 Bergsonian
type)	 study	 the	 process	 and	 attempt	 either	 to	 bring	 order	 into	 its	 apparent
confusion	 or	 to	 help	 men	 to	 go	 safely	 through	 it	 until	 the	 end	 is	 reached—the
nature	of	which	they	only	surmise	by	general	inference.	The	occultist,	if	he	be	a
true	one,	is	a	combination	of	devotee	and	scientist.	Because	he	knows	in	varying
degrees	the	reality	and	form	of	the	One-in-the-beginning	or	Monad,	he	can	also
know	 the	 result	 of	 the	 process	 which	 will	 have	 for	 its	 consummation	 the
integrated	 sum	 total	 uniting	 in	 an	 organic	 synthesis	 the	 successful	 fruits	 of	 the
entire	process.

The	 artist	and	the	 philosopher,	in	 different	 ways,	 are	 operating	 in	 terms	 of
this	 ideal	 of	 consummation;	 the	 former	 by	 producing	 works	 of	 art	 which	 are
prophetic	 symbols	 of	 the	 organic	 synthesis	 of	 the	 Last	 Day;	 the	 latter	 by
presenting	 to	 men	 pictures	 of	 the	 goal,	 purpose	 and	 significance	 of	 the	 whole
life-process.

The	devotee	merges	with	the	original	One—who	is	the	“Greater	Individual,”
his	 Creator,	 his	 Father-Mother;	 this	 merging,	 when	 not	 direct,	 is	 accomplished
through	 the	 intermediary	 of	 guru,	 spiritual	 teacher,	 priest	 or	 hierophant—who

are	supposed	to	have	accomplished	such	an	identification	with	the	original	One.
The	 scientist—in	 a	 positive,	 analytical	 way—and	 the	 ordinary	 toiler—	 in	 a
passive,	helpless	way—deal	with	the	process	of	becoming;	the	latter	being	truly
immerged	in	and	a	tool	of	it.	As	for	the	creative	personality—whether	creative	of
forms	or	creative	of	meanings—such	a	one	gathers	into	and	within	himself	the
needs	 and	 the	 yearnings	 of	 the	 collective	 and	 fulfills	 them	 creatively,	 uttering
prophetically	that	which	will	become	the	seed	and	archetype	of	the	next	phase	of
the	cycle—the	next	“Dispensation.”

### The	Three	Great	Approaches	to	Knowledge

A	 similar	 analysis	 can	 be	 made	 concerning	 the	 three	 basic	 approaches	 to
knowledge.	 Usually	 such	 approaches	 would	 probably	 be	 defined	 as	 religion,
science	 and	 philosophy.	 We	 believe,	 however,	 that	 in	 the	 future	 the	 new—and
undoubtedly	 to	 most	 people	 very	 puzzling—classification	 should	 be:	 the
astrological,	 the	 psychological	 and	 the	 esthetical	 approaches.	 We	 shall	 define
these	terms	as	follows:

The	 astrological	 approach	 deals	 with	 the	 beginning	 of	 all	 things	 and	 of	 all
cycles.	 The	 psychological	 approach	 refers	 to	 the	 study	 of	 the	 life-process—the
so-called	 “middle”	 of	 all	 cycles,	 the	 world	 of	 change.	 The	 esthetical	 approach
deals	with	the	ultimate	significance	and	ultimate	synthesis	of	all	that	is.

Such	 a	 new	 classification	 may	 be	 justified	 by	 the	 fact	 that	 during	 the	 last
thirty	 years	 religion,	 science,	 philosophy	 have	 experienced	 deep	 and	 vital
transformations.	 Religion,	 insofar	 as	 it	 is	 a	 practical	 approach	 to	 life	 based	 on
unity	and	identification	with	the	life	of	“God,”	should	refer	to	the	Monad,	to	the
beginning	and	principle	of	all	things.	Science	is	of	course	attempting	to	analyze
and	 discover	 the	 laws	 of	 the	 world-process	 of	 change,	 of	 universal	 life	 and	 its
myriads	 of	 transformations.	 We	 claim,	 though	 this	 is	 not	 the	 place	 to	 try	 to
substantiate	 such	 a	 claim,	 that	 science	 will	 have	 to	 use	 more	 and	 more
psychological	 methods	 as	 it	 finds	 that	 atoms	 and	 universes	 behave	 more	 and
more	 like	 personalities.	 Psychology,	 by	 the	 use	 of	 scientific	 methods,	 is	 being
prepared	for	the	task	of	“assimilating”	the	collective	data	of	modern	science.	As
for	 philosophy,	 we	 believe	 that	 its	 real	 function	 is	 to	 reveal	 the	 ultimate
significance	of	all	things	and	all	processes,	and	to	lead	to	the	great	synthesis	of
the	 end	 of	 the	 cycle—to	 the	 Wisdom	 that	 is	 the	 sum	 total,	 quintessence	 and
perfume	of	all	civilization—to	the	Beautiful.	For	Beauty	is	the	supreme	“body	of
significance,”	the	body	of	glory	and	perfection.

### By	the	foregoing	we	do	not	mean	that	astrology	will	turn	into	a	“religion	of

the	stars.”	Far	from	it—we	hope!	What	we	mean	is	that	in	its	search	for	the	“first
Cause”	 (that	 is,	 for	 the	 God-of-the-beginning	 or	 the	 universal	 Monad)	 religion
will	use	a	method	and	a	basis	of	thought	not	unlike	those	on	which	a	revaluated
astrology	 will	 be	 founded.	 The	 birth-chart	 of	 Humanity	 may	 eventually	 be	 a
known	fact;	and	when	the	cycles	of	precession	of	the	equinoxes,	and	other	large
cycles	are	really	studied,	man	may	be	able	to	behold	the	symbol	of	his	generic
being	and	destiny—the	Archetype	of	Man.	To	behold	this	Archetype	has	always
been	held	to	be	one	of	the	experiences	of	that	mysterious	process	called	by	the
true	 occultists	 “initiation.”	 But	 even	 initiation	 may	 become	 an	 experience	 of
Man-the-whole;	 and	 as	 this	 occurs	 “the	 old-fashioned	 religion”	 will	 evidently
become	 worthless.	 A	 symbolic	 intuition	 of	 the	 reality	 and	 destiny	 of	 Man,	 and
perhaps	of	our	entire	solar	system	(at	least	from	the	human	standpoint)	may	then
become	 possible.	 This	 would	 be	 “religion”—and	 at	 the	 same	 time	 the	 highest
possible	form	of	astrology.	Our	work	is	polarized	toward	this	distant	goal.	First,
we	must	learn	to	know	the	archetypal	symbol	of	every	human	being	and	destiny.
Then,	our	children	or	greatgrandchildren	may	glimpse	some	day	the	Archetype
of	Man-the-whole—not	in	mystical	ecstasy	or	through	occult	initiations,	but	in
the	clear	and	individual	consciousness	of	a	mind	fully	awakened	to	the	reality	of
symbols	and	one	with	the	Self.	A	mind	“pellucid	as	crystal,”	the	mind	of	fully
individuated	Personalities—of	Seed-Men.

In	closing,	we	shall	add	that	the	dualism	of	individual	and	collective—and	its
reconciling	operative	principle,	the	creative—can	be	traced	at	the	roots	of	most,
and	possibly	all,	philosophical	and	psychological	problems.	Our	claim	is	that	it
could	 serve	as	a	basic	 formula	 underlying	 the	 more	 specialized	formulas	 of	all
branches	 of	 knowledge,	 and	 thus	 as	 the	 keystone	 of	 an	 attempt	 at	 universal
integration.

The	relationship	of	individual	to	collective	is	obviously	the	foundation	of	all
the	 branches	 of	 the	 science	 and	 art	 of	 social	 organization—including	 politics,
sociology,	jurisprudence,	and,	we	would	add,	economics.	In	all	of	these	fields	the
goal	is	a	satisfactory	adjustment	of	individual	and	collectivity,	of	the	respective
rights	 and	 duty	 of	 the	 individual	 and	 the	 State.	 In	 economics,	 the	 basic
specialized	 dualism	 is	 that	 of	 production	 and	 consumption;	 but	 an	 equally
important	 factor	 is	 distribution.	 Consumption	 is	 a	 species	 of	 individuation;
distribution,	 of	 collectivation;	 production	 standing	 here	 for	 the	 creative.	 All
economic	ills	come	from	the	undue	relative	prominence	of	one	or	two	of	these
factors;	 in	 some	 cases,	 as	 at	 the	 present,	 a	 crisis	 is	 really	 caused	 by	 an	 over-

stimulation	of	all	three	factors	and	their	operation	at	a	new	level.	The	advent	of
machines	caused	a	deep	change	in	the	vital	meaning	of	“production”--ox	work.
Thus	humanity	has	to	readjust	itself	to	a	new	concept	of	the	significance	of	work
—from	 the	 physiological-muscular	 to	 the	 mental	 level.	 To	 grasp	 this	 is,	 we
believe,	 to	 grasp	 the	 whole	 pattern	 of	 social	 changes	 since	 the	 eighteenth
century.

Democracy	 was	 of	 course	 a	 novel	 emphasis	 on	 the	 individual	 factor	 in
human	society;	but	because	the	creative	duty	and	responsibility	of	the	individual
was	not	properly	stressed,	the	individual	factor	dominated	unduly	in	the	attitude
of	 “rugged	 individualism”	 and	 individual	 profit	 at	 the	 expense	 of	 proper
collectivation	(distribution	of	goods);	thus	trusts	and	monopolies	came	to	exist.
In	 reaction	 against	 the	 individual’s	 predominance,	 we	 see.	 in	 Communism.
Fascism,	Nazism	the	stressing	of	collective	and	generic	factors.

The	 emphasis	 on	 the	 creative	 is	 found	 in	 such	 movements	 as	 those	 for	 the
use	of	leisure,	for	community	music,	and	for	all	those	activities	which	reconcile
individual	and	collectivity.	Modern	law	is	also	being	founded	on	a	new	concept
of	the	relation	of	the	individual	to	the	collective,	shifting	to	the	collectivity	much
of	the	guilt	which	once	belonged	exclusively	to	the	individual,	and	emphasizing
the	value	of	the	creative—even	in	jail.

In	the	study	of	history	the	same	shift	is	clearly	recognizable,	and	individual
heroes	give	way	to	collective	trends,	to	economics	and	to	the	significance	of	this
or	 that	 type	 of	 work	 and	 production.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 collectivating
tendencies	 of	 later	 years	 react	 in	 mass	 psychology	 by	 making	 biographies	 the
most	 popular	 among	 books.	 The	 study	 of	 past	 cultures	 shows	 an	 alternation	 of
individual	and	collective	emphasis.	Alexandria	follows	Athens,	Christianity	the
Greek	 culture.	 From	 the	 broadest	 possible	 standpoint	 we	 might	 say	 that	 in	 old
Asia,	 India	 represents	 the	 individual	 focus;	 China,	 the	 collective;	 Indo-China
(Khmer	civilization	especially),	the	creative.

Such	 generalizations	 are	evidently	dangerous;	 but	they	 may	 bring	to	 man	a
sense	of	order	and	a	broad	vision	which	are	of	great	value	psychologically,	and
which	are	needed	to	compensate	the	attitude	and	mentality	of	the	man	lost	in	the
analysis	of	minute	phenomena	within	the	endless	and	apparently	formless	tide	of
change.	Form	comes	only	from	the	perception	of	beginnings	of	cycles,	and	from
the	intuition	of	their	ultimate	goal	and	significance.

Perhaps	 the	 most	 fascinating	 instance	 of	 the	 application	 of	 the	 principle	 of
relationship	 inherent	 in	 the	 trinity	 of	 individual,	 creative	 and	 collective	 is,

however,	to	be	found	in	the	new	physics.	We	refer	especially	to	the	dualism	of
wave	 and	 particle	 which	 seems	 to	 be	 the	 essence	 of	 light	 as	 well	 as	 of	 matter
(photons	 and	 electrons).	 We	 consider	 light	 as	 representing	 the	 creative.	 Time-
Space-Light	 parallel	 Individual-Collective-Creative,	 as	 we	 have	 already	 seen.
The	unit	of	light,	the	photon,	acts	under	certain	conditions	as	wave,	under	others
as	particle.	The	photon	is	the	unit	of	release	of	energy—which	refers	obviously
to	 the	 creative.	 Interestingly	 enough,	 all	 occult	 philosophies	 speak	 of	 the
primordial	Light,	and	of	the	human	monads	as	sparkles	within	this	Light.	Thus
photons.	 “Fohat”	 in	 Tibet,	 is	 the	 name	 of	 the	 universal	 Creative,	 whose
primordial	emanation	is	Light,

The	 atom	 is	 constituted	 by	 a	 nucleus	 and	 circling	 electrons.	 At	 first	 it	 was
thought	that	the	nucleus	was	strictly	positive	and	the	electrons	negative.	But	this
old	 Yang-Yin	 dualism	 is	 giving	 way	 to	 a	 new	 kind:	 the	 nucleus	 represents	 the
collective,	 the	 electron,	 the	 individual.	 The	 photon	 is	 the	 creative,	 and	 the
quantum	 the	 law	 of	 creative	 emanation.	 Once	 released,	 the	 unit	 of	 energy
deteriorates	 into	 various	 types	 of	 rays,	 just	 as	 the	 emanated	 image,	 or	 idea,
becomes	 a	 collective	 element	 assimilated	 by	 other	 units.	 It	 may	 be	 that	 such	 a
formulation	is	not	the	correct	one,	and	that	intra-atomic	physics	is	still	to	a	large
extent	terra	 incognita.	 Yet	 we	 believe	 that	 the	basic	 dualism	 which	 we	 present
can	find	its	place	as	a	philosophical	(ultimate)	interpretation	of	atomic	structure.
Another	important	point	is	that	the	new	physics	seems,	at	least,	to	lead	us	to
infer	 that	 no	 science	 of	 the	 individual	 is	 possible,	 only	 statistical	 science	 of
groups.	It	may	even	be	better	to	say,	science	of	the	interaction	of	individual	and
group-—which	 is	 what	 we	 called	 the	 life-process.	 All	 empirical	 science,	 we
believe,	deals	with,	and	deals	only	with,	the	life-process—and	the	essence	of	this
process	is	the	constant	adjustment	of	individual	and	collective.	In	this	sense,	the
life-process	 deals	 always	 with	 “personalities”—that	 is,	 balance-sheets.	 Our
universe	 is	 a	 credit	 universe.	 Death	 is	 bankruptcy.	 Entropy	 and	 the	 “running
down	of	the	universe”	are	concepts	of	the	Depression!

We	could	go	on	and	on	dealing	with	similar	philosophical	interpretations;	but
space	(the	collective	preoccupation!)	forbids	us	this	(individual)	pleasure.	As	a
last	 thought,	 and	 as	 a	 fitting	 coda	 to	 a	 study	 which	 dealt	 primarily	 with	 the
establishment	 of	 a	 universal	 Formula	 of	 the	 Cycle,	 we	 shall	 refer	 the	 reader	 to
the	 beautiful	 archaic	 invocation	 heard	 throughout	 Tibet:	 OM	 MANI	 PADME
HUM.	 This	 “magical	 formula”	 is	 a	 formula	 of	 the	 whole	 life-process,	 as
sketched	 out	 in	 this	 chapter.	 OM	 is	 the	 monad	 of	 the	 beginning—the	 Original
Impulse	of	the	cycle.	MANI	refers	to	the	creative	mind,	to	that	central	“jewel”

which	 is	 the	 creative	 principle.	 PADME	 means	 “lotus,”	 and	 symbolizes
completion,	 synthesis,	 individuation,	 the	 brotherhood	 of	 the	 end	 from	 which
emanates	 “perfume”	 or	 the	 quintessence	 of	 the	 life-process—in	 a	 sense,
consciousness.	HUM	is	the	emanated	perfume,	the	withdrawal	of	the	completed
body	into	the	quintessence	and	the	abstract.	In	all	14,	or	twice	7	letters;	7	being
the	number	of	the	life-process—which	is	twofold.

Thus:	OM,	the	Jewel	within	the	Lotus,	HUM!	That	is:	In	the	One	arises	the
Creative;	 and	 through	 the	 operation	 of	 the	 Creative,	 the	 collective	 is	 gathered
into	the	synthesis;	and	from	the	synthesis,	emanates	the	quintessence,	the	Idea,
whose	energy	is	again	the	One.

*	 Thus	 concentration	 on	 the	 solar	 plexus	 is	 practised	 where	 man	 is	 willing	 to	 become	 a	 more	 or	 less
passive	agent	to	a	“primordial	image”	or	“god.”	The	solar	plexus	is	ruled	astrologically	by	Jupiter,	which
symbolizes	 religious	 worship,	 contact	 with	 the	 “gods,”	 and	 in	 general	 is	 the	 reflection	 of	 the	 universally
collective—Parabrahman	or	the	Para	condition	of	consciousness	in	Hindu	philosophy.

## A	KEY	TO	ASTROLOGICAL	SYMBOLISM

As	we	come	to	consider	more	specifically	and	practically	the	field	of	astrological
symbolism,	as	we	study	the	significance	of	its	many	elements,	we	shall	find	that
the	concepts	presented	in	the	preceding	chapters	will	enable	us	to	interpret	in	a
consistent,	 logical	 and	 natural	 manner	 the	 sequence	 of	 astrological	 factors.
Especially	shall	we	find	that	the	opposition	between	individual	and	collective	is
the	 most	 wonderful	 key	 to	 the	 vital	 and	 practical	 understanding	 of	 astrological
elements,	 which	 are	 usually	 produced	 in	 pairs	 of	 opposite	 polarities.	 At	 first,
astrology	 may	 appear	 as	 a	 thoroughly	 dualistic	 system,	 very	 much	 like	 the
Chinese	system	of	the	Yi	King.	But	it	will	be	easy	for	us	to	point	out	that	behind
this	 obvious	 dualism	 there	 is	 always	 to	 be	 found	 a	 third	 term,	 integrating	 the
opposites.	And	this	is	perhaps	the	most	important	point	in	this	re-formulation	of
astrology:	That	it	consistently	reveals	a	way	to	integration,	a	factor	of	individual
significance	 which,	 if	 creatively	 used,	 can	 lead	 us	 to	 see	 the	 wholeness	 of	 any
whole,	 the	 flash	 of	 creative	 light	 which	 alone	 can	 integrate	 the	 opposites,	 and
thus	make	them	significant.

### Signatures	and	Significant	Facts

“To	make	significant”	is	to	visualize	each	and	all	situations	or	entities	which
one	meets	as	signs	of	the	workings	of	Spirit.	In	each	of	the	smallest	details	of	the
world-pattern	one	may	see	at	work	the	Wholeness	of	the	whole;	one	may	sense
all	 the	 basic	 forces	 which	 are	 the	 warp	 and	 woof	 of	 the	 life-cycle,	 of	 any	 life-
cycle.	 In	 any	 situation,	 in	 any	 organic	 entity,	 all	 these	 forces	 operate;	 just	 as
every	moment	is	the	synthesis	of	all	past	moments	and	the	source	of	all	future
moments.	The	whole	is	active	everywhere.

But	 how	 to	 see	 this	 action?	 How	 to	 penetrate	 the	 “veil	 of	 illusion”	 which
covers	every	separate	entity	and	seems	to	make	of	it	something	unrelated	to	all
the	 rest?	 How	 to	 get	 at	 the	 interior	 pattern,	 the	 particular	 arrangement	 of

universal	 elements	 which	 is	 the	 “real”	 being?	 What	 is	 implied	 in	 this	 is	 the
power	to	deal	with	situations	or	living	entities	as	wholes;	a	power	to	which	we
have	 already	 referred.	 It	 is	 instinct	 at	 the	 unconscious	 level.	 It	 is	 intuition,	 or
holistic	 perception,	 or	 “clair-seeing”	 (not	 ordinary	 clairvoyance!)	 at	 the
conscious	 level.	 It	 is	 the	 power	 to	 see	 universal	 life-patterns	 at	 work	 in	 the
functioning	of	particular	organisms	or	processes.

In	every	man—for	instance—individual,	collective	and	creative	operate,	but
of	 course	 in	 most	 varied	 proportions.	 An	 ordinary	 onlooker	 is	 attracted	 by	 the
apparently	unique	outer	result	of	the	blend.	He	is	unable	to	analyze	the	forces	at
work,	to	grasp	the	significance	of	their	combination.	The	man	is	just	Mr.	So-and-
So.	The	“seer”	sees	in	this	man	a	special	focalization	of	a	number	of	basic	life-
principles,	and	he	is	able	to	“place”	every	life-principle	where	it	belongs,	tracing
back	 his	 ancestry	 by	 implications,	 grasping	 at	 once	 the	 sum	 total	 of	 the	 man’s
connections	with	the	universal	whole.	He	sees	thus	the	significance	of	the	man;
and	besides,	he	sees	also	the	significance	of	the	man’s	relation	to	him.

Instinct	 gives	 all	 this	 knowledge	 to	 the	 animal	 who	 acts	 accordingly—yet
does	not	know	why	he	acts.	Everything	for	the	animal	carries	a	life-significance.
It	is	the	sign	of	some	basic	fact	of	life.	These	facts	are	few,	yet	where	they	are
concerned	the	animal	is	“clair-seeing.”	Every	feature	of	a	situation	or	of	a	person
is	read	as	a	“Signature”	of	the	life	which	is	focalized	in	and	through	it.

The	 medieval	 alchemists	 laid	 a	 great	 emphasis	 upon	 this	 theory	 of
Signatures,	 following	 in	 that	 the	 old	 Chinese	 tradition—if	 not	 the	 universal
tradition	of	archaic	mankind.	The	form	and	features	of	plant,	rock,	tree,	animal,
face,	etc.,	were	considered	as	a	Signature	of	the	indwelling	spirit.	The	alchemist
was	 supposed	 to	 be	 an	 expert	 graphologist	 deciphering	 at	 once	 the	 Signature;
from	the	Sign	going	straight	to	the	life;	from	symbol,	to	reality.

The	signature	of	a	man	is	usually	not	legal	unless	it	contains	the	individual
first	name,	and	the	family	(collective)	name.	It	also	contains	usually	some	other
characteristic	or	line	which	refers	to	the	rhythm	of	the	individual—that	is,	to	the
creative	factor	in	him.

This,	of	course,	is	only	an	amusing	symbol—many	will	say.	Truly,	but	why
“only”	a	symbol?	It	is	by	perceiving	the	value	of	such	symbols	that	life	is	made
significant.	Every	 object	 and	every	situation	becomes	 signs	of	 the	sum	total	of
connections	 relating	 object	 and	 situation	 to	 the	 universal	 whole.	 The	 attention
given	by	man	to	such	an	object	at	once	focalizes	in	it	the	whole	life-process.	The
drama	of	universal	life	is	seen	performed	on	that	tiny	stage,	which	thus	becomes

a	microcosm-—an	image	of	the	whole.

Again,	it	is	the	same	thing	that	occurs	in	a	truly	instinctual	action.	The	actor
is	not	merely	one	puny	little	animal.	It	is	the	whole	animal	species,	and	behind	it
the	 whole	 planetary	 being,	 that	 acts.	 The	 whole	 of	 life	 is	 focalized	 in	 an
instinctual	performance:	depth	and	depth	of	significance—but	no	consciousness
to	see	it	as	significant	It	is	natural—but	not	significant,	until	man	arrives	on	the
stage	and	“sees”	in	it	the	Signature	of	eternal	and	universal	principles.

As	we	shall	see,	time	after	time,	an	astrological	birth-chart	is	a	true	Signature
—and	must	be	read	as	such.	One	must	find	in	it	the	individual	and	the	collective
names—plus	the	sign	of	the	creative.	But	now	we	have	not	yet	come	to	the	point
of	 discussing	 chart-interpretation.	 There	 is,	 before	 we	 reach	 this	 point,	 another
Signature	to	decipher:	the	Signature	of	the	Earth-being.

The	Earth	is	the	Signature	of	that	planetary	Whole	in	which	men	“live	and
have	their	being”	as	mere	cells	of	a	vast	body.	All	collective—or	rather	generic
—values	in	man	come	from	the	Earth.	It	may	be	that	the	Earth	is	the	body	of	a
cosmic	Spiritual	entity,	the	Planetary	Logos	(as	occultists	call	Him).	But	for	all
that	we	know	and	as	far	as	we	can	ascertain	facts,	the	Earth	is	to	be	considered
as	 the	 vast	 matrix	 of	 Man-the-whole.	 Mankind	 spreads	 all	 over	 the	 globe.	 To
understand	the	Earth	is	to	understand	mankind.	As	every	single	human	being	is	a
representative	 of	 mankind,	 then	 the	 first	 thing	 to	 do,	 before	 we	 can	 hope	 to
understand	a	particular	man	in	terms	of	universal	connections	and	principles,	is
to	understand	the	Earth.	The	Earth	as	a	Signature.	We	must	read	every	letter	of
the	 names	 and	 understand	 all	 the	 facts	 of	 the	 Earth.	 They	 must	 become
significant	to	us.	How	the	Earth	moves,	its	positions,	its	speed,	its	connections
with	all	that	moves	around	it,	its	relation	to	the	Sun	whence	it	apparently	came:
All	 these	 things	 must	 become	 Signatures.	 Astrology	 is	 to	 be	 made	 of	 all	 these
significant	facts	of	the	Earth.	It	cannot	leave	the	Earth,	for	that	would	be	leaving
the	realm	of	facts.	And	astrology	deals	only	with	facts—but	facts	that	are	seen	as
Signatures	of	the	life	of	the	Earth.

There	 are	 evidently	 many	 kinds	 of	 facts.	 The	 astrologer,	 being	 originally	 a
“seer,”	will	be	able	to	see	clearly	what	facts	have	life	significance,	what	facts	are
purely	superficial.	Moreover,	astrology	being	only	one	of	many	possible	systems
of	 life-symbolism	 can	 operate	 only	 through	 a	 certain	 category	 of	 facts.	 These
facts	 are	 first	 of	 all	 those	 which	 affect	 or	 are	 experienceable	 by	 human	 beings
living	on	the	surface	of	the	globe.	No	fact	is	susceptible	of	being	a	Signature	for
man	unless	man	can	experience	it	and	actually	see	it,	directly	or	indirectly.	For

instance,	Uranus	and	Neptune	had	no	value	as	Signatures	until	men	saw	them.	If
there	are	 planets	besides	 those	we	know	now,	they	have	no	meaning	for	us,	as
long	 as	 they	 are	 not	 facts	 to	 be	 experienced,	 whether	 with	 the	 naked	 eye	 or
through	a	telescope.	Nothing	can	be	a	symbol	unless	it	has	become	the	object	of
a	significant	experience.

This	 being	 understood,	 we	 shall	 begin	 to	 study	 the	 category	 of	 facts	 of	 the
Earth-life	 which	 are	 the	 most	 significant	 to	 mankind.	 These	 facts—such	 as
seasons,	 climates,	 etc.—are	 all	 the	 results	 of	 the	 various	 motions	 of	 the	 Earth.
These	 motions	 will	 prove	 to	 be	 the	 material	 on	 which	 astrology	 draws	 for	 its
symbolism.	 Each	 motion	 will	 be	 seen	 as	 the	 Signature	 of	 one	 of	 the	 most
fundamental	principles	of	life	and	being.

### Motion:	Subjective	and	Objective

We	have	repeatedly	established	the	proposition	that	astrology	is	the	algebra
of	 life.	 What	 may	 as	 yet	 not	 have	 received	 enough	 attention	 is	 the	 fact	 that
essentially	life	is	cyclic	motion.	In	preceding	chapters	we	spoke	of	the	trinity	of
time,	space	and	light;	and	under	the	term	“light”	we	included	all	energies	which
essentially	 constitute	 “life.”	 Light	 and	 life	 are,	 philosophically	 as	 well	 as
practically,	synonymous.	Underneath	both	we	can	perceive,	by	a	further	process
of	abstraction,	the	element	of	motion.	Motion,	space	and	time	constitute	an	old
metaphysical	trinity,	which	is	as	fundamental	as	can	ever	be	conceived.	“Being”
is	 the	 synthesis	 of	 all	 three.	 But	 what	 we	 call	 more	 particularly	 “life”	 is
symbolized	by	the	element	of	motion.	In	ancient	symbolism,	this	motion	that	is
Life	was	referred	to	as	the	“Great	Breath,”	the	in-and	out-breathing	of	Brahma,
the	 Creator.	 But	 in	 our	 present	 astrological	 symbolism	 we	 are	 dealing	 with
another	kind	of	dualism	of	motion.

All	 motions	 necessitate	 actually	 space	 and	 time.	 Yet,	 philosophically
speaking,	 it	 is	 necessary	 to	 distinguish	 between	 two	 types	 of	 motion:	 Motion
which	 does	 not	 involve	 displacement	 of	 the	 center	 of	 the	 being,	 and	 motion
which	 does	 involve	 such	 a	 displacement.	 These	 two	 types	 are	 simple	 to
recognize,	when	thus	described,	as	we	find	them	exemplified	most	obviously	in
the	behavior	of	celestial	bodies.	Every	planet	rotates	around	its	axis	(first	type)
and	circles	around	the	sun	(second	type).	These	two	types	give	us	a	new	dualism
of	life-direction,	and	it	fits	in	most	logically	with	our	dualism	of	individual	and
collective.

The	 first	 type	 of	 motion	 can	 be	 called	 “motion	 in	 time”	 or	 “subjective
motion”	as	it	does	not	create	any	change	of	location	of	the	body	as	a	whole.	It	is

motion	within	the	confines	of	the	self;	thus,	by	extension,	interior	or	subjective
motion.	 It	 symbolizes	 inner	 changes,	 and	 what	 Bergson	 calls	 real	 time	 or
duration—the	series	of	modifications	of	interior	states	of	consciousness.	It	refers
to	subjective	being,	to	the	individual.

The	 second	 type	 of	 motion,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 is	 definitely	 “motion	 in
space”	 or	 “objective	 motion”	 as	 it	 brings	 about	 change	 in	 location	 and
displacement	 of	 the	 center	 of	 the	 being.	 It	 is	 visible,	 tangible	 motion	 through
space.	Space,	as	we	saw	in	a	previous	chapter,	is	a	framework	for	the	interplay	of
relationships	of	parts	within	a	whole.	It	is	the	substratum	for	all	relationships,	for
all	interchanges.	Through	motion	in	space,	through	actual	displacement	of	one’s
own	 center,	 one	 relates	 oneself	 to	 others,	 one	 gains	 concrete,	 objective
experiences	 of	 others,	 one	 also	 becomes	 aware	 of	 the	 reality	 of	 the	 larger
collective	whole	of	which	one	is	but	a	part.

Thus	 we	 have	 exemplified	 in	 the	 main	 motions	 of	 celestial	 bodies	 our
dualism	 of	 individual	 and	 collective.	 Our	 “algebra	 of	 life”	 will	 use	 these	 two
types	 of	 motion	 as	 the	 very	 foundation	 for	 its	 symbolism.	 Axial	 rotation	 and
orbital	revolution	will	be	the	two	pillars	upon	which	the	temple	of	astrological
symbolism	 will	 rest—a	 temple	 of	 Doric	 simplicity,	 once	 it	 is	 understood	 in	 its
balanced	wholeness	and	in	the	logic	of	its	construction.	Astrology	is	a	study	in
significant	motion.	It	symbolically	interprets	the	motions	of	celestial	bodies	and
relates	 them	 to	 the	 movements	 of	 the	 life-force	 within	 all	 organisms	 and	 all
cycles.	 These	 movements	 of	 the	 life-force	 are	 represented	 both	 by	 a	 series	 of
states	 of	 consciousness	 and	 by	 a	 series	 of	 organic	 events;	 by	 what	 happens
within	 the	 individual,	 and	 by	 occurrences	 having	 significance	 in	 terms	 of	 the
collective.

The	basis	of	this	study	in	significant	motion	is	of	course	the	Earth;	the	Earth
not	so	much	as	a	material	object,	but	rather	as	the	symbol	of	Man,	the	interpreter
and	symbolizer.	Astrology,	as	we	present	it,	is	necessarily	“anthropocentric,”	that
is,	centered	around	Man.	It	is	an	effort	made	by	Man	to	reduce	the	bewildering
maze	 of	 life-appearances	 into	 complex	 series	 of	 ordered	 and	 cyclic	 motions.
Astrology	in	its	deeper	aspect	is	that	effort	of	Man	to	give	to	Nature,	within	as
well	as	without,	the	meaning	of	order,	of	cosmos.	All	sciences,	of	course,	work
toward	this	goal.	But	astrology,	which	very	likely	antedates	them	all,	pursues	the
goal	 in	 a	 broader	 and	 more	 structural	 way	 than	 any	 other	 method	 of	 thought,
because	 it	 is	 not	 a	 mere	 science,	 tabulating	 facts;	 but	 is	 also	 a	 philosophy
interpreting	these	facts	in	terms	of	ideas—	and	an	art	applying	the	interpretations
to	individual	cases.

Every	type	of	creative	interpretation	must	be	centered	around	the	interpreter.
The	 individual	 is	 the	 foundation	 for	 all	 creative	 interpretation.	 In	 astrology
everything	 consequently	 is	 referred	 to	 the	 point,	 in	 time	 and	 space,	 of	 the
observer,	 or	 of	 the	 native.	 A	 birth-chart	 is	 the	 universe	 seen	 from	 the	 point,	 in
time	and	space,	of	the	birth-event.	The	native	whose	birth-chart	is	interpreted	is
seen	at	the	center	of	his	own	universe.	The	fact	of	birth,	its	position	in	space	and
its	 moment	 in	 time,	 creates	 a	 universe	 around	 itself.	 Every	 factor	 of
interpretation	revolves	around	this	birth-fact.

As	men	live	on	the	whole	surface	of	the	Earth,	and	not	merely	at	one	spot	on
the	 globe,	 the	 Earth	 as	 a	 whole	 has	 to	 be	 considered	 the	 symbol	 of	 Man.	 The
rhythms	 of	 the	 Earth	 motions	 will	 be	 used	 to	 symbolize	 the	 rhythms	 of	 the
generic	 human	 being.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 an	 individual	 man	 is	 born	 at	 a
particular	point	of	the	Earth	surface;	and	therefore,	while	generic	mankind	is	not
affected	by	the	axial	rotation	of	the	Earth,	the	individual	selfhood	of	a	particular
man	 will	 be	 determined	 in	 function	 of	 this	 very	 axial	 rotation.	 In	 other	 words,
there	is	no	day	or	night	(the	results	of	axial	rotation)	for	mankind	as	a	whole,	as
it	is	always	day	for	one	half	of	mankind	and	night	for	the	other	half.	But	there	is
day	and	night	for	a	particular	man	occupying	a	particular	place	on	the	surface	of
the	globe.	On	the	other	hand,	the	relationship	(aspects)	of	the	Earth	to	the	other
planets	of	the	system	have	exactly	the	same	significance	for	collective	Man	and
for	 any	 individual	 man,	 except	 that	 the	 position	 of	 the	 individual	 man	 on	 the
globe’s	surface	will	focalize	these	aspects	in	a	section	of	his	own	heavens	either
below	 or	 above	 the	 horizon,	 and	 more	 precisely	 in	 what	 astrology	 calls	 one	 of
the	“houses.”

Thus	 all	 values	 which	 deal	 with	 the	 individual	 and	 his	 problems	 of
consciousness	as	an	individual	will	be	referred	symbolically	to	the	axial	rotation
of	the	Earth	and	to	the	astrological	factors	created	thereby,	mainly	the	circle	of
houses	 and	 its	 two	 axes,	 vertical	 and	 horizontal.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 collective
values	which	pertain	to	the	behavior	of	man	as	a	racial	and	generic	being	will	be
referred	 to	 the	 orbital	 yearly	 revolution	 of	 the	 Earth	 around	 the	 Sun.	 It	 is	 this
orbital	revolution	which	constantly	alters	the	relationship	of	the	Earth	to	the	Sun
and	to	the	planets.	As	the	latter	also	revolve	around	the	Sun,	a	complex	pattern
of	planetary	motions	and	of	consequent	relationships	is	produced.	It	is	in	order	to
be	able	to	chart	such	a	constantly	changing	pattern	that	the	idea	of	the	“zodiac”
originated,	or	at	least	is	to	be	used	in	an	astrology	reformulated	at	an	abstract	and
symbolic	level.	The	zodiac	becomes	thus	a	series	of	points	of	references	which
enables	us	to	plot	accurately	the	position	of	all	planets	and	of	the	Sun	in	relation

to	the	orbital	motion	of	the	Earth.	It	is	this	motion	which	creates	the	cycle	of	the
year.

### Day	and	Year—Individual	and	Collective

The	collective	meaning	of	the	year-cycle	will	be	more	evident	if	we	realize
that	because	of	the	inclination	of	the	Earth’s	axis	(which	is	not	perpendicular	to
the	 Earth’s	 orbit)	 the	 angle	 of	 incidence	 of	 the	 Sun	 rays	 varies	 throughout	 the
year,	 causing	 the	 change	 of	 seasons.	 Seasons	 and	 climates	 affect	 the	 collective
being	and	consciousness	of	human	races	and	groups.	They	affect	the	growth	and
development	of	bodies	and	of	all	physiological	elements—which	belong	to	the
collective	realm.

The	 year-cycle	 is	 truly	 of	 great	 importance	 in	 the	 development	 of	 the
individual;	but	it	is	so	mostly	in	terms	of	the	physiological	growth	or	decay	of
the	 earthly	 body,	 in	 terms	 of	 periodical	 modifications	 of	 the	 vital	 forces	 of	 the
body.	The	vegetable	and	animal	energies	in	man	are	subjected	to	it—especially
the	former,	as	the	latter	are	even	more	strongly	connected	perhaps	with	the	lunar
tides.	 The	 Great	 Sympathetic	 nervous	 system	 dominated	 by	 the	 solar	 plexus	 is
strongly	 influenced	 by	 this	 yearly	 rhythm,	 which	 also	 affects	 the	 inflow	 of	 the
energies	of	the	“collective	unconscious”	into	the	conscious,

It	 could	 be	 added	 that,	 as	 the	 Bible	 says,	 a	 day	 of	 the	 Lord	 is	 like	 unto	 a
human	year.	This	means	that	the	Lord	(the	collective	Race-spirit:	Jehovah)	finds
his	unit-cycle	of	individual	selfhood	in	the	year.	For	the	collective	consciousness
of	 Man-the-whole	 the	 orbital	 revolution	 of	 the	 Earth	 around	 the	 Sun	 means	 a
“day.”	 The	 “day”	 is	 always	 the	 unit	 of	 selfhood.	 The	 self	 of	 collective	 Man
operates	 through	 a	 basic	 unit:	 the	 orbital	 cycle.	 The	 self	 of	 an	 individual	 man
operates	through	a	basic	unit:	the	axial-rotation	cycle.

### The	Great	Polar	Cycle

Besides	these,	there	is	another	basic	cycle:	the	cycle	of	the	precession	of	the
equinoxes.	It	should	rather	be	called	the	“Great	Polar	Cycle.”	It	is	created	by	a
peculiar	 gyrating	 motion	 of	 the	 Earth’s	 axis,	 which	 can	 be	 compared	 to	 the
motion	 of	 a	 schoolboy’s	 top.	 This	 gyrating	 motion	 changes	 very	 slowly	 the
direction	of	the	polar	axis,	and	consequently	the	points	where	the	Earth’s	equator
cuts	the	plane	of	the	ecliptic	(the	apparent	yearly	path	of	the	Sun).	Thus	on	one
hand	 the	 North	 Pole	 points	 successively	 to	 a	 series	 of	 stars,	 describing	 a
complete	 circle	 in	 about	 25,868	 years;	 on	 the	 other,	 the	 vernal	 point	 (Spring
Equinox)	shifts	backwards	among	 the	constellations	(thus	the	term	“precession

of	the	equinoxes”)	along	the	circle	of	the	ecliptic.

The	important	fact,	however,	is	that	the	polar	axis	of	the	Earth	points	to	one
star	 after	 another.	 The	 Pole	 Star	 changes:	 now	 it	 is	 Polaris	 in	 the	 constellation
Ursa	 Minor,	 but	 in	 5,000	 years	 it	 will	 be	 Alpha	 Cephei.	 According	 to
astronomical-telluric	 facts,	 the	 North	 and	 South	 poles	 of	 the	 earth	 represent
respectively	 the	 ingress	 and	 egress	 of	 cosmic	 magnetic	 energies.	 Interpreting
this,	esoteric	tradition	has	always	referred	to	the	North	Pole	as	the	gates	through
which	 cosmic	 Power	 flowed	 into	 the	 Earth,	 and	 as	 the	 symbol	 of	 divine
Consciousness.	 In	 this,	 very	 likely,	 a	 simile	 was	 established	 between	 the	 polar
axis	of	the	Earth	and	man’s	spine,	which	is	the	“rod	of	power”	through	which	the
energy	of	spirit	operates	within	man.	The	North	Pole	corresponds	then	to	the	top
of	the	head,	to	the	mysterious	center	which,	when	fully	functioning	is	perfected
men,	is	surrounded	with	a	sort	of	halo—not	unlike	the	Northern	Lights	at	their
best.

To	say	that	this	“rod	of	power”	of	the	Earth	alters	its	direction	is	to	say	that
the	quality	of	cosmic	power	received	by	the	Earth	changes	cyclically,	following
the	 gyrating	 motion	 of	 the	 Earth’s	 axis.	 Now,	 the	 interesting	 point	 is	 that	 this
gyration	does	not	mean	a	displacement	of	the	center	of	the	Earth.	It	belongs	thus
to	 our	 first	 category	 of	 “motion	 in	 time”	 or	 “subjective	 motion.”	 But	 the
“subject”	here	involved	is	the	Individual	whose	physical	center	is	one	with	the
center	of	the	Earth,	that	is	to	say,	the	great	planetary	Whole	already	spoken	of.
The	 polar	 axis,	 symbolically	 at	 least,	 is	 the	 “I	 AM”	 of	 this	 great	 planetary
Whole.	As	it	moves	about,	it	changes	its	relation	to	stars	with	which	it	appears	to
be	connected.	In	other	words,	the	very	selfhood	of	the	planetary	Whole	modifies
itself,	 attunes	 itself	 to	 different	 cosmic	 tones.	 These	 changes	 of	 planetary
selfhood	constitute	the	reality	of	what	we	call	“Piscean	Age,”	“Aquarian	Age,”
etc.,	by	reference	to	the	precession	of	the	equinoxes—a	secondary	effect,	not	a
cause.

Thus	the	“day”	is	the	unit-cycle	of	individual	man,	a	denizen	of	the	surface
of	this	globe	which	must	rotate	to	have	all	its	points	illumined	daily	by	the	noon-
sun	(save	the	polar	regions).	The	“year”	is	the	unit-cycle	of	collective	Man,	an
aggregate	of	beings	spread	all	around	the	surface	of	the	globe.	The	“Great	Polar
Cycle”	is	the	unit-cycle	of	the	planetary	Individual,	whose	center	is	one	with	the
center	of	the	Earth.*

With	 this	 last	 cycle	 we	 deal	 with	 what	 might	 be	 called	 the	 cosmically
Creative.	Every	“Age,”	such	as	the	Piscean	Age,	starts	with	a	release	of	cosmic

creative	powers	which	become	 the	col-lectivated	materials	which	men	will	use
for	 the	 building	 of	 civilizations.	 It	 is	 by	 considering	 this	 that	 we	 may	 better
understand	 the	 two	 ways	 in	 which	 this	 gyration	 of	 the	 Earth’s	 axis	 operates.
Changing	the	Pole	Star	means	changing	the	direction	of	the	axis	proper—which
is	 one	 thing.	 Another	 thing	 is	 changing	 the	 zodiacal	 location	 of	 the	 equinoxes.
The	former	refers	to	the	polar	axis-axis	of	spiritual	integration;	the	latter	refers	to
the	 equator—circle	 or	 belt	 of	 physiological	 vitalization.	 This	 dualism	 of	 polar
axis	and	equator	is	a	most	important	one,	and	will	be	studied	presently.

These	two	factors	are	ordinarily	not	clearly	separated,	and	this	may	account
for	 much	 of	 the	 confusion	 concerning	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 “Aquarian	 Age.”	 It
may	be	that	the	polar	axis	in	its	motion	has	already	become	connected	with	the
“new	 star”	 (or	 whatever	 it	 may	 be!)	 which	 symbolizes	 the	 spiritual	 creative
impulse	 of	 the	 new	 era.	 And	 yet	 the	 Sun	 may	 not	 have	 yet	 reached,	 by
precessional	 movement	 of	 the	 Equinoxes,	 the	 constellation	 Aquarius—	 which
would	 refer	 to	 the	 physiological	 vitalization	 and	 manifestation	 of	 the	 creative
impulse	of	the	new	era.	In	other	words,	while	the	spiritually	creative	impulse	is
already	upon	us,	it	may	take	a	little	more	time	before	the	vital	forces	building	the
outer	structures	of	the	new	era	operate	fully.

For	 some	 peculiar	 reason	 (yet	 quite	 representative	 of	 the	 development	 of
present-day	 mankind)	 we	 lay	 all	 the	 emphasis	 on	 the	 aspect	 of	 physiological
manifestation—that	which	deals	with	the	relation	of	the	equator	to	the	ecliptic—
and	we	forget	the	spiritual	creative	aspect—that	which	deals	with	the	motion	of
the	polar	axis.	What	we	should	study,	and	what	the	future	occult	astrology	will
study,	 is	 the	 circle	 described	 by	 the	 poles	 during	 the	 25,868-year	 period—our
“Great	Polar	Cycle.”

### Centers	of	Motion

In	 the	 foregoing	 we	 have	 dealt	 briefly	 with	 the	 three	 fundamental	 types	 of
Earth-motion.	 One	 more	 important	 point	 must	 be	 made	 clear,	 which	 is	 that	 all
cyclic	 motions	 (the	 only	 ones	 considered	 in	 life-symbolism)	 must	 gain	 their
significance	from	the	meaning	attributed	to	the	center	of	such	motions.	The	daily
rotation	 of	 the	 Earth	 has	 the	 polar	 axis	 of	 the	 Earth	 as	 its	 “center.”	 The	 yearly
revolution	of	the	Earth	is	centered	around	the	Sun.*	As	for	the	gyrating	motion
of	the	Earth’s	axis,	it	is	actually	centered	around	the	pole	of	the	ecliptic;	that	is	to
say,	the	exact	perpendicular	to	the	plane	of	the	earth’s	orbit—an	abstraction,	but
a	significant	one.

The	abstract	line	connecting	the	two	poles	of	the	Earth	is	the	axis	of	rotation
of	 our	 planet.	 This	 axis	 is	 thus	 to	 be	 considered	 as	 the	 “center”	 of	 the	 daily-
rotation	 cycle.	 As	 already	 mentioned,	 this	 polar	 axis	 symbolizes	 the	 line	 of
power	of	the	planet,	just	as	the	human	spine	represents	the	line	of	power	of	the
human	 being.	 This	 “power”	 is	 the	 power	 to	 be	 an	 individual	 self,	 an	 “I.”	 The
polar	axis	is	the	line	of	manifestation	of	the	I	AM	of	the	planet	considered	as	a
cosmic	 being.	 Through	 this	 line	 flows	 the	 power	 to	 be	 an	 individual	 self.	 In	 a
general	sense,	it	refers	to	the	cerebro-spinal	nerve-system.	 Therefore	the	cyclic
motion	of	the	Earth’s	globe	around	this	axis	must	refer	to	the	cyclic	development
of	the	individual	selfhood	of	all	beings	living	on	the	Earth-surface,	or	within	the
Earth’s	 globe,	 and	 susceptible	 of	 being	 “individuals.”	 This	 needs	 to	 be	 so
because	 of	 the	 very	 principle	 of	 “holistic	 logic”	 —the	 logic	 of	 symbolism—
which	we	discussed	in	our	chapter	“Astrology	Faces	Modern	Thought.”

In	astrological	symbolism	this	axial	rotation	of	the	Earth	is	charted	by	means
of	 the	 circle	 or	 wheel	 of	 houses.	 The	 twelve	 houses	 are	 twelve	 phases	 of	 this
daily	motion	of	the	Earth.	As	we	said	that	such	a	motion	should	be	considered	as
“subjective	 motion”	 or	 “motion	 in	 time,”	 it	 follows	 that	 the	 circle	 of	 houses
should	 be	 understood	 more	 specifically	 as	 the	 dial	 of	 a	 clock.	 This	 “dial	 of
houses”	 refers	 thus	 more	 particularly	 to	 a	 sequential	 development—the
development	of	man’s	individual	selfhood	throughout	his	life.

We	must	keep	in	mind	that,	philosophically	speaking,	what	makes	this	daily
rotation	necessary	is	the	fact	of	the	Earth	being	a	vast	globe	of	solid	and	opaque
substance.	As	men	live	on	the	surface	of	this	globe,	they	find	their	awareness	of
the	 universe	 (and	 of	 life	 in	 general)	 restricted	 to	 a	 half	 of	 its	 wholeness.	 The
solid	 Earth	 shuts	 from	 our	 eyes	 half	 of	 the	 world	 of	 being.	 This	 fact	 at	 once
becomes	 interpreted	 symbolically	 as	 the	 need	 for	 normal	 physical	 man	 to
experience	alternately	a	period	of	manifestation	and	one	of	non-manifestation.	In
terms	of	daily	living	this	means	waking	consciousness	and	sleep.

Because	the	Earth	shuts	out	from	man’s	self	half	of	the	universe,	the	Earth
must	 rotate	 in	 order	 to	 bring	 to	 every	 creature	 living	 on	 its	 surface	 each	 day	 a
whole	 vision	 of	 the	 world.	 Thus	 at	 the	 moment	 of	 birth	 the	 wheel	 of	 the
horoscope	 will	 represent	 a	 projection	 of	 this	 basic	 fact	 of	 consciousness.	 The
lower	half	of	the	wheel	will	refer	to	what	is	below	the	Earth	surface,	the	upper
half	to	what	is	above.	The	horizontal	axis	of	the	chart	is	then	actually	the	horizon
—dividing	 the	 world	 of	 the	 living	 into	 two	 realms—visible	 and	 invisible;	 and,
by	extension,	objective	and	subjective,	exterior	and	interior.

This	horizontal	line	of	the	birth-chart	represents	thus	the	fact	of	a	necessary
division	 of	 consciousness	 into	 two	 realms,	 for	 any	 individual	 living	 on	 the
Earth’s	surface.	But	there	is	something	else	to	take	in	consideration.	Individual
selfhood	and	consciousness	are	dependent	for	their	very	existence	upon	life	and
light.	 It	 is	 true	 that	 the	 universe	 is	 filled	 with	 stars	 whose	 rays	 penetrate	 the
Earth.	 But	 unless	 one	 of	 these	 stars	 had	 become	 a	 focalized	 center	 of	 life	 and
light	 for	 the	 Earth—a	 Sun—there	 could	 be	 no	 individual	 selfhood	 or
consciousness	upon	the	Earth.

Thus	it	should	be	clear	that	while	the	horizon	and	the	horizontal	line	in	the
chart	 are	 expressions	 of	 the	 dualism	 of	 consciousness,	 there	 must	 be	 a	 point
which	will	refer	to	the	fact	of	the	focalization	of	life	and	light	through	the	Sun;
for	 life	 and	 light	 are	 the	 necessary	 sustainment	 of	 consciousness.	 This	 point	 is
obviously	the	noon-point.	If	the	Earth	rotates	around	its	axis	it	is	not	only	(from
the	 anthropocentric	 point	 of	 view)	 so	 that	 every	 day	 man	 can	 be	 aware	 of	 the
whole	of	the	universe;	but	also	so	that	he	may	be	energized,	every	noon,	by	the
direct	 inflow	 of	 solar	 life	 and	 light.	 As	 the	 Earth	 rotates,	 noon	 comes	 to	 every
point	of	the	globe,	which	is	thus	vitalized	and	illumined.

From	 this	 point	 of	 view	 one	 might	 say	 that	 what	 is	 involved	 in	 the	 fact	 of
axial	rotation	is	the	impossibility	for	any	whole	to	have	all	its	parts	energized	at
once	 by	 the	 life-force.	 Therefore	 there	 is	 need	 for	 succession	 or	 time.	 An
illustration	 might	 make	 this	 more	 concrete.	 It	 takes	 time	 for	 the	 blood	 to
circulate	 throughout	 the	 body,	 vitalizing	 all	 physiological	 functions	 and	 their
organs.	 Such	 an	 analogy	 between	 the	 cycle	 of	 blood-circulation	 and	 the	 axial
rotation	of	the	Earth	is	not	to	be	taken	too	literally;	yet	it	has	great	significance.
For	just	as	it	is	by	means	of	the	blood-circulation	that	the	life-force	is	distributed
to	all	parts	of	the	whole	organism,	so	it	is	by	means	of	the	axial	rotation	that	the
life-force	 emanating	 from	 the	 Sun	 (symbol	 of	 the	 “heart”)	 is	 distributed	 every
day	over	the	whole	Earth.

We	shall,	later	on,	grasp	the	full	significance	of	this	word	“distributed,”	but
just	now	we	wish	merely	to	establish	the	basic	meaning	of	the	two	axes	of	the
circle	 of	 houses:	 the	 horizontal,	 representing	 the	 dualism	 of	 consciousness
(subjective	 and	 objective,	 self	 and	 the	 others)—and	 the	 vertical,	 whose	 apex
stands	for	the	noon-point,	the	point	of	solar	sustainment;	also	the	point	where	the
particular	 individual	 finds	 himself	 in	 the	 fullest	 possible	 connection	 with	 the
vitalizing	forces	of	universal	being	symbolized	by	the	Sun.

At	 the	 horizon	 man	 sees	 himself	 as	 a	 purely	 particular	 being;	 but	 as	 he

relates	 himself	 to	 the	 Sun,	 he	 absorbs	 life	 and	 becomes	 a	 partaker	 in	 universal
being.	 The	 horizon	 (and	 especially	 the	 Eastern	 horizon:	 the	 Ascendant	 of	 the
birth-chart)	 defines,	 limits,	 particularizes.	 The	 meridian	 or	 zenith	 (the	 Mid-
Heaven	of	the	birth-chart)	vitalizes,	collectivizes,	universalizes.

This	 leads	 us	 to	 the	 study	 of	 the	 second	 motion	 of	 the	 Earth,	 its	 yearly
revolution	around	the	Sun.	This	motion	is	what	gives	birth	to	what	is	called	the
zodiac.	 As	 every	 cyclic	 motion	 takes	 on	 the	 significance	 of	 the	 center	 around
which	 it	 occurs,	 it	 will	 be	 seen	 that	 the	 zodiac	 has	 the	 same	 fundamental
meaning	 as	 the	 Sun—just	 as	 the	 circle	 of	 houses	 has	 the	 same	 fundamental
meaning	 as	 the	 polar	 axis	 of	 the	 Earth.	 The	 significance	 of	 the	 Sun	 can	 be
formulated	in	different	ways,	according	to	the	level	of	interpretation.	It	is	to	be
based,	however,	on	these	essential	facts:	It	is	the	source	of	life	and	light	for	man;
it	 is	 the	 father-mother	 of	 the	 solar	 system	 as	 a	 whole,	 the	 center	 of	 which	 it
occupies.

On	 the	 first	 ground,	 the	 Sun	 represents	 the	 life-force.	 It	 is	 the	 vitalizing,
integrating	 power	 which	 makes	 man	 whole,	 on	 every	 plane	 of	 being;	 which
fructifies	 everything	 and	 brings	 every	 living	 organism	 to	 a	 point	 of	 creative
fulfillment.	 On	 the	 second	 ground,	 the	 Sun	 represents	 the	 force	 that	 holds	 the
entire	 solar	 system	 together.	 All	 inter-planetary	 relationships	 are	 thus	 made
organic	and	significant	in	terms	of	the	Sun;	just	as,	in	another	way,	the	mutual
relations	between	brothers	and	sisters	are	essentially	significant	in	terms	of	their
common	origin—the	mother	and	father.	We	might	say	also	that	as	the	complex
pattern	of	inter-relationship	linking	all	the	glands	and	organs	of	the	body	is	made
significant	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 blood-stream—so	 the	 complex	 pattern	 of	 planetary
relationships	is	made	significant	in	terms	of	the	circulation	of	the	solar	force,	or
by	reference	to	the	Sun,	center	of	the	system	and	lord	of	gravitation.

The	zodiac	gives	us	therefore	first	of	all	a	picture	of	the	cyclic	unfoldment	of
the	 life-force,	 both	 in	 nature	 and	 in	 man;	 then	 it	 also	 provides	 us	 with	 a
background	 for	 the	 development	 of	 the	 complex	 pattern	 of	 inter-planetary	 or
intra-systemic	relationships.	In	the	first	instance	it	represents	the	ebb	and	flow	of
the	 universal	 life-force	 throughout	 the	 year	 cycle.	 In	 the	 second	 instance	 it
constitutes	 a	 system	 of	 co-ordinates	 which	 enables	 us	 to	 formulate	 at	 every
moment	the	configuration	of	all	the	elements	of	the	solar	system	.	.	.	but	always,
of	course,	from	the	point	of	view	of	the	interpreter,	of	man	on	this	Earth—a	point
the	capital	importance	of	which	will	be	revealed	in	the	next	chapter.

### In	early	times,	as	we	saw	in	our	first	chapter,	the	zodiac	was	simply	a	kind	of

agricultural	calendar	solemnly	drawn	by	Initiate-Priests	by	order	of	the	King	or
Emperor,	charting	the	changes	in	the	season.	The	apparent	movement	of	the	Sun
was	tabulated	by	checking	it	up	on	the	permanent	pattern	of	reference	provided
by	 the	 constellations.	 As	 the	 quality	 and	 intensity	 of	 the	 solar	 rays	 changed
throughout	 the	 year,	 and	 it	 seemed	 that	 these	 changes	 corresponded	 with	 the
successive	 conjunctions	 of	 the	 Sun	 with	 stars	 and	 groups	 of	 stars,	 the
imaginative	astrologers	probably	came	to	believe	that	the	stars	did	something	to
the	Sun	which	made	it	alter	the	quality	and	intensity	of	its	rays.	Thus	when	the
Sun	“entered”	a	constellation	of	the	zodiac,	its	energies	took	on	something	of	the
nature	of	the	constellation.	The	Sun	came	to	be	seen	as	a	lens	through	which	the
mysterious	 power	 of	 constellations	 became	 focalized.	 Twelve	 great	 types	 of
cosmic	 energies	 were	 thus	 described,	 and	 the	 solar	 life-force	 partook	 of	 the
characteristics	of	each	of	these	successively,	month	after	month.

To	the	modern	mind,	however,	it	is	clear	that	the	solar	force	itself	does	not
change	 because	 of	 the	 “influence”	 of	 constellations	 which	 in	 themselves	 are
mere	visual	configurations	linking	stars	whose	distances	and	characteristics	are
often	so	varied	as	to	preclude	any	possibility	of	there	being	a	group-significance
to	 the	 constellation	 as	 such.	 The	 zodiac	 is	 merely	 a	 symbolic	 device	 to	 define
and	 measure	 the	 cyclic	 unfoldment	 of	 the	 life-force	 as	 it	 streams	 from	 Sun	 to
Earth	 throughout	 the	 cycle	 of	 orbital	 revolution.	 What	 it	 helps	 to	 chart	 is	 the
cyclic	modifications	of	the	relation	Sun-to-Earth	(that	is,	particular-to-universal;
individual-to-collective).	 The	 significance	 of	 the	 zodiac	 is	 the	 significance	 of
orbital	motion.	As	already	said,	orbital	motion	in	the	solar	system	represents	that
type	of	motion	which	requires	displacement	of	center;	objective	motion,	motion
which	involves	change	of	relationship	in	space.	It	is	the	motion	of	parts	within
an	organic	whole.	Every	whole	is	composed	of	parts	which	move	in	relation	to
each	other	and,	in	the	most	perfect	systems	(such	as	solar	systems	and	atoms),	in
orbits	around	a	common	center.

Orbital	 motion	 is	 thus	 the	 rhythmical	 motion	 of	 relationship;	 whereas	 axial
rotation	represents	the	cycle	of	self-unfolding.	The	development	of	relationship
requires	displacement	of	center.	But	the	unfolding	of	individual	selfhood	per	se
requires	 a	 process	 of,	 let	 us	 say,	 meditation	 or	 introspection.	 We	 compared,	 a
while	 ago,	 the	 axial	 rotation	 of	 the	 earth	 to	 the	 cycle	 of	 blood-circulation.	 The
circulation	 of	 blood	 does	 not	 involve	 displacement	 in	 space	 of	 the	 human
organism	as	a	whole.	But	all	the	activities	of	a	man	as	he	goes	through	his	life	in
his	home	town	involve	displacement	in	space,	because	they	refer	to	the	working
out	 of	 his	 relations	 to	 his	 fellowmen.	 These	 relationships	 cause	 him	 to	 move

about,	 to	 go	 to	 his	 office,	 his	 club,	 his	 parents’	 home,	 etc.;	 and	 all	 these
displacements	could	be	plotted	out	on	the	more	or	less	permanent	background	of
the	city’s	streets	and	buildings.

Likewise,	the	Earth’s	revolution	around	the	Sun	can	be	said	to	be	motivated
by	the	need	to	work	out	varying	relationships	between	Earth	and	Sun,	and	Earth
and	 other	 planets.	 Such	 a	 revolution	 can	 be	 plotted	 out	 on	 the	 more	 or	 less
permanent	 background	 of	 the	 fixed	 stars,	 mapped	 out	 as	 constellations	 (city-
blocks	and	streets	of	the	universe!).	When	an	astrologer	says	that	the	Sun	is	in
Aries,	 he	 means	 that	 the	 relationship	 Sun-Earth	 can	 be	 located	 in	 reference	 to
certain	 points	 of	 the	 skies.	 This	 location	 gives	 the	 relationship	 more	 or	 less
accurately	known	characteristics;	as,	for	instance,	the	fact	that	two	business	men
meet	 in	 their	 office	 defines	 their	 contact	 in	 terms	 of	 business	 transactions,
whereas	if	the	contact	occurred	in	a	ballroom	it	would	have	another	significance.
Stars	are	thus	points	of	reference	enabling	the	astrologer	to	plot	out	the	curve
of	the	changing	Sun-Earth	relationship,	and	of	all	planetary	relationships.	In	the
case	of	the	Sun-Earth	relationship	the	seasons	might	serve	to	define	the	phases
of	the	relationship;	but	the	position	of	the	Sun	with	regard	to	the	stars	is	a	much
more	 accurate	 way	 of	 determination—provided	 the	 phenomenon	 of	 the
precession	of	the	equinoxes	is	taken	into	account.	This	phenomenon	shows	that
not	 only	 do	 men	 move	 about	 within	 the	 city,	 but	 the	 city	 itself	 alters	 its
topography—for	instance,	a	residential	district	becomes	a	business	center,	slums
give	way	to	mansions,	or	vice	versa.

This	 illustration	 is	 obviously	 far	 from	 perfect;	 yet	 if	 it	 is	 not	 taken	 too
literally	it	brings	out	something	of	the	relative	values	of	the	three	types	of	Earth-
motion	 which	 we	 have	 studied.	 It	 remains,	 however,	 in	 order	 to	 complete	 this
part	of	our	work,	for	us	to	indicate	the	nature	and	significance	of	the	“center”	of
the	gyrating	motion	of	the	Earth’s	axis—the	cause	of	the	“Great	Polar	Cycle,”	or
cycle	of	the	precession	of	the	equinoxes.

All	that	it	will	be	necessary	to	say	is	that	the	Earth’s	axis	gyrates	around	the
ideal	 axis	 of	 the	 Earth:	 the	 line	 of	 the	 poles	 of	 the	 ecliptic—that	 is,	 a
perpendicular	 to	 the	 plane	 of	 the	 Earth’s	 orbit.	 The	 axes	 of	 the	 planets	 are
inclined	on	the	plane	of	their	orbit,	and	they	must	all	gyrate	more	or	less	as	the
Earth’s	 axes	 do.	 When	 we	 deal	 with	 planetary	 axes	 we	 deal	 with	 something
which	is	of	opposite	polarity	to	the	Sun.	The	Sun	is	the	collective	center	of	the
system.	It	relates	all	planets	together.	And	the	Sun’s	power	is	felt	especially	at
the	equator.	The	plane	of	the	equator	is	the	plane	of	the	Sun’s	greatest	action,	the

plane	therefore	along	which	the	integrating	forces	of	the	Sun	penetrate	the	Earth.
It	represents	the	maximum	intensity	of	the	collective	energies	of	life.	In	man	it
refers	to	the	Great	Sympathetic	nerve	system	dominated	by	the	solar	plexus,	the
center	of	racial	instincts,	and	largely	of	the	emotions.

On	the	other	hand,	the	polar	axis	represents	the	most	individual	energies	of
the	 planetary	 life.	 Thus	 equatorial	 plane	 and	 polar	 axis	 symbolize	 opposites.	 It
may	be	that	the	significant	reason	why	the	equatorial	plane	of	the	Earth	does	not
coincide	 with	 the	 plane	 of	 the	 Earth’s	 orbit	 (ecliptic)	 is	 in	 order	 that	 the
collective	power	of	the	Sun	may	not	be	over-focalized	and	over-strong.	But	as	a
result	of	this,	the	polar	axis	is	no	longer	perpendicular	to	the	plane	of	the	orbit,
and	 therefore	 (in	 a	 philosophical	 sense)	 it	 must	 gyrate.	 It	 must	 direct	 itself
successively	to	various	stars;	and	it	may	be	that	by	so	doing	the	individualizing
cosmic	forces	connected	with	the	polar	axis	are	strengthened	and	better	able	to
balance	the	collective	pull	of	the	Sun.*

The	pull	of	the	Sun	is	to	the	Earth	as	the	pull	of	the	blood-consciousness	and
of	the	race-self	to	the	individual	attempting	to	function	as	an	individual.	It	is	like
the	 mother-love	 which	 binds,	 and	 which	 often	 thwarts	 the	 unfoldment	 of	 the
individual	factors	in	the	children.	Thus,	perhaps,	the	Earth	is	orientating	its	axis
of	 individualization	 to	 stars,	 as	 the	 youthful	 individual	 to	 teachers	 beyond	 the
circle	of	his	family	and	home.	Then,	as	there	is	no	longer	the	unique	dominating
pull	of	the	mother,	there	come	in	succession	various	teachers	and	inspirers	who,
each	in	his	turn,	awaken	a	particular	quality	or	phase	of	individual	selfhood.	And
this	may	be	the	meaning,	in	terms	of	the	unfoldment	of	Man-the-Whole,	of	the
“Great	 Polar	 Cycle.”	 The	 polar	 gyration	 does	 not	 involve	 displacement	 of	 the
center	of	the	Earth.	It	is	thus	a	subjective	motion,	but	“subjective”	in	a	planetary
sense.

Before	 leaving	 this	 fascinating	 phase	 of	 astrology,	 we	 wish,	 however,	 to
discuss	briefly	the	problem	of	the	division	of	this	Polar	Cycle.	Here	we	have	a
complete	cycle	of	motion	of	the	Earth’s	axis,	and	the	question	arises:	Shall	we
think	 of	 it	 as	 divided	 into	 twelve	 sections,	 as	 if	 it	 were	 a	 sort	 of	 “polar	 (i.e.,
spiritual	creative)	zodiac?”	In	all	probability	it	ought	not	to	be	so	divided.	More
likely,	it	should	be	divided	into	seven	or	seventy	sections.	The	concrete	reason
for	such	a	segmentation	is	that	there	is	a	natural	division	of	the	path	of	the	poles,
due	 to	 what	 is	 called	 “nutation.”	 Nutation	 is	 a	 small	 and	 periodic	 swinging	 or
vibration	of	the	Earth’s	poles	north	and	south,	as	they	travel	around	the	poles	of
the	ecliptic.	It	is	due	to	the	periodical	changes	of	position	of	the	Moon,	slightly

altering	the	direction	of	the	Moon’s	attraction	upon	the	equatorial	protuberance
of	the	Earth.	These	periodical	changes	correspond	to	those	of	the	Moon’s	nodes,
which	complete	a	cycle	in	an	average	of	18.6	years.	Thus	there	are	close	to	1400
polar	 oscillations	 due	 to	 nutation	 within	 each	 Great	 Polar	 Cycle.	 The	 circle	 of
polar	motion	is	not	a	simple	curve,	but	a	wavy	one.	There	being	on	an	average
close	 to	 1400	 such	 waves,	 this	 fact	 may	 help	 us	 to	 establish	 a	 natural
segmentation	of	the	circle	of	polar	motion.

Fourteen	 is	 twice	 7,	 and	 occultists	 refer	 repeatedly	 to	 7	 Rays	 or	 phases	 of
cosmic	 manifestation;	 also	 to	 7	 Races,	 sub-races,	 family-races—and	 similar
planetary	cycles.	It	seems	logical	to	propose,	then,	a	division	of	the	Great	Polar
Cycle	into	7	periods	(and	perhaps	70	sub-periods)	to	serve	as	a	background	for
such	septenary	cycles,	which	refer	to	the	creative	differentiation	of	planetary	and
generic	types	or	qualities.

We	would	thus	divide	the	Great	Polar	Cycle	into	7	periods	of	close	to	3700
years	each.	Each	of	these	periods	would	cover	200	nutations	and	200	complete
cycles	of	the	Moon’s	nodes.	There	is	also,	however,	another	alternative,	which	is
hinted	at	in	H.	P.	Blavatsky’s	Secret	Doctrine,	and	which	refers	to	the	Kabbala.
In	 The	 Book	 of	 Concealed	 Mysteries	 (Siphra	 Dizenioutha),	 which	 is	 the
foundation	of	the	Kabbala,	we	read	the	following	(section	V):

“31.	The	tree	which	is	mitigated	resideth	within.	In	its	branches	the	birds
(souls	 and	 angels)	 lodge	 and	 build	 their	 nests.	 Beneath	 it	 those	 animals
which	have	power	(human	personalities)	seek	the	shade.

“32.	 This	 is	 the	 tree	 that	 hath	 two	 paths	 for	 the	 same	 end.	 And	 it	 hath
around	seven	columns	(or	palaces),	and	the	four	splendours	whirl	around	it
on	their	four	sides.

“33.	 The	 serpent	 which	 rusheth	 forth	 with	 370	 leaps.	 ‘He	 leapeth	 upon
the	mountains	and	rusheth	swiftly	over	the	hills’	like	as	it	is	written	(in	the
Bible).	 He	 holdeth	 his	 tail	 in	 his	 mouth	 between	 his	 teeth.	 He	 is	 pierced
through	on	each	side.”

### Blavatsky	comments	upon	the	last	stanza	by	saying	that:

“When	 mention	 is	 made	 of	 the	 cosmic	 ‘serpent	 which	 runs	 with	 370
leaps’	it	means	the	cyclic	periods	of	the	great	Tropical	Year	of	25,868	years
divided	 in	 the	 Esoteric	 calculation	 into	 370	 periods	 or	 cycles,	 as	 one	 solar
year	is	divided	in	365	days.”

### The	Secret	Doctrine,	II,	p.	531	(third	edition)

The	 “tree”	 referred	 to	 above	 is	 the	 axis	 of	 the	 earth—at	 least	 according	 to	 one
level	of	interpretation;	its	branches	are	currents	of	planetary	magnetism	which,
we	might	say,	constitutes	as	a	whole	the	“vital	body”	or	“aura”	of	the	planet.	The
“7	columns	or	palaces”	would	refer	to	the	seven	mansions	of	the	Pole,	i.e.,	seven
divisions	of	the	great	polar	cycle	of	gyration.	The	“four	splendours”	might	refer
to	 the	 four	 most	 brilliant	 stars	 on	 the	 cyclic	 path	 (Polaris	 and	 Wega;	 Alpha
Cephei	 and	 Alpha	 Dra-conis).	 The	 North	 Pole	 pointed	 and	 will	 point	 to	 these
stars	 respectively	 about	 2700	 B.C.	 (Alpha	 Draconis),	 2100	 A.D.	 (Polaris),	 7500
A.D.	(Alpha	Cephei),	13,000	A.D.	(Wega).

As	for	the	“serpent,”	it	refers	to	the	great	planetary	life-wave,	the	ascending
and	descending	energy	which	passes	through	the	“planetary	spine,”	the	planetary
“I	am”:	the	earth-axis.	It	might	be	called	the	“planetary	kundalini”	It	is	hard	to
say	 if	 the	 Kabbala	 means	 to	 convey	 the	 idea	 that	 the	 total	 cycle	 of	 the	 polar
motion	(which	would	naturally	control	the	serpentine	kundalini	motion)	is	to	be
divided	into	370	periods	of	about	70	years	each	(as	Blavatsky	suggests),	or	that
each	of	the	7	“columns	or	palaces”	is	to	be	divided	into	370	periods	of	10	years
each.	Various	possibilities	of	division	come	to	mind,	but	somehow	the	numbers	7
(or	70)	and	370	(or	3700)	appear	to	be	the	basic	ones.

### the	 secondary	 movement	 of	 nutation,

The	important	point	remains,	however,	that	the	path	of	the	pole,	because	of
is	 actually	 a	 serpentine	 path
circling	 around	 with	 “its	 tail	 in	 its	 mouth”	 (or	 nearly	 so,	 as	 the
pole	 never	 returns	 exactly	 to	 the	 same	 spot	 of	 the	 celestial	 sphere,	 so	 complex
the	motion	actually	is).	It	would	seem	logical,	then,	to	have	an	exact	number	of
the	smaller	curves	at	least	in	each	great	division	of	the	whole	cycle,	which	would
give,	as	a	result,	either	7	great	eras,	each	divided	into	 370	ten-year	periods;	or
better	still	70	and	700	sub-periods	of	respectively	370	and	37	years	each.	This
division	into	7,	70	and	700	periods	may	be	the	planetary	key	to	the	“mystery	of
the	777	incarnations”	to	which	Blavatsky	refers;	also	Alice	Bailey	in	A	Treatise
on	Cosmic	Fire*

There	remains,	however,	the	great	problem	of	how	to	select	a	beginning	for
the	 Great	 Polar	 Cycle.	 Two	 possibilities	 seem	 particularly	 attractive	 to	 us.	 The
first	is	to	begin	the	cycle	as	the	polar	axis	of	the	Earth	comes	exactly	to	point	to
the	present	Pole	Star,	Polaris	in	the	constellation	Ursa	Minor,	which	should	take
place	between	2000	and	2100	A.D.	The	second	is	to	begin	the	cycle	as	the	polar

axis	points	as	close	as	possible	to	the	great	star	Wega	in	the	constellation	Lyra.

The	first	solution	is	recommended	on	two	grounds:	1)	Polaris	is	probably	the
most	 brilliant	 star	 exactly	 on	 the	 circle	 described	 by	 the	 prolongation	 of	 the
Earth’s	axis;	2)	We	believe	that	ideas	always	come	to	be	accepted	about	the	time
when	 a	 crucial	 point	 in	 the	 working	 out	 of	 that	 to	 which	 the	 idea	 refers	 is
occurring.	In	other	words,	the	imminence	of	an	occurrence	calls	for	an	adequate
interpretation	thereof.

The	 second	 solution	 is	 attractive	 inasmuch	 as	 Wega	 has	 always	 been
considered	 as	 a	 star	 of	 special	 significance,	 and	 may	 possibly	 be	 close	 to	 the
point	to	which	the	solar	system	as	a	whole	is	moving.

The	 significant	 fact,	 however,	 is	 that	 the	 arc	 covered	 by	 the	 North	 Pole’s
motion	between	Wega	and	Polaris	is	about	four	times	51°	43’,	that	is	to	say,	it	is
the	space	between	4	points	of	a	seven-pointed	star—representing	a	time-interval
of	about	14,800	years	(4	X	3700).	We	might	write	down	the	following	dates	and
correspondences,	not	as	a	definitive	computation	but	as	a	suggestion	for	further
study:

### 1.	 Polaris—Pole	Star—23,800	B.C
### 2.	 Cepheus—polar	constellation—20,100	B.C.
### 3.	 Alpha	Cygni—Pole	Star—16,400	B.C.
### 4.	 Wega—Pole	Star—12,700	B.C.
### 5.	 Hercules—polar	constellation—9,000	B.C.
### 6.	 Draco—polar	constellation—5,300	B.C.
### 7.	 Draco—polar	constellation—1,600	 B.C.	then	again	 Polaris—Pole	 Star

## —2,100	A.D.

One	 should	 never	 forget,	 however,	 that	 these	 dates	 are	 at	 the	 most
approximate,	and	that	other	polar	motions	(such	as	the	cycle	of	variations	in	the
inclination	 of	 the	 earth’s	 axis)	 introduce	 rhythmical	 alterations.	 It	 may	 also	 be
that	 after	 a	 couple	 of	 thousand	 years	 of	 scientific	 and	 precise	 observations	 we
may	discover	factors	at	present	unexpected.	If,	for	instance,	an	electron	appears
to	jump	from	orbit	to	orbit	as	it	circles	around	the	atom’s	nucleus,	according	to
the	quantum	law,	why	could	a	planet	not	have	sudden	changes	of	orbit,	sudden
variations	 of	 rhythm—	 which	 might	 obey	 laws	 as	 yet	 undiscovered?	 H.	 P.
Blavatsky	 refers	 to	 that	 in	 one	 of	 her	 letters	 addressed	 to	 Sinnett,	 when	 she
remarks	that	the	lengths	of	the	Patriarchs’	lives	in	the	Bible	were	symbolical	of

the	 lengths	 of	 the	 year	 as	 they	 changed	 over	 vast	 periods	 of	 time.	 The	 Earth,
according	to	this,	would	move	regularly	closer	to	the	Sun,	and	thus	the	length	of
the	 year	 would	 decrease.	 This	 may	 explain	 the	 enormous	 periods	 given	 to	 the
history	of	the	planet	in	Brahminical	records.

However,	the	important	point,	symbolically	and	philosophically,	is	for	us	to
think	of	this	polar	motion	as	the	essential	manifestation	of	the	creative	factor	in
astrology—just	 as	we	 think	 of	 axial	rotation	 as	 an	expression	of	 the	individual
factor,	and	of	orbital	revolution	as	an	expression	of	the	collective	factor.	But	by
the	 term	 “creative”	 we	 refer	 here	 to	 a	 cosmic	 creativeness,	 to	 the	 cyclic
outpouring	of	archetypes	and	primordial	ideas	which	mark	the	beginning	of	all
new	 planetary	 cycles.	 Later	 on	 we	 shall	 see	 that	 there	 is	 another	 astrological
factor	 which	 also	 stands	 for	 the	 “creative”	 but	 in	 a	 more	 personal	 sense.	 This
factor	 is	 the	 “Degree	 of	 the	 zodiac”—the	 product	 of	 a	 combination	 and
integration	of	axial	rotation	(individual)	and	orbital	revolution	(collective).

The	creative	is	always	the	result	of	a	synthesis	and	integration	of	elements.
Thus	 the	 gyration	 of	 the	 Earth-axis	 is	 the	 synthesis	 of	 various	 factors	 which
involve	 on	 one	 hand	 the	 gravitational	 pull	 of	 Sun	 and	 Moon	 upon	 the	 Earth’s
equatorial	belt	(gravitation	being	the	force	responsible	for	orbital	revolution	and
thus	 related	 to	 the	 collective),	 and	 on	 the	 other	 the	 axial	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth.
(Cf.	footnote,	page	147.)

### ______________

*	The	following	is	a	clear	scientific	statement	of	the	causes	of	precession	(and	of	polar	gyration):

“This	 peculiar	 behavior	 of	 the	 earth’s	 equator	 (precession)	 is	 due	 to	 the	 gravitation	 of	 sun	 and	 moon
upon	 the	 bulging	 equatorial	 belt	 or	 zone	 of	 the	 earth,	 combined	 with	 the	 centrifugal	 force	 at	 the	 earth’s
equator.	 As	 equator	 stands	 at	 an	 inclination	 to	 ecliptic,	 this	 attraction	 tends,	 on	 the	 whole,	 to	 pull	 its
protuberant	ring	toward	the	plane	of	the	ecliptic	itself.	But	the	earth’s	turning	on	its	axis	prevents	this,	and
the	resultant	effect	is	a	very	slow	motion	of	precession	at	right	angles	to	the	direction	of	the	attracting	force,
similar	 to	 that	 exemplified	 by	 attaching	 a	 small	 weight	 to	 the	 exterior	 ring	 of	 a	 gyroscope.	 Three	 causes
contribute	to	produce	precession:	if	the	earth	were	a	perfect	sphere,	or	if	its	equator	were	in	the	same	plane
with	its	path	round	the	sun	(and	with	the	lunar	orbit),	or	if	the	earth	had	no	rotation	on	its	axis,	there	would
be	no	precession.”

### A	New	Astronomy	by	David	P.	Todd

*	The	orbit	of	the	earth	is	elliptical.	Thus	the	sun	is	only	one	of	the	two	foci	of	the	ellipse.	One	might
attribute	a	symbolical	meaning	to	the	other	focus,	even	though	no	physical	entity	is	found	there.	But	this
would	be	too	abstract	for	our	present	consideration.

*	The	angle	formed	by	the	plane	of	the	Earth’s	equator	and	the	plane	of	the	ecliptic	is	not	constant.	It
varies	within	about	2	V2	degrees	limits,	and	the	cycle	of	the	variations	appears	to	encompass	approximately
40,000	 years.	 This,	 of	 course,	 means	 also	 a	 change	 in	 the	 inclination	 of	 the	 Earth’s	 axis;	 which	 also
modifies	the	circle	traced	by	the	gyration	of	said	axis.	There	are	still	other	cyclic	motions	of	the	Earth	and
cyclic	changes	in	the	Earth’s	orbit.	The	eccentricity	and	the	position	of	the	lines	of	apsides	of	the	latter	are
susceptible	 of	 cyclic	 variations	 of	 respectively	 about	 250,000	 and	 21,000	 years.	 All	 these	 slow	 motions
refer	to	the	planetary	Being	as	a	whole	and	to	the	progressive	development	of	Man	as	a	life-kingdom.

*	In	a	curious	and	well-known	book,	A	Dweller	on	Two	Planets,	written	supposedly	under	the	dictation
of	an	invisible	entity	called	Phylos,	the	Tibetan	(around	1886),	a	diagram	is	reproduced	(p.	382)	purporting
to	 be	 a	 symbolic	 picture	 in	 the	 “Holy	 Place”	 where	 one	 comes	 face	 to	 face	 with	 the	 living	 Christ	 (the
perfected	I	AM).	This	would	be	symbolically	the	“North	Pole,”	the	“Undying	Land”	of	each	human	being.
The	figure	represents	a	broad	circle	on	which	appear	7	seven-pointed	stars,	while	on	each	side	of	this	circle
are	seen	a	row	of	smaller	stars	describing	a	path	representing	or	at	least	suggesting	the	nutated	path	of	the
North	 Pole.	 Cutting	 the	 circle	 diametrically	 is	 a	 rod	 of	 power	 whose	 inclination	 is	 almost	 exactly	 the
inclination	of	the	pole	on	the	ecliptic.	Four	great	symbols	(an	Eye,	a	Star,	a	Leaf	and	a	Book)	are	seen	inside
of	 the	 circle.	 On	 the	 two	 pages	 of	 the	 open	 book	 10	 key	 words	 are	 given	 (Order,	 Justice,	 Truth,	 Mercy,
Wisdom—Beauty,	 Love,	 Fraternity,	 Power,	 Use).	 The	 whole	 picture	 is	 typically	 Kabbalistic	 and	 most
suggestive.

## A	CLASSIFICATION	OF	ASTROLOGICAL
## VIEWPOINTS

Three	Types	of	Astrology
The	 foregoing	 study	 of	 the	 three	 basic	 types	 of	 planetary	 motion	 and	 of	 their
relative	significances	in	terms	of	astrological	symbolism	will	enable	us	to	bring
order	 into	 a	 confused	 situation	 which	 disturbs	 the	 minds	 of	 most	 students	 of
astrology.	 The	 reason	 for	 this	 confusion	 is	 the	 fact	 that	 astrology	 stands	 at	 a
turning	point;	that	a	generalized	attempt	is	being	made	to	reformulate	it	in	terms
of	values	acceptable	to	the	modern	mind;	and	that	in	such	an	attempt	no	line	of
demarcation	has	been	established	between	normally	conflicting	points	of	view.

Every	phase	of	life	and	every	type	of	knowledge	can	be	approached	from	at
least	 three	 basic	 directions,	 emphasizing	 respectively	 the	 individual,	 the
collective	and	the	creative	attitude-—the	latter	being	again	susceptible	of	at	least
a	twofold	interpretation.	Each	of	these	attitudes,	corresponding	to	definite	human
types	(psychologically	and	physiologically),	stresses	its	own	particular	point	of
view,	and	forgets	about	the	others	or	denies	their	validity.	Especially	as	we	enter
the	realm	of	such	unorthodox	types	of	knowledge	as	astrology	and,	we	might	say
in	 general,	 occultism	 or	 esoteric	 philosophy,	 do	 the	 conflicting	 points	 of	 view
appear	 still	 more	 irreducible,	 because	 there	 is	 less	 common	 experience	 and
common	 evidence	 to	 transform	 ideas	 into	 facts,	 hypotheses	 into	 laws.	 It	 is
therefore	 particularly	 necessary,	 if	 chaos	 is	 to	 be	 avoided,	 to	 have	 recourse	 to
some	 sort	 of	 classification	 of	 points	 of	 view	 which	 will	 leave	 room	 for
everybody	and	somehow	relate	all	individual	or	group	efforts	in	terms	of	an	all-
inclusive	pattern	inherent	in	the	nature	of	the	things	studied.

The	realization	that	astrology	deals	essentially	with	the	motions	of	celestial
bodies	 will	 help	 us	 to	 evolve	 such	 a	 classification.	 If	 we	 recognize	 three	 basic
types	of	planetary	motion,	then	we	may	so	extend	their	respective	significances
as	to	be	able	to	characterize	in	terms	of	such	motions	three	essential	approaches

to	 astrology.	 One	 type	 of	 astrology	 will	 function	 primarily	 in	 terms	 of	 axial
motion,	 and	 stress	 the	 individual	 factor	 in	 a	 man	 (natal	 astrology)	 or	 in	 a
situation	 (horary	 astrology).	 Another	 type	 will	 emphasize	 every	 element
connected	 with	 orbital	 revolution,	 with	 the	 Sun	 and	 the	 ecliptic,	 and	 stress	 the
collective	 factor	 in	 the	 behavior	 of	 man	 and	 in	 the	 influence	 determining	 this
behavior.	 Still	 another	 type	 —very	 little	 developed	 as	 yet—will	 be	 of	 a	 more
occult	character	and	deal	with	vast	planetary	factors,	with	the	cosmic	(spiritual
and	 creative)	 influence	 of	 stars	 and	 Divine	 Hierarchies,—or	 else	 with	 occultly
perceived	 symbols	 revealing	 the	 creative	 significance	 of	 every	 astrological
factor.

Each	 type	 should	 normally	 and	 logically	 evolve	 its	 own	 technique	 of
interpretation,	its	procedure	in	the	application	of	general	principles	to	particular
cases,	its	tables	of	data;	and	it	would	naturally	stress	its	own	basic	factors,	even
to	 the	 point	 of	 practically	 recognizing	 no	 significance	 to	 the	 special	 factors
which	 are	 strictly	 the	 products	 of	 the	 other	 types’	 emphases.	 There	 is	 nothing
absolutely	 wrong	 in	 such	 a	 focalization.	 Nevertheless,	 someone	 ought	 to	 have
enough	philosophical	understanding	and	a	broad	enough	vision	to	grasp	the	total
situation,	 and	 to	 state,	 for	 the	 benefit	 of	 all,	 the	 relative	 significance	 of	 the
diverse	methods,,	techniques,	and	theoretical	emphases	or	exclusions.

We	 cannot	 hope	 to	 achieve	 this	 result	 in	 a	 complete	 and	 fully	 satisfactory
manner,	 any	 more	 than	 we	 could	 in	 our	 distressingly	 brief	 survey	 of	 the
historical	 background	 of	 astrology	 (Chapter	 1)	 produce	 an	 adequate	 picture	 of
the	growth	and	evolution	of	astrology	in	the	past.	At	the	same	time,	we	hope	to
be	 able	 to	 convey	 in	 the	 following	 a	 sketchy,	 yet	 inclusive	 idea	 of	 the	 most
fundamental	 characteristics	 of	 those	 branches	 of	 present-day	 astrology	 which
seem	consistent,	fruitful	and	valid.

## 1.	ASTROLOGY	OF	THE	INDIVIDUAL

This	 includes	 especially	 the	 astrology	 of	 the	 individual	 human	 being	 (natal

astrology)	and	the	astrology	of	the	individual	situation	(horary	astrology).

In	 a	 way,	 this	 is	 the	 most	 inclusive	 type,	 at	 least	 potentially.	 As	 “horary
astrology”	it	can	be	applied	to	any	kind	of	situation,	and	as	“natal	astrology”	it
can	 refer	 to	 the	 “birth”	 of	 any	 entity,	 atomic,	 human	 or	 cosmic.	 But	 more
specifically,	what	we	mean	by	“astrology	of	the	individual”	is	a	type	of	approach
which	stresses	individual	characteristics	and	an	individual	interpretation	thereof.
It	will	stress	values	which	are	related	to	the	axial	motion	of	the	earth.

“Horary	astrology”	is	the	type	of	astrological	practice	in	which	the	astrologer
judges	the	elements	of	a	particular	situation,	their	probable	development	in	the
near	future,	and	thus	is	able	to	advise	his	client	as	to	what	is	the	best	solution	of
any	 problem	 involved	 in	 the	 situation	 at	 hand.	 It	 means	 casting	 a	 chart	 for	 the
time	 the	 situation	 is	 brought	 to	 the	 attention	 of	 the	 astrologer.	 The	 chart	 is
interpreted	 primarily	 from	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the	 “houses”	 (products	 of	 the
axial	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth),	 of	 the	 planetary	 rulership	 thereof,	 and	 mostly
according	 to	 an	 individual	 technique.	 The	 factor	 of	 individual	 interpretation	 is
all-important.	 Horary	 astrology	 depends	 for	 its	 validity	 entirely	 upon	 the
“personal	equation”	of	the	astrologer.	It	is	the	most	strictly	individualistic	type	of
astrology—even	though	it	obeys	rather	rigid	rules	of	interpretation.

“Natal	astrology,”	in	the	strictest	sense	of	the	term,	refers	to	individual	birth-
moments.	It	demands	as	a	prerequisite	absolute	accuracy	in	the	knowledge	of	the
moment	of	the	“first	breath”—	the	moment	when	the	human	being	reaches	the
condition	of	individual	or	at	least	independent	existence.	Such	absolute	accuracy
is	necessary	to	establish	beyond	doubt	the	frame-work	of	the	houses,—the	very
frame-work	of	the	native’s	individual	selfhood	and	unique	destiny.	It	is	true,	of
course,	that	collective	factors,	derived	from	the	position	of	Sun,	planets,	zodiacal
signs,	etc.,	are	used;	but	even	those	are	specifically	related	to	the	development	of
an	individual	situation:	the	native’s	life.	Besides,	natal	astrology	presupposes	to
a	 large	 extent	 a	 knowledge	 of	 the	 collective	 environment	 and	 nature	 of	 the
individual	 studied	 (just	 as	 horary	 astrology	 presupposes	 a	 “question”
establishing	 the	 general	 situation	 under	 consideration).	 For,	 without	 such	 a
knowledge,	the	astrologer	has	no	way	of	telling	whether	the	natal	chart	refers	to
a	man	or	an	animal,	to	a	creature	of	the	slums	or	to	a	highly	cultured	aristocrat.
Therefore	 without	 a	 general	 knowledge	 of	 the	 species,	 race	 and	 class	 of	 the
native,	natal	astrology	can	be	only	very	vague,	and	does	not	fulfill	its	function,
which	is	to	release	and	increase	the	significance	of	an	individual	destiny	and	of
a	unique	personality—thus	enhancing	its	individualness	and	its	uniqueness.

Such	 a	 true	 natal	 astrology	 is	 therefore	 based	 essentially	 on	 psychological
understanding.	 It	 deals	 with	 subjective	 interpretation	 of	 objective	 facts.	 It	 is	 a
system	 of	 creative	 life-interpretation	 and	 creative	 symbolism	 applied	 to	 an
individual	personality.	Theoretically,	it	stresses	factors	derived	from	the	rotation
of	the	earth	around	the	polar	axis,	just	as	it	studies	a	human	being	as	a	complex
of	 attributes	 and	 tendencies	 centered	 more	 or	 less	 adequately	 around	 an
individual	 axis,	 the	 “I	 am”	 or	 ego,	 the	 spine	 and	 cerebro-spinal	 system	 of	 this
human	being.

### It	is	this	type	of	astrology	which	we	shall	especially	study	in	the	remainder

of	this	book.

## 2.	ASTROLOGY	OF	THE	COLLECTIVE

This	 is,	 generally	 speaking,	 “natural”	 or	 “mundane	 astrology,”	 the	 type
which	 was	 associated	 with	 the	 birth	 of	 human	 cultivation	 and	 culture.	 It	 gave
birth	 to	 an	 Agricultural	 Calendar	 based	 on	 a	 study	 of	 the	 modifications	 of	 the
life-force—especially	 of	 the	 influences	 of	 Sun	 and	 Moon.	 It	 later	 became	 the
symbol	 of	 an	 ethical	 and	 spiritual	 Law.	 As	 “natural”	 astrology	 it	 refers	 to
changes	in	seasons,	climate,	weather;	as	 “mundane”	astrology	it	deals	with	the
rise	 and	 fall	 of	 kingdoms	 and	 nations,	 and	 with	 the	 determination	 of	 vast
influences	moulding	the	temper	of	groups	and	collectivities.

Two	points	are	outstanding	in	an	evaluation	of	such	a	type	of	astrology:	1)	It
deals	with	actual	influences,	with	rays	and	magnetic	currents	which	are	said	to
emanate	from	Sun,	stars	and	planets,	and	to	produce	changes	in	all	Earth-beings.
These	changes	are	at	first	physiological,	but	they	react	at	once	on	the	psyche—
mainly	 on	 the	 emotions.	 2)	 Its	 approach	 is	 thus	 essentially	 objective,	 which
makes	 it	 amenable	 to	 “scientific”	 treatment.	 That	 is	 to	 say,	 it	 is	 largely
experimental.	It	develops	by	means	of	statistical	judgments,	and	can	be	checked
up	by	objective	tests	of	a	sort	and	by	measurements.	Its	mode	of	operation	is	not
essentially	 different	 from	 that	 of	 sciences	 dealing	 with	 telluric	 forces,
earthquakes,	weather,	and	all	more	or	less	cyclic	changes	of	conditions	affecting
all	 biological	 species	 on	 Earth.	 It	 deals	 with	 the	 collective	 moods	 of	 men	 and
nations,	 just	 as	 other	 sciences	 deal	 with	 the	 secular	 growth	 of	 trees,	 rocks	 and
continents.	It	deals	with	human	collectivities,	or	human	psychological	changes	in
the	collective.

As	already	mentioned,	the	most	clear-cut	manifestation	of	such	an	astrology
is	seen	in	the	work	of	T.	O.	McGrath,	in	his	studies	of	the	cycles	of	business	in
correspondence	 with	 Sun-spot	 cycles	 (11.2	 years),	 with	 the	 Moon	 nodes	 cycle
(18.6	 years),	 and	 with	 two	 other	 cycles	 of	 40	 months	 and	 of	 56	 years
respectively.	 He	 does	 not	 call	 his	 work	 “astrology,”	 because	 it	 deals	 with	 the
heliocentric	positions	of	the	planets—which	are	seen	much	as	triggers	releasing
solar	 operations,	 and	 because	 in	 general,	 the	 approach	 is	 purely	 satistical	 and
concrete.	 Sun,	 stars	 and	 planets	 are	 huge	 magnets;	 their	 motions	 release
electrical	 forces.	 The	 solar	 system	 as	 a	 whole,	 and	 the	 surroundings	 of	 each
planet	in	particular,	are	seen	as	vast,	magnetic	fields,	interacting	upon	each	other.
The	whole	science	is	that	of	“cosmic	electro-dynamics.”

Edward	 Johndro,	 a	 radio	 engineer,	 was	 perhaps	 the	 first	 to	 develop	 this
approach	to	a	point	of	great	complexity.	He	does	not	entirely	leave	the	field	of
natal	astrology.	But	even	when	dealing	with	individual	nativities,	he	apparently
stresses	almost	exclusively	the	play	of	collective	and	concrete	factors	within	the
individual.	For	instance	the	geographical	location—the	place	of	residence	of	the
person—is	made	to	be	of	paramount	importance:	man	is	seen	almost	completely
as	product	of	an	environment,	as	a	mere	unit	in	a	vast	system	of	planetary	and
celestial	relationships,	a	particular	example	of	the	genus	homo	sapiens.	Another
Kabbalist	and	astrologer,	Paul	Counsil,	is	following	the	same	line	of	approach;
and	a	number	of	other	workers	in	that	field	are	developing	it	steadily.

They	 specialize,	 however,	 in	 mundane	 problems:	 In	 the	 determination	 of
earthquakes,	 the	 “birth-charts”	 of	 cities	 and	 nations,	 and	 all	 matters	 affecting
human	 collectivities.	 They	 are	 usually	 very	 proud	 of	 being	 “scientific”	 or
“mathematical”—	though,	as	a	matter	of	fact,	they	are	not	“mathematical”	in	the
deepest	sense	of	the	term,	but	rather	exponents	of	an	extended	system	of	electro-
dynamics,	which	considers	the	push	and	pull	of	planets	upon	each	other	as	very
real	 and	 concrete,	 even	 if	 stated	 in	 terms	 of	 electrical	 forces	 rather	 than	 as
Newtonian	gravitation.	They	are	dealing	not	with	“symbols”—as	the	most	recent
type	 of	 atomic	 physics	 is	 wont	 to	 do—but	 with	 “vital	 forces”	 emanating	 from
stars	and	Sun.

In	 such	 a	 type	 of	 astrology	 the	 Sun	 occupies	 normally	 a	 most	 strikingly
conspicuous	 position	 as	 the	 source	 of	 the	 life-force	 of	 the	 whole	 system.	 The
approach	is	logically,	in	most	cases,	heliocentric.	What	is	studied	is,	first	of	all,
solar	emanations;	and	the	planets	act	largely	as	reflectors	or	stimulants	to	solar
discharges.	In	the	old	Ptolemaic	astrology	the	Sun	was	seen	as	the	focal	point	of
the	 zodiac,	 a	 band	 of	 the	 skies	 extending	 over	 23	 degrees	 each	 side	 of	 the
ecliptic.	The	zodiac	was	the	realm	of	the	Sun.	Within	its	boundaries	all	planets
appeared	to	move.	Projected	on	the	Earth	globe,	it	was	the	equatorial	belt—also
the	 realm	 of	 the	 Sun.	 Thus	 while	 “astrology	 of	 the	 individual”	 refers	 more
especially	 to	 the	 polar	 axis,	 “astrology	 of	 the	 collective”	 deals	 primarily	 with
equatorial	 forces.	 In	 man	 these	 forces	 are	 those	 acting	 through	 the	 Great
Sympathetic	 system	 and	 mainly	 the	 solar	 plexus	 (and	 other	 centers).	 In	 Hindu
yoga,	 these	 centers	 are	 the	 “lotuses”	 or	 chakras.	 But	 two	 systems	 are	 to	 be
differentiated:	 the	 system	 that	 deals	 with	 these	 “lotuses”	 which	 are	 foci	 of
collective	consciousness	and	being;	and	the	system	that	deals	with	centers	in	the
spine.	A	third	system	of	“centers”	can	also	apparently	be	found	within	the	head
—giving	us	again	our	three	basic	terms:	collective,	individual	and	creative.

In	 the	 new	 type	 of	 “astrology	 of	 the	 collective”	 the	 problem	 is	 more
complex.	 The	 Sun	 is	 even	 more	 the	 focal	 point	 of	 the	 study;	 but	 a	 planetary
zodiac	 and	 a	 solar	 zodiac	 have	 apparently	 to	 be	 used	 in	 order	 to	 make	 matters
logical	 and	 coherent—defining	 respectively	 the	 magnetic	 field	 of	 the	 Earth
enveloping	the	Earth,	and	that	of	the	Sun	encompassing	the	entire	solar	system.
Ptolemaic	 astrology,	 nevertheless,	 still	 dominates	 the	 ordinary	 present	 day
astrology;	and	it	is	obvious	that	it	must	do	so	because	of	practical	considerations
as	 well	 as	 because	 of	 the	 level	 at	 which	 most	 human	 beings	 still	 live—a
physiological,	equatorial	and	collective	level.	First,	for	the	purpose	of	quick	and
professionally	 cheap	 astrological	 interpretation,	 it	 is	 evident	 that	 nothing	 more
than	“Sun-sign	readings”	can	be	offered:	solar-plexus,	emotional-vital,	equatorial
readings	which	deal	with	twelve	basic	types	of	racial	instincts	and	of	collective
focalizations	of	energy.	Then,	very	few	persons	know	their	exact	birth-moment,
which	 makes	 an	 accurate	 reading	 in	 terms	 of	 axial-rotation	 factors	 (Houses,
Ascendant,	Parts,	etc)	impossible.	Thus	the	strictly	individual	factor	remains	in
doubt;	 very	 often	 it	 is	 a	 mere	 potentiality	 and	 can	 be	 seen	 only	 in	 terms	 of
“pattern	 of	 fated	 circumstances.”	 Collective-equatorial	 astrology	 is	 the	 one
befitting	persons	who	live	a	purely	collective	life.

Collective	 life,	 in	 our	 age	 of	 racial	 and	 cultural	 disintegration,	 means
ordinarily	a	chaotic,	hectic	life	driven	at	the	mad	tempo	of	city-behavior.	But	in
ancient	 times	 it	 meant	 harmonious	 earth-growth,	 a	 growth	 not	 unlike	 that	 of
plants	and	trees.	The	great	man	was	the	flower	and	fruition	of	his	tribe	or	race,	a
collective	 expression	 brought	 to	 the	 point	 of	 structural	 perfection.	 He	 was	 a
perfect	 man	 inasmuch	 as	 he	 manifested	 perfectly	 the	 qualities	 of	 his	 racial
collectivity.	As	he	did	that,	he	was	seen	as	the	conscious	focalization	of	a	higher
collectivity—the	collectivity	of	perfected	ancestors	in	one	sense;	a	vast	Celestial
Hierarchy,	 in	 a	 still	 more	 remote	 (yet	 also	 “ancestral”)	 sense.	 Such	 a	 man
became	a	Mediator	between	heaven	and	Earth.	Which	leads	us	to	a	third	type	of
approach	to	astrology.

## 3.	OCCULT	ASTROLOGY

Occult	 astrology	 should	 not	 be	 considered	 entirely	 apart	 from	 the	 two
preceding	types,	any	more	than	one	can	ever	consider	the	creative	apart	from	the
individual	 and	 the	 collective.	 We	 have	 seen	 that	 the	 gyration	 of	 the	 Poles	 is
determined	by	a	combination	of	factors:	mainly,	the	rotation	of	the	planet	around
its	 axis	 and	 the	 gravitational	 pull	 of	 the	 Sun	 (and	 the	 Moon)	 upon	 the	 bulging
equatorial	 belt	 (which	 bulging	 is	 again	 a	 result	 of	 the	 axial	 rotation	 and	 the

centrifugal	forces	it	generates).	Likewise	the	occult	approach	to	astrology—or	to
anything,	 for	 that	 matter!—is	 determined	 by	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 individual’s
approach	 and	 the	 level	 of	 the	 collective	 instincts	 (inherited	 vitality)	 which	 the
individual	focalizes.

In	 archaic	 times	 the	 consciousness	 of	 men	 was	 centered	 essentially	 at	 the
physiological	level.	Intelligence	was	then	organic	instinct	made	conscious,	then
progressively	abstracted	from	particular	conditions	and	endowed	with	universal
significance.	This	process	was	really	what	was	meant	by	Initiation.	As	the	result
of	 Initiation	 man	 was	 able	 to	 project	 his	 conscious	 and	 universalized	 instincts
upon	the	celestial	sphere—the	Body	of	God	(Macrocosm	and	Macroprosopus	in
the	Kabbala).	But	also	he	was	able	to	receive	the	Body	of	God	within	his	own
earthly	 organism.	 In	 other	 words,	 the	 universal	 became	 particular,	 inasmuch	 as
the	 particular	 had	 become	 universal.	 And	 the	 reverse	 was	 also	 believed	 to	 be
true:	Because	the	universal—God	and	the	Celestial	Hierarchies	of	Builders—had
projected	 Itself	 upon	 the	 Earth,	 out	 of	 this	 Earth	 had	 been	 evolved	 a	 creature
made	into	the	likeness	of	the	archetypal	celestial	world	and	of	its	Hierarchies—
into	 the	 very	 likeness	 of	 God;	 a	 microcosm,	 in	 potentiality	 however,	 not	 in
actuality—	 until	 by	 following	 the	 first	 mentioned	 process	 of	 initiation,	 the
potential	“likeness	of	God”	became	energized	by	the	creative	will	of	the	“I	am”
latent	 in	 every	 man,	 and	 appeared	 as	 an	 actual	 spiritual	 fact—the	 so-called
Christ-body.

To	explain	this	double	process	fully	would	require	an	entire	volume,	which
in	fact	would	mean	very	little	until	the	process	itself	had	been	experienced;	but
the	 main	 thing	 to	 grasp	 is	 that	 it	 involves:	 1)	 a	 structural	 focalization	 of	 the
universal	 as	 a	 prototype	 latent	 within	 man’s	 earthly	 body;	 2)	 an	 expansion	 of
consciousness	 from	 the	 particular	 ego-consciousness	 into	 an	 organic	 universal
consciousness.	 These	 two	 processes	 may	 be	 called	 involution	 and	 evolution.
Involution	 means	 here	 the	 building	 by	 the	 Celestial	 Hierarchies	 of	 an	 “astral”
prototype	 within	 the	 earthly	 man	 as	 man’s	 potential	 form	 of	 divinity.	 On	 the
other	 hand,	 evolution	 refers	 to	 the	 expansion	 and	 universalization	 of	 man’s
consciousness,	 through	 the	 efforts	 of	 his	 own	 individual	 “I	 am,”	 until	 this	 “I
am,”	having	assimilated	the	power	of	all	the	divine	“virtues”	or	Rays,	becomes
self-identified	with	and	an	avatar	of	God.

Occult	 astrology	 (when	 properly	 understood!)	 clears	 up	 much	 that	 is
confusing	and	intricate	in	these	two	processes.	The	involutionary	process	refers
to	 the	 equatorial	 realm	 and	 the	 zodiac;	 the	 evolutionary	 process,	 to	 the	 polar
axis	 and	 its	 motions.	 So	 far,	 there	 has	 been	 practically	 no	 direct	 mention

anywhere	of	the	astrological	factors	involved	in	this	occult	evolutionary	process.
All	that	has	been	mentioned	has	been	the	change	of	instinctual	level	of	mankind
coinciding	with	the	entrance	of	the	Sun,	by	the	precession	of	the	equinoxes,	into
zodiacal	 constellations.	 This,	 however,	 is	 only	 one	 half	 of	 the	 story,	 a
consequence	 rather	 than	 a	 cause.	 Again	 let	 us	 repeat	 that	 the	 cause	 of	 the
precession	of	the	equinoxes	is	the	gyration	of	the	polar	axis.

The	zodiac,	in	the	Ptolemaic	system,	is	a	belt	of	creative	fire	surrounding	the
earth,	this	fire	being	focalized	upon	our	planet	by	the	disc	of	the	Sun—the	Sun
being	 a	 mere	 lens	 through	 which	 the	 zodiacal	 Whole	 focalizes	 its	 twelve-fold
energy	 upon	 the	 Earth.	 The	 zodiacal	 Hierarchies	 are	 hierarchies	 of	 Builders
—Cosmocrea-tores	 as	 they	 are	 called.	 They	 constitute	 together	 the	 Cosmic
Formative	 Power	 (Mahat	 in	 Sanskrit).	 In	 music	 they	 are	 symbolized	 by	 the
Cycle	of	12	Fifths,	which	rules	over	the	sequence	of	“tonalities,”	the	cycle	of	12
“lyus”	which	constitute	the	basis	of	Chinese	music.	They	are	the	series	of	Great
Ancestors,	 the	 Patriarchs	 of	 the	 Bible	 and	 of	 Hindu	 cosmogony,	 the	 Twelve
Gates	 of	 the	 “Holy	 City”	 within	 man’s	 “Christ-body,”	 etc.	 They	 refer	 to	 the
Great	Sympathetic	system	and	its	“lotuses”	(two	Hierarchies	for	each	“lotus,”	as
well	as	two	zodiacal	signs	ruled	by	each	planet	—Sun-Moon	being	symbolically
one	 planet).	 Most	 particularly	 do	 they	 refer	 to	 the	 solar	 plexus	 and	 the
diaphragm:	 the	 equatorial	 belt	 within	 which	 “tropical”	 passions,	 above	 (heart)
and	below	(sex),	centralize.	In	and	through	the	zodiac,	earth-substance	becomes
Man.	 But	 along	 the	 path	 of	 the	 polar	 axis,	 the	 “tree”	 of	 the	 “I	 am,”	 Man
polarizes	 himself	 in	 turn	 to	 the	 seven	 great	 Rays	 of	 the	 Logos	 or	 God.	 He
identifies	 himself	 with	 the	 seven	 Rays	 and	 the	 seven	 Avatars	 of	 the	 Cosmic
Christ	 (or	 Vishnu)—and	 becomes	 the	 eight—Krishna,	 the	 Human	 Christ,	 the
Living	God,	Ishvara-in-the-body.

Thus	while	the	zodiacal	Hierarchies	are,	in	cosmic	symbology,	the	Builders
of	 the	 human	 bodies	 or	 vehicles	 (represented	 al-legorically	 in	 the	 Bible	 by	 the
“Tabernacle	in	the	Wilderness”	and	the	“Temple	of	Solomon”),*	the	Stars	of	the
Eternal	Abode	(North	Pole)	symbolize	the	Spiritual	Teachers	and	Avatars	who,
one	 by	 one,	 according	 to	 the	 principle	 of	 the	 Permutation	 of	 Rays,	 arouse	and
energize	Man’s	“I	am.”	It	is	they	who	personify	the	great	occult	energies	of	the
Dragon	of	Wisdom	(the	constellation	Draco)	whose	head	points	to	Wega,	whose
tail	 separates	 the	 Great	 Bear	 from	 the	 Little	 Bear,	 and	 whose	 fore-body	 curves
around	the	pole	of	the	ecliptic—the	Great	Empty.	This	is	the	“Central	Palace”	of
Chinese	cosmogony,	Tien-ki,	whose	color	is	purple.

While	 on	 this	 subject	 of	 Rays,	 which	 esotericists	 have	 so	 badly	 mistreated,
we	 may	 be	 allowed	 to	 quote	 from	 The	 Secret	 Doctrine,	 where	 the	 teaching
apparently	first	appeared	in	its	modern	theosophical	form:

“The	star	under	which	a	human	Entity	is	born,	says	the	Occult	teaching,
will	remain	forever	its	star,	throughout	the	whole	cycle	of	its	incarnations	in
one	Manvantara.	But	this	is	not	his	astrological	star.	The	latter	is	concerned
and	connected	with	the	personality,	 the	former	with	the	INDIVIDUALITY.
The	‘Angel’	of	that	Star,	or	the	Dhyani-Buddha,	will	be	either	the	guiding	or
simply	the	presiding	‘Angel,’	so	to	say,	in	every	new	rebirth	of	the	monad,
which	 is	 part	 of	 his	 own	 essence,	 though	 his	 vehicle,	 man,	 may	 remain
forever	 ignorant	 of	 this	 fact.	 The	 adepts	 have	 each	 their	 Dhyani-Buddha,
their	elder	‘twin	Soul,’	and	they	know	it,	calling	it	‘Father-Sour	and	‘Father-
Fire.’	It	is	only	at	the	last	and	supreme	initiation,	however,	that	they	learn	it
when	placed	face	to	face	with	the	bright	‘Image.’	.	.	.	There	are	seven	chief
groups	of	such	Dhayan	Chohans,	which	groups	will	be	found	and	recognized
in	 every	 religion,	 for	 they	 are	 the	 primeval	 SEVEN	 Rays.	 .	 .	 .	 Hence	 the
seven	chief	planets,	the	spheres	of	the	indwelling	seven	spirits,	under	each	of
which	 is	 born	 one	 of	 the	 (seven)	 human	 groups	 which	 is	 guided	 and
influenced	thereby.”

The	Secret	Doctrine,	Vol.	I,	p.	572.	First	Ed.

The	seven	“Rishis	of	the	Great	Bear”	are	also	often	correlated	with	the	seven
cosmic	 Rays	 and	 the	 seven	 “sacred”	 Planets;	 but	 it	 is	 worth	 noting	 that	 the
constellation	 of	 the	 Great	 Bear	 is	 out-side	of	 the	 circle	 described	 by	 the	 North
Pole.	The	symbology	of	these	constellations	around	and	partly	inside	this	circle
is	in	itself	a	fascinating	subject	for	study.	Of	all,	Draco	is	presumably	the	most
sacred	and	mysterious.	The	body	of	the	Dragon	cuts	the	circle	of	polar	gyration
about	 the	 place	 where	 the	 North	 Pole	 was	 in	 3102	 B.C.—the	 beginning	 of	 the
great	cycle	of	Kali	Yuga,	in	Hindu	cosmogony.	This	is	perhaps	to	be	considered,
if	not	as	the	beginning	of	the	whole	polar	cycle,	at	least	as	that	of	one	of	its	main
divisions.

In	A	Treatise	on	Cosmic	Fire,	written	down	by	Alice	Bailey,	there	is	a	great
deal	 which	 is	 given	 out	 concerning	 the	 occult	 approach	 to	 astrology.	 However,
the	subject	is	not	studied	as	a	whole,	and	only	somewhat	puzzling	hints	are	given
concerning	such	constellations	and	stars	as	the	Great	Bear,	Sirius,	the	Pleiades,
etc.	We	hope	that	the	above	may	shed	some	light	on	a	field	of	symbolism	as	yet

practically	untouched.

One	thing,	however,	must	be	added.	For	the	occultist	these	constellations	and
stars	 are	 not	 apparently	 symbols,	 but	 are	 the	 manifestations	 of	 cosmic	 Beings,
Who	 influence	 our	 planet	 and	 mankind.	 In	 this,	 therefore,	 occult	 astrology	 is
linked	to	mundane	and	vitalistic	astrology—which	deal	with	life-force,	solar	and
cosmic	Rays,	and	the	like.	At	the	same	time,	A	Treatise	on	Cosmic	Fire	is	based
entirely	on	the	Law	of	Correspondences—as	are	all	occult	works,	including	the
Kabbala	 and	 The	 Secret	 Doctrine.	 But	 to	 use	 the	 Law	 of	 Correspondences	 is
another	 way	 of	 using	 symbolism!	 If	 there	 is	 a	 “Correspondence”	 between
macrocosm	 and	 microcosm,	 between	 the	 hair	 of	 man	 and	 the	 hair	 of	 the	 Great
Man	 of	 the	 Heavens	 (as	 in	 the	 Kabbala)—then	 either	 one	 or	 the	 other	 of	 the
“corresponding”	 objects	 can	 be	 considered	 as	 a	 “symbol”	 of	 the	 other;	 or	 both
may	 be	 said	 to	 be	 equally	 symbolic	 of	 a	 purely	 subjective,	 un-formulatable
reality.	Thus	“occult	astrology”	is,	actually	and	especially	for	all	philosophically
inclined	students,	a	system	of	cosmic	symbolism	linking	the	equatorial	and	the
polar	natures	in	Man	to	related	zones	of	the	heavens	around	the	Earth.

Another	 form	 of	 occult	 astrology,	 this	 time	 symbolical	 in	 a	 dramatic	 or
actional	manner,	is	that	which	has	brought	forth	series	of	symbolic	pictures,	one
for	each	degree	of	the	zodiac.	We	shall	discuss	this	phase	of	astrology	at	length
in	a	later	chapter.	Suffice	it	to	say	here	that	it	follows	in	the	footsteps	of	the	Yi
King	and	of	the	whole	of	Chinese	and	Tibetan	esotericism;	and	before	them,	of
what	is	often	spoke	of	as	the	Primeval	Revelation	of	mankind.	We	have	already
considered	this	matter	in	the	chapter	on	the	“Cyclic	Process”	when	speaking	of
Primordial	Images	and	Archetypes.	All	of	these	are	manifestations	of	the	cosmic
Creative—	as	is	occult	astrology.	For	the	whole	Sky	itself	is	but	one	of	the	first
and	most	potent	Primordial	Images.	And	it	can	be	considered	as	the	Creation	of
the	 One	 Individual,	 whom	 some	 call	 the	 Great	 Architect	 of	 the	 Universe,	 and
others	worship	as	God.

### Basic	Elements	in	“Harmonic	Astrology”

After	 having	 discussed	 the	 “logical”	 foundation	 of	 astrological	 symbolism,
and	after	having	isolated	the	three	great	approaches	to	astrological	interpretation,
the	 three	 basic	 types	 of	 astrology,	 we	 shall	 now	 study	 this	 astrological
symbolism	in	relation	to	the	“astrology	of	the	individual.”	More	particularly,	we
shall	show	how	the	universally	accepted	elements	of	astrology—such	as	houses,
zodiacal	 signs	 and	 planets—are	 to	 be	 interpreted	 in	 a	 type	 of	 astrology	 which
emphasizes	psychological	values.	We	have	often	called	such	a	type	of	astrology

Harmonic	 Astrology,	 because	 it	 provides	 a	 basis	 for	 the	 harmonization	 and
integration	of	the	human	psyche.	It	considers	the	birth-chart	as	the	life-chord	of
the	 individual	 being	 and	 destiny	 it	 symbolizes;	 also	 we	 might	 say,	 as	 the	 true
Name	of	this	individual	being.	It	realizes	that	most	human	beings	are	living	only
in	parts	of	themselves,	living	fragmentary,	incomplete	and	sadly	unfulfilled	lives.
The	 wholeness	 that	 they	 essentially	 are,	 as	 complete	 Individuals,	 is	 there—
potential,	archetypal,	but	expressed	or	manifested	only	in	bits.	This	wholeness	is
the	true	Chord	of	their	individual	selfhood;	but	only	a	few	notes	of	the	chord	are
sounding	at	a	time,	some	never	vibrate	at	all,	and	there	is	no	intensity	or	fulness
in	their	whole	life-performance.

To	help	man	fulfill	the	wholeness	of	his	being	and	perform	the	total	score	of
his	Destiny—such	is	the	purpose	of	Harmonic	Astrology.	The	birth-chart	is	the
key	 to	 the	 wholeness	 of	 an	 individual	 and	 of	 his	 outer	 manifestation—his
Destiny.	 It	 is	 the	 score	 of	 the	 symphony	 which	 a	 living	 man	 is.	 It	 is	 the
archetypal	pattern,	the	symbolical	formula,	the	Signature	of	the	whole	being.	It
is	 the	 blue-print	 of	 the	 building	 that	 is	 his	 perfected	 selfhood—and	 it	 also
contains	 the	 time-schedule	 according	 to	 which	 the	 various	 phases	 of	 the
building-operation	will	proceed	in	ordered	sequence—what	we	call	the	Destiny
of	the	man.

Astrology	is	not	merely	the	study	of	an	interesting	system	of	symbolism;	nor
is	it	essentially	fortune-telling	to	satisfy	personal	curiosity.	It	is	a	practical	study
with	a	very	definite—even	if	usually	not	understood—purpose.	A	vital	purpose.
It	is,	at	least	potentially,	the	foundation	of	a	new	technique	of	living,	of	a	new
principle	of	conduct	(or,	we	might	say,	a	new	yoga)—	implied	already	more	or
less	in	the	technique	of	analytical	psychology	(Jung’s	technique)	and	hinted	at	in
a	 previous	 chapter	 when	 we	 studied	 the	 dualism	 of	 ideals	 characterized	 by	 the
terms	ethical	and	esthetical.

As	 we	 then	 take	 such	 an	 attitude	 toward	 astrology	 we	 have	 to	 confine
ourselves	largely	to	the	realm	of	psychological	values.	It	is	true	that	we	cannot
really	separate	the	psyche	from	the	body.	Physiology	and	psychology	are	closely
interrelated.	The	ancients	knew	this	fact,	but	worked	out	the	correlation	in	terms
of	subtler	bodies	(vital	and	astral,	mostly).	Modern	science	is	tending	to	accept
the	 idea	 of	 “magnetic	 field”	 and	 “electrical	 emanations”	 which—when	 fully
worked	 out—will	 probably	 fulfill	 exactly	 the	 same	 function—a	 function	 of
correlation—as	that	which	gave	value	to	the	archaic	or	“occult”	concepts.

At	 present,	 however,	 and	 considering	 the	 practical	 difficulty	 there	 is	 in

applying	astrology	to	physiology	and	medicine,	it	seems	much	wiser	to	focalize
astrological	 interpretation	 at	 the	 psychological	 level,	 merely	 indicating	 the
possibility	of	physical-organic	correlations	when	such	seem	particularly	obvious
and	of	paramount	influence	upon	psychological	development.

We	 therefore	 face	 the	 human	 being	 through	 his	 birth-chart	 mostly	 as	 a
psychological	 entity.	 He	 is	 a	 particular,	 unique	 being.	 There	 is	 no	 other	 being
exactly	 like	 him.	 Yet	 we	 realize	 also	 that	 this	 unique	 being	 is	 a	 compound	 of
elements	which	are	found	not	only	in	him,	but	in	a	multitude	of	other	beings—
especially	 those	 constituting	 collectively	 his	 space-time	 environment—that	 is,
his	 surroundings	 and	 his	 ancestors.	 This	 unique	 being	 is	 a	 particular	 chord,	 or
combination,	 of	 collective	 elements.	 What	 is	 individual	 therefore	 is	 the
structural	framework	within	which	the	collective	elements	are	organized	more	or
less	adequately.	It	is	the	form	of	the	self.	The	substance,	on	the	other	hand,	is	of
a	collective	nature.	The	body	of	man	is	made	up	of	molecules	which	are	parts	of
the	 vast	 storehouse	 of	 this	 Earth.	 The	 psyche	 of	 man	 likewise	 can	 be	 seen	 as
composed	of	psychic	elements—may	we	call	them	psychons?—which	are	parts
of	the	vast	reservoir	formed	by	the	collective	unconscious	of	mankind	as	a	whole
or	of	definite	groups	within	mankind	(races,	tribes,	nations,	families,	churches,
etc.).

We	 saw	 in	 the	 last	 chapter	 that	 the	 houses	 of	 the	 birth-chart,	 and	 all	 the
elements	originating	from	the	axial	rotation	of	the	Earth,	refer	to	the	individual
factor	in	man—to	the	structure	of	his	individual	selfhood.	On	the	other	hand	the
signs	of	the	zodiac,	and	all	the	elements	originating	from	the	orbital	revolution	of
the	Earth,	refer	to	the	collective	factor,	the	substance	of	his	being.	We	shall	now
add	that	the	planets	refer	to	the	energies	which	are	generated	by	the	constantly
changing	relation	of	collective	to	individual	factors.

The	zodiac	is	the	realm	of	the	Sun	and	of	its	planets.	It	is	the	general	symbol
of	 life-relationships,	 which	 can	 be	 expressed	 as	 gravitation.	 Gravitation	 is	 the
symbol	 of	 relationship,	 of	 attractions	 and	 repulsions	 between	 members	 of	 a
group.	It	is	a	factor	which	belongs	symbolically	to	the	category	of	“equatorial.”
For,	as	we	already	saw,	the	terms	equatorial,	orbital,	solar	refer	to	the	same	basic
factor:	 the	 collective.	 The	 zodiac	 is	 thus	 truly	 a	 background	 for	 and	 an
expression	of	the	various	orbital	motions	of	the	planets.	It	is	a	convenient	way	of
patterning	 and	 recording	 the	 complex	 inter-relationships	 between	 planet	 and
Sun,	and	planets	and	planets.

Planets	 are	 thus,	 in	 terms	 of	 their	 zodiacal	 positions,	 focal	 points	 for

collective	 energies.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 they	 represent	 in	 terms	 of	 their	 house
positions	 (that	 is,	 by	 reference	 to	 the	 horizon	 and	 the	 meridian)	 centers	 of
activities	within	the	individual	structure	of	the	entire	being	(and	destiny).	Thus,
as	 they	 can	 be	 interpreted	 according	 to	 two	 basic	 sets	 of	 reference	 (signs	 and
houses)	 they	 represent	 the	 centers	 of	 forces	 and	 of	 activity,	 whose	 character,
intensity	 and	 mode	 of	 operation	 are	 determined	 by	 the	 constantly	 changing
balance	of	collective	to	individual:	i.e.,	the	personality.

For	 instance,	 Jupiter	 in	 Aries	 refers	 to	 a	 certain	 type	 of	 energization	 and
activation	of	the	type	of	organic	substance	and	organic	function	represented	by
the	 zodiacal	 sign	 Aries.	 Jupiter	 in	 the	 seventh	 house	 refers	 to	 the	 fact	 that
whatever	in	the	consciousness	and	in	the	destiny	of	the	individual	is	symbolized
by	 the	 seventh	 house	 will	 be	 affected	 by	 a	 Jupiterian	 type	 of	 activity.	 As	 the
seventh	house	refers	to	relationships	and	sensations,	these	will	operate	according
to	 an	 expansive	 Jupiterian	 rhythm;	 and	 the	 native	 will	 have	 associates	 and
partners	who	will	expand	his	viewpoint	and	his	sphere	of	action.

What	we	call	today	“personality”	is	a	synthesis	of	patterns	of	behavior.	It	is
the	sum	total	of	all	the	outer	motions	and	emotions	of	the	human	being:	The	total
rhythm	 of	 his	 life-operations—from	 the	 way	 he	 walks	 and	 twitches	 his	 lips,	 to
his	 behavior	 on	 the	 battlefield	 or	 on	 a	 concert	 platform.	 It	 is	 a	 complex	 of
activities.	 Without	 activity	 there	 could	 be	 no	 “personality.”	 And	 personality
behavior	 is	 obviously	 a	 blend	 of	 inherited	 and	 environmental	 influences
operating	 within	 an	 abstract	 structure	 of	 selfhood—the	 individual	 factor.
Likewise,	 the	 planets	 are	 characterized	 as	 to	 their	 nature	 by	 their	 zodiacal
positions,	and	they	operate	in	particular	ways	according	to	their	positions	in	the
structure	of	the	houses.	The	sum	total	of	the	planets	including	the	Sun	and	Moon
—the	 planetary	 pattern,	 as	 we	 call	 it—represents	 thus	 the	 personality	 as	 a
whole.

The	reader	will	probably	infer	from	the	preceding	that	the	planetary	pattern
stands	 therefore	 for	 our	 third	 basic	 term:	 the	 creative.	 It	 does,	 but	 only
potentially.	 It	 represents	 activity,	 first	 of	 all.	 But	 activity	 need	 not	 have	 the
significance	 of	 creativeness.	 Everybody	 is	 active,	 but	 how	 many	 are	 creative?
Creativeness	 is	 the	 significant	 activity	 of	 a	 relatively	 individuated	 personality.
The	 element	 of	 significance	 is	 there	 to	 be	 emphasized;	 and,	 as	 we	 shall	 see
presently,	this	element	is	to	be	revealed	by	the	symbols	of	the	degrees	which	are
energized	 and	 brought	 out	 by	 the	 activity	 of	 the	 planets	 located	 thereon.	 The
planet,	 however,	 need	 not,	 and	 very	 often	 does	 not,	 bring	 out	 the	 symbolic
significance	of	the	degree,	in	which	case	the	type	of	activity	represented	by	the

planet	is	not	creative.	The	human	personality	has	not	reached	the	point	of	even
relative	individuation,	and	the	individual	has	not	yet	the	power	to	give	to	his	life
and	destiny	a	creative	significance.*

## SECOND	SECTION

## THE	DIAL	OF	HOUSES

At	 the	 beginning	 it	 may	 be	 well	 to	 try	 to	 clear	 up	 a	 point	 which	 has	 puzzled
students	of	astrology.	If	we	look	at	an	ordinary	birth-chart,	at	its	simplest	stage
(p.	 187),	 we	 find	 a	 wheel	 divided	 by	 twelve	 spokes	 into	 twelve	 geometrically
equal	 sections	 of	 30	 degrees	 of	 arc.	 Then	 we	 see	 that,	 on	 the	 circumference,
where	 the	 spokes	 end,	 signs	 and	 degrees	 of	 the	 zodiac	 are	 written—giving	 the
longitude	of	these	spokes—i.e.,	their	ecliptical	or	zodiacal	position.	The	question
is	then:	What	is	to	be	considered	exactly	as	a	house?

We	said	that	the	houses	referred	to	the	individual	factor—and	yet	every	chart
has	 these	 same	 twelve	 angular	 divisions,	 the	 same	 obvious	 frame-work.	 The
astrologer	 may	 consider	 the	 question	 as	 one	 of	 little	 meaning;	 but	 it	 has	 a
philosophical	 aspect	 which	 deepens	 the	 significance	 of	 the	 term:	 “individual.”
Briefly	 stated,	 all	 human	 beings	 are	 as	 variations	 upon	 one	 theme,	 MAN.	 The
generic	 structure	 of	 all	 human	 individuals	 is	 fundamentally	 the	 same.	 This	 is
what	is	implied	in	the	fact	that,	although	the	structure	of	houses	is	the	symbol	of
individual	selfhood,	this	structure	is	geometrically	the	same	for	all	individuals.
What	 brings	 a	 relative	 uniqueness	 to	 an	 individual	 is	 the	 way	 this	 twelve-fold
framework	 is	 correlated	 to	 the	 zodiac.	 And	 this	 correlation	 is	 indicated	 by	 the
degrees	and	signs	of	the	zodiac	written	at	the	beginning	(or	cusp)	of	each	house.
The	 inclination	 of	 the	 Earth-axis	 on	 the	 plane	 of	 the	 Earth’s	 orbit	 introduces
greater	variations	according	to	the	latitude	of	the	birth-place.	As	a	result,	usually
more	or	less	than	30	degrees	of	the	zodiac	are	inscribed	within	each	house.

Even	so,	there	are	obviously	a	limited	number	of	possibilities,	and	therefore
every	 individual	 is	 not	 unique	 in	 his	 so-called	 individual	 house-characteristics.
This	again	refers	to	the	fact	that	there	are	a	limited	number	of	individual	pattern-
types.	 But	 the	 point	 is	 that	 every	 pattern-type	 operates	 as	 an	 individualizing
factor.	When	we	speak	of	“individual”	we	do	not	mean	the	“absolutely	unique”;
we	 refer	 to	 that	 which	 assumes	 the	 position	 and	 significance	 of	 uniqueness.

There	 might	 conceivably	 be	 another	 entity	 exactly	 alike;	 but	 in	 the	 houses	 we
shall	still	see	that	which,	in	each	of	these	identical	“uniques,”	forces	upon	them
the	 consciousness	 and	 inner	 realization	 of	 their	 own,	 to	 them,	 unique	 “I	 am.”
And	this	is	what	matters,	psychologically.

### The	Significance	of	the	Twelve	Houses

Considering	now	the	twelve-fold	structure	of	the	houses,	we	shall	recall	what
was	written	in	the	last	chapter	as	to	the	significance	of	the	horizontal	and	vertical
axes	of	the	birth-chart—horizon	and	meridian.	What	is	below	the	horizontal	axis
is	made	invisible	by	the	Earth.	Whatever	there	is	below	the	Earth	must	reach	us
through	the	Earth.	It	is	the	interior	subjective	realm.	What	is	above,	reaches	us
through	 the	 air.	 It	 is	 the	 outer,	 objective	 realm.	 If	 emanations	 there	 be,	 in	 the
former	case	they	reach	us	through	the	feet;	in	the	latter,	largely	through	the	head
(an	occultly	important	fact).	This	explains	why	the	zodiacal	sign	symbolizing	the
head,	Aries,	deals	with	the	beginning	of	objectivity;	whereas	Pisces,	symbolizing
the	feet,	refers	to	subjective	interior	consciousness.

One	can	understand	the	genesis	of	the	meanings	of	the	houses	in	two	ways.
In	 the	 first,	 the	 whole	 wheel	 is	 considered	 as	 a	 static	 structure	 operating	 all	 at
once.	 The	 two	 axes	 mentioned	 above	 represent	 the	 structure	 of	 space,	 of	 the
particular	space	of	the	newborn	entity.	They	form	his	cross	of	incarnation.	He	is
universal	 Life	 quartered	 in	 Space	 and	 thus	 taking	 form	 as	 a	 particular	 being.
Within	 and	 through	 this	 frame-work	 collective	 human	 nature	 operates	 in	 a
particular	 way	 which	 characterizes	 man	 as	 an	 individual	 being.	 The	 two	 axes
divide	 the	 chart	 into	 four	 quarters,	 traditionally	 called	 East-North,	 North-West,
West-South,	 South-East	 quarters.	 These	 work	 out	 respectively	 the	 meaning	 of
the	Ascendant,	the	Imum	Coeli	(Nadir),	Descendant	and	Mid-Heaven;	because	in
astrology	every	division	of	space	or	time	carries	the	significance	of	its	point	of
origin.	So	the	East-North	quarter	(first	three	houses)	carries	out	the	significance
of	 the	 Ascendant,	 the	 South-East	 quarter	 that	 of	 the	 Mid-Heaven,	 etc.	 Each
quarter	 is	 divided	 into	 three	 secondary	 “houses,”	 for	 each	 operation	 of	 life	 is
basically	 threefold,	 including	 action,	 reaction,	 and	 the	 result	 of	 both	 (either
consciousness	 or	 disintegration)—also,	 self,	 not-self	 and	 the	 relation-between.
The	 cross	 of	 particular	 selfhood	 for	 man	 generates	 four	 basic	 modes	 of	 being,
four	fundamental	operations	in	the	process	of	living	as	an	individual.	These	can
be	described	(using	C.	G.	Jung’s	nomenclature)	as:	Intuition,	Feeling,	Sensation,
Thinking.

### But	one	should	more	logically	consider	the	houses	as	the	dial	of	a	watch,	a

mere	projection	in	space	of	a	set	of	pointers	(or	numerals)	recording	a	periodical
motion	 which	 occurs	 really	 in	 time.	 In	 this	 case	 we	 must	 imagine	 the	 line	 of
horizon	moving	counterclockwise,	as	the	hand	of	a	clock.	The	cusps	of	the	first
and	seventh	houses	represent	the	position	of	the	horizon	as	it	actually	is	at	 the
time	 of	 the	 first	 breath.	 The	 line	 of	 the	 cusps	 of	 the	 second	 and	 eighth	 houses
represents	the	position	of	the	horizon	two	hours	afterward;	the	line	of	the	cusps
of	the	 third	and	ninth	houses,	 the	position	of	the	horizon	four	hours	afterward.
Each	house	represents	a	two-hour	interval.	The	house-cusps	give	the	successive
positions	of	the	Ascendant	(the	Eastern	half	of	the	horizon)	every	two	hours;	just
as	one	can	see	from	the	figures	on	a	watch	the	points	to	which	the	small	hand
will	 point	 successively	 during	 a	 12-hour	 period.	 The	 astrological	 “dial	 of
houses”	is	a	24-hour	dial	with	only	one	hand.

We	 shall	 see	 the	 significance	 of	 this	 conception	 presently	 as	 we	 come	 to
study	the	28-year	cycle	of	unfoldment	of	the	individual	self.	For	the	time	being,
it	will	be	simpler	to	consider	the	houses	as	a	segmentation	of	the	space	around
the	 new-born	 child	 into	 twelve	 sections	 of	 30	 degrees	 generated	 by	 two
fundamental	axes,	horizon	and	meridian.	The	emphasis	in	this	case	must	be	put
upon	these	two	axes.	The	cusps	of	the	intermediary	houses	may	be	calculated	in
several	 ways,	 but	 with	 horizon	 and	 meridian	 we	 have	 two	 basic	 factors	 of
individual	 being	 from	 which	 every	 other	 secondary	 element	 derives.	 The	 two
axes	 represent	 then	 what	 can	 be	 named	 the	 space-quadrature—the	 cross	 of
individual	existence.

The	horizon	is	the	line	of	awareness.	It	is	so	according	to	the	most	obvious
logic	 of	symbolical	significance;	for	it	differentiates	 the	two	most	fundamental
types	of	awareness.	Above	the	horizon	is	everything	that	can	be	perceived	by	the
senses;	 below	 the	 horizon	 is	 the	 realm	 of	 this	 interior	 awareness,	 which	 Jung
rightly	calls	“intuition.”	Intuition	is	the	faculty	of	awareness	through	which	we
perceive	 inner	 facts.	 Sensation	 is	 awareness	 of	 the	 not-self,	 of	 others.	 As	 the
Ascendant	is	the	seed-point	of	the	lower	hemisphere,	it	takes	on	necessarily	the
meaning	 of	 pure	 self-awareness;	 the	 Descendant,	 being	 the	 seed-point	 of	 the
upper	 hemisphere,	 is	 the	 symbol	 of	 awareness	 of	 others.	 Thus	 intuition	 and
sensation	are	seen	as	two	complementary	factors,	related	respectively	to	East	and
West.

One	becomes	aware	of	one’s	own	existence	as	an	“I”	by	an	interior	process
which	is	intuition,	whereas	sensation	is	the	result	of	an	awareness	of	outer	causes
attributed	to	sense-impressions.	A	true	sensation	is	not	a	mere	impression,	but	is
rather	the	result	of	the	combination	of	a	sense-impression	and	of	our	particular

sense	of	self.	A	photographic	plate	receives	impressions	similar	to	those	received
by	 our	 retina;	 but	 the	 visual	 sensations	 which	 correspond	 to	 these	 impressions
contain,	 besides	 the	 latter,	 our	 own	 particular	 capacity	 to	 react	 to	 stimuli.	 All
sensations	 involve,	 therefore,	 a	 relationship	 between	 object	 and	 subject.	 Thus
sensation	 is	 truly	 ascribable	 to	 the	 Descendant,	 which,	 traditionally,	 rules	 over
matters	of	relationship,	partnership,	marriage,	etc.

Through	intuition	we	become	aware	of	that	which	we	essentially	are.	On	the
basis	 of	 that	 awareness—”I	 am	 this	 and	 this”—we	 begin	 to	 pass	 immediate
judgments	on	those	changes	which	we	experience	within	our	psyche.	We	feel	for
or	 against	 these	 changes—spontaneously,	 instinctively.	 Thus	 a	 new	 mode	 of
operation	arises:	feeling.	Likewise	from	sensations	and	their	correlations	is	born
a	new	process:	thinking.	Thought	is	the	result	of	sensation,	just	as	feeling	is	the
result	of	intuition.	What	was	abstract	as	intuitive	awareness	becomes	concrete	as
feeling.	 What	 was	 vague,	 fugitive,	 impermanent	 as	 sensation,	 becomes
established,	 relatively	 permanent	 as	 thought.	 More	 than	 this,	 what	 was	 a	 mere
matter	 of	 awareness	 becomes	 an	 actual	 concrete	 experience,	 having	 form	 and
purpose—thus	 significance.	 Feeling
involves	 experience,	 and	 experience
manifests	 either	 as	 feeling	 (if	 the	 basis	 of	 it	 is	 subjective)	 or	 as	 thought	 (if	 the
basis	of	it	is	objective).	To	experience	is	not	merely	to	receive	an	impression	or
be	aware	of	something.	It	is	to	go	out	into	the	thing	(or	the	self)	and	establish	the
significance	thereof,	through	feeling	or	through	thinking.

Thus	we	grasp	the	significance	of	the	vertical	axis,	which	refers	to	concrete
experience.	 Horizontal	 awareness	 becomes	 focalized	 at	 the	 vertical	 points	 as
concrete	 experience.	 The	 receptive	 becomes	 the	 active,	 as	 horizon	 becomes
meridian.	The	 horizontal	axis	referring	to	awareness	is,	 to	use	Jung’s	term,	the
irrational	axis;	whereas	the	vertical	axis	relates	to	the	rational	operations	of	the
self.	Awareness,	whether	of	self	or	of	others,	involves	no	rationalization.	It	is	a
direct	fact	of	life.	An	impression	is	not	rational	of	itself.	It	just	is.	Then	we	begin
rationalizing	it.	If	it	is	an	inner	experience	we	pass	immediate	judgment	upon	it
at	first	by	feeling.	Feeling	is	not	rational	in	the	same	way	as	thinking	is;	yet	both
have	 a	 value	 as	 judgments,	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 which	 we	 act	 subsequently	 as
bestowers	 of	 significance.	 Thus	 we	 may	 call	 them	 rational	 because	 of	 the
particular	 operation	 in	 consciousness	 which	 they	 involve.	 We	 must	 emphasize,
however,	the	fact	that	these	terms	are	used	according	to	their	strict	psychological
sense,	and	not	as	commonly	used	in	everyday	language.

If,	then,	we	wish	to	interpret	psychologically	a	birth-chart	in	which	we	find
Scorpio	ascending,	Taurus	descending,	Leo	in	the	Mid-Heaven	and	Aquarius	at

the	 Imum	 Coeli,	 we	 shall	 begin	 drawing	 our	 conclusions	 as	 follows:	 The
intuition	operates	on	a	Scorpio	basis.	The	native	will	“find	himself”	naturally,	by
using	 methods
the	 characteristics	 of	 Scorpio.	 These	 Scorpio
characteristics	will	provide	him	with	the	best,	because	to	him	most	natural,	path
toward	a	full	awareness	of	what	he	essentially	is.	Through	sex,	through	the	use
and	control	of	life-energies,	through	a	steady	release	of	power,	he	will	reach	full
self-awareness.	The	same	type	of	reasoning	would	apply	to	the	four	angles.

### integration—and

The	 goal	 of	 Harmonic	 Astrology	 is	 to	 lead	 men	 to	 the	 fulfillment	 of	 their
thus
whole	 nature	 and	 being;	 fulfillment,	 correlation,
sublimation.	 What	 is	 necessary,	 then,	 is	 to	 enable	 the	 person	 whose	 chart	 is
analyzed	to	do	the	things	which,	if	his	instinct	had	not	been	frustrated	by	family
and	society,	he	would	have	done	 in	pure	spontaneity.	 The	 sign	(and	degree)	of
the	zodiac	at	the	four	angles	indicate	thus	the	natural	path	toward	the	fulfillment
of	 the	 activity	 symbolized,	 the	 best	 way	 to	 function	 intuitively	 or	 through
feelings	or	thoughts	as	the	case	may	be.	It	represents	what	essentially	is—but	in
many	 cases	 what	 has	 been	 obliterated	 by	 social	 and	 intellectual	 living;	 thus	 it
indicates	 how	 to	 go,	 underneath	 the	 superficial	 and	 acquired	 characteristics,	 to
the	basic	qualities	which	are	really	our	own.

The	 signs	 of	 the	 zodiac	 provide	 us	 with	 a	 set	 of	 twelve	 characteristic	 life-
substances,	or	qualities	of	being,	or	attitudes	to	life,	as	we	may	wish	to	consider
them.	 Where	 they	 appear	 in	 the	 framework	 of	 the	 selfhood	 of	 any	 particular
person	shows	the	qualities	which	are	to	be	attributed	congenitally	to	the	various
faculties	and	modes	of	activities	of	the	person.	They	indicate,	to	use	an	Oriental
term,	the	dharma	of	this	person.	The	dharma	of	the	fire	is	to	burn,	of	the	tiger	to
be	ferocious,	of	a	man	born	with	an	artistic	nature	it	is	to	create,	etc.	Reading	the
angles	of	a	chart	is	thus	to	read	the	total	dharma	of	the	native.

This	will	be	supplemented	by	an	interpretation	of	the	signs	on	the	cusps	of
the	other	houses.	The	“succedent”	houses	(second,	fifth,	eighth,	eleventh)	signify
the	 reaction	 to	 the	 action	 expressed	 in	 the	 “angular”	 houses	 (first,	 fourth,
seventh,	tenth).	This	can	refer	to	either	a	positive	or	a	negative	reaction.	If	the
reaction	 is	 positive,	 what	 is	 signified	 in	 the	 “angular”	 house	 becomes
consolidated	 and	 focalized	 by	 means	 of	 limitations	 and	 contrasts.	 If	 the	 first
house	 means	 awareness	 of	 self,	 this	 awareness	 becomes	 consolidated	 by	 the
limitations	imposed	upon	it	by	past	inheritance	(physiological	and	psychical);	or
at	a	later	stage,	by	possessions	of	all	sorts.	But	if	the	reaction	is	negative,	then
this	inheritance	or	these	possessions	stifle	the	awareness	of	self,	weigh	upon	the
intuition	of	the	“spiritual”	I	with	all	the	inertia	of	materialism.

Likewise,	the	fifth	house	may	either	consolidate	the	experiences	and	feelings
represented	by	the	fourth	house,	as	for	instance	home	(fourth	house);	or	else,	its
contents	 may	 mean	 the	 loss	 of	 the	 fourth	 house	 matters,	 as	 pleasure	 and
speculation	 may	 lead	 to	 the	 loss	 of	 the	 home.	 Too	 much	 pleasure	 and	 foolish
self-assertion	 dulls	 the	 feelings;	 but	 teaching	 and	 art-expression	 enhance	 and
focalize	these	feelings	by	forcing	them	to	face	and	to	give	form	to	the	materials
involved	(children	or	esthetic	materials—fifth	house).	The	same	line	of	thought
applies	 to	 the	 interpretation	 of	 the	 eighth	 house	 (consolidation	 or	 loss	 of	 the
power	 of	 relationship)	 and	 the	 eleventh	 house	 (consolidation	 or	 loss	 of
professional	 and	 public	 life;	 friends	 or	 chimerical	 hopes	 which	 take	 one	 away
from	reality).

With	the	“cadent”	houses	we	face	either	the	result	of	the	loss	implied	in	the
succedent	houses	or	the	workings	and	expression	of	the	psychological	mode	of
operation	(angular)	after	it	has	been	focalized	(succedent).	Thus	the	third	house
symbolizes	 matters	 dealing	 with	 the	 workings	 out	 of	 an	 integrated	 psycho-
physiological	 inheritance.	 The	 substance	 of	 our	 body	 becomes	 really	 our	 own
through	 the	 nervous	 system	 relating	 the	 abstract	 self	 to	 the	 racially	 inherited
cells.	 These	 atavistic	 influences	 of	 the	 second	 house	 manifest	 in	 the	 third	 as
brothers	 and	 sisters,	 or	 rather	 as	 our	 mode	 of	 relation	 to	 them.	 Every	 possible
type	 of	 intimate	 connections	 (in	 one’s	 own	 body,	 or	 one’s	 family	 circle,	 or	 the
area	reached	by	small	journeys)	is	here	characterized.	On	the	other	hand,	if	the
second	 house	 meant	 the	 loss	 of	 self	 in	 one’s	 atavistic	 nature	 (or	 in	 acquired
possessions,	 in	 the	 latter	 cycles	 of	 life),	 then	 the	 third	 means	 neuroses,	 family
jealousy,	envy	and	perhaps	insanity.

In	 the	 sixth	 house	 we	 reap	 from	 others	 as	 service	 the	 consequences	 of	 a
constructive	fifth	house,	or	else	illness	and	the	obligation	to	serve	others	follow
our	 wastefulness	 and	 self-indulgence	 in	 matters	 of	 self-expression,	 home
education,	 etc.	 In	 the	 ninth	 house	 the	 loss	 of	 sensations	 or	 the	 power	 of
relationship	(death,	bankruptcy,	etc.)	forces	us	to	take	a	“long	journey”	over	the
border	 .	 .	 .	 of	 our	 country	 or	 of	 this	 plane	 of	 existence.	 But	 if	 the	 house	 of
relationship	 and	 marriage	 has	 proven	 positive,	 the	 new	 power	 we	 get	 from	 the
consolidation	 of	 the	 opportunities	 accruing	 from	 human	 contacts	 enables	 us	 to
extend	 our	 operations,	 whether	 through	 physical	 trips	 or	 mental	 expansion	 of
consciousness.	At	the	 descendant	we	find	the	index	of	our	power	 of	sensation.
Sensations	 focalized	 and	 consolidated	 through	 the	 power	 that	 flows	 upward
through	the	spine	(Scorpio-Kundalini)	become	ultimately	abstract	thoughts	and
religious	at-one-ment	with	universal	ideas	(Sagittarius—ninth	house).

The	twelfth	house	signifies	negatively	the	vanishing	of	our	social	ideals	and
our	hopes—self-questioning	as	to	the	meaning	of	life.	The	prison	of	our	dreams
and	illusions	keeps	us	confined	until	we	emerge	with	a	new	vision,	or	are	forced
back	unenlightened	into	a	new	cycle	of	bondage.	Or	else	it	signifies	the	closing
chapter	of	a	period	well	lived	and	the	transition	to	a	new	birth	at	a	higher	level	of
selfhood	 whose	 foundations	 will	 have	 been	 our	 altruistic	 work	 for	 society	 and
our	friends,	inspired	as	it	was	by	noble	and	magnanimous	ideals.

In	order	to	make	the	foregoing	more	graphic	the	following	diagram	may	be
useful	 to	 the	 student,	 paralleling	 the	 conventional	 and	 the	 psychological-
philosophical	meanings	of	the	houses:

*	The	attribution	of	father	to	the	fourth	house,	and	of	mother	to	the	tenth	house	has	been	very	strongly
disputed.	 In	 medieval	 times	 the	 son	 followed	 nearly	 always	 his	 father’s	 profession,	 therefore	 as	 the

profession	 is	 always	 related	 to	 the	 tenth	 house	 the	 idea	 of	 father	 seemed	 also	 connected	 with	 the	 tenth

house,	especially	where	sons	were	concerned.	Also	many	astrologers	relate	the	signs	of	the	zodiac	to	the

houses	thus:	Aries	corresponds	to	the	first	house,	Cancer	to	the	fourth,	Capricorn	to	the	tenth.	As	Cancer	is

“ruled”	by	the	Moon	(which	symbolizes	the	mother)	and	Capricorn	by	Saturn	(which	symbolizes	the	father)

it	has	seemed	logical	to	relate	the	mother	to	the	fourth	house	and	the	father	to	the	tenth	house.	We	would	be

inclined	to	believe	that	these	co-relations	are	interchangeable,	according	to	the	level	of	being	at	which	one

establishes	itself.	A	co-relation	which	is	true	physiologically	may	have	to	be	reversed	at	the	psychological

level.	 The	 mother	 may	 dominate	 the	 physical	 home	 (fourth	 house);	 but	 the	 father	 may	 form	 the

psychological	home:	the	soul.

Such	a	charting	of	the	meanings	of	the	houses	does	not,	however,	exhaust	the
possibilities	 of	 significance.	 These	 possibilities	 are	 in	 fact	 infinite,	 just	 as	 the
possibilities	 of	 applications	 of	 any	 complex	 algebraic	 formula	 are	 practically
infinite.	 Every	 one	 who	 really	 understands	 the	 meaning	 of	 charting	 the	 twelve
basic	operations	of	selfhood	will	readily	see	that	new	sets	of	meanings	will	arise
each	 time	 we	 consider	 a	 new	 level	 of	 selfhood.	 The	 wheel	 of	 houses	 is	 a
universal	 formula.	 Wherever	 the	 polar	 oppositions	 of	 self	 and	 not-self,	 of
awareness	 and	 experience,	 of	 abstract	 and	 concrete,	 apply—there	 the	 wheel	 of
houses	can	be	used	most	efficiently	in	bringing	a	pattern	of	order	to	the	apparent
confusion	 of	 phenomena,	 whatever	 they	 be.	 Wherever	 any	 agglomeration	 of
substantial	elements	can	be	considered	as	an	organic	entity,	as	a	relatively	closed
circuit	of	life-energies,	there	the	wheel	of	houses	and	its	fourfold	and	twelvefold
differentiation	of	viewpoints	apply.	This	is	so	because	the	fact	that	life-energies
move	 in	 a	 closed	 circuit	 (metabolic	 action)	 makes	 of	 the	 collectivity	 of	 cells

which	these	energies	vitalize	an	organism.	Every	organism	is,	to	some	extent,	an
individual	 entity.	 Inasmuch	 as	 it	 is	 an	 individual	 entity,	 there	 will	 arise	 in	 it	 a
certain	 type	 of	 awareness	 (of	 self	 and	 of	 other	 selves)	 and	 a	 certain	 type	 of
concrete	 experience	 (subjective—as	 feeling	 or	 instinct;	 objective—as	 acquired
groupings	of	sensations,	or	thoughts).

It	is	true	that	in	all	kingdoms	below	man	there	is	very	little	awareness	of	self,
if	any;	and	very	little	sense	of	a	particular	formed	ego	as	a	basis	for	individual
self-expression.	 In	 other	 words,	 the	 subjective,	 below-the-horizon	 realm	 of
selfhood	 is	 not	 developed	 in	 the	 separate	 individual	 entity.	 But	 we	 may	 be
willing	to	say	that	such	a	realm	is	developed	in	the	vegetable	or	animal	species
as	a	whole—constituting	what	Bergson	calls	the	“Genius	of	the	Species.”

In	 man	 only,	 as	 far	 as	 we	 know,	 every	 specimen	 of	 the	 human	 species	 is,
potentially	at	least,	a	complete	individual.	The	“Genius	of	the	Species,”	that	is,
the	archetypal	reality	of	MAN	(what	the	Hindu	calls	the	“Manu”),	can	become	the
center	of	the	personality	when	the	latter	is	duly	“individuated.”	As	it	does	so	it
becomes	the	living	Christ,	the	God-within.	In	other	words,	a	man	ceases	to	be	a
creature	 of	 the	 Earth-surface—an	 animal.	 He	 begins	 to	 live	 both	 above	 and
below	 the	 horizon,	 objectively	 and	 subjectively.	 His	 own	 center	 becomes
identified	 with	 the	 center	 of	 the	 Earth.	 He	 thus	 becomes	 a	 planetary	 being—a
microcosm.

The	 lower	 hemisphere	 of	 the	 birth-chart	 refers	 therefore	 to	 the	 potential
formation	 and	 expression	 of	 the	 God-within.	 There,	 at	 the	 nadir	 point	 (the
“Midnight	Sun”	of	Masonry),	man’s	conscious	ego	is	born	in	the	manger	of	the
“feelings.”	 Then,	 after	 having	 been	 regenerated	 by	 the	 trials	 involved	 in	 all
human	relationship	and	in	social	living,	this	ego	eventually	becomes	more	and
more	inclusive.	The	center	of	collective	being,	which	is	symbolized	by	the	zenith
and	the	noon-point,	is	assimilated	by	the	individual	ego!	This	in	turn	gives	food
for	 a	 deeper	 awareness	 of	 self	 and	 others.	 Ultimately	 the	 four	 “angles”	 of	 the
chart	become	integrated	at	the	center	of	the	chart—or	in	another	sense	in	a	third
dimension,	as	the	apex	of	a	pyramid	built	upon	these	four	“angles.”	The	point	of
integration—or	individuation—is	what	Jung	calls:	the	Self.

In	Rosicrucian	symbology,	the	Self	is	the	Rose	that	blooms	at	the	center	of
the	cross.	It	is	also	the	fire	that	surges	from	the	whirling	center	of	the	Swastika.
It	is	the	apex	of	the	Egyptian	pyramid	—which	was	a	chamber	of	initiation.

### The	Unfolding	of	the	Individual	Self

From	 the	 foregoing	 it	 will	 be	 evident	 to	 the	 student	 of	 astrology	 that	 the
wheel	of	houses	is	inherently	to	be	interpreted	in	terms	of	becoming	rather	than
of	static	being.	It	is	a	time-pattern;	a	pattern	of	unfoldment,	recording	essentially
a	process.	And	this	process	is	the	great	psychological	process	of	individuation:
the	alchemical	“Great	Work”—the	Biblical	“building	of	the	Temple.”	MAN—the
universal	 Archetype	 or	 “Manu”—is	 crucified	 into	 the	 physiological	 entity	 (the
perfected	human	animal)	and	after	three	days	arises	as	the	Christ—the	perfected
human	“Individual.”

The	symbolism	of	these	“three	days”	is	susceptible	of	an	infinite	number	of
applications—just	as	is	the	symbolism	of	the	“seven	days”	of	creation.	The	latter
refers	to	the	building	of	the	physiological	entity;	and	in	a	larger	sense	to	that	of
the	planetary	Being	(thus	the	sevenfold	division	of	the	Great	Polar	Cycle).	The
former	 refers	 to	 the	 building	 of	 the	 human	 “individual,”	 as	 a	 psycho-mental
being.	 Astrologically	 speaking,	 we	 can	 use	 the	 wheel	 of	 houses	 to	 chart	 this
building	 of	 the	 human	 individual.	 We	 shall	 see	 that	 each	 “day”	 is	 in	 reality	 a
cycle	of	28	years.	Thus	the	entire	process	will	last	theoretically	84	years—which
is	the	cycle	of	revolution	of	Uranus	around	the	sun,	a	significant	fact	which	will
take	on	added	meaning	as	we	study	presently	the	Uranus-symbol.

The	 two	 processes	 (physiological	 and	 psycho-mental;	 or	 generic	 and
individual)	 are	 closely	 related;	 and	 this	 is	 curiously	 apparent	 when	 one	 studies
“kabbalistically”	 the	 number	 7.	 If	 one	 adds	 all	 the	 digits	 that	 come	 up	 to	 this
number	(Kabbalistic	addition	process)	one	gets	the	number	28;	for	1	+	2	+	3	+
4+	5	+	6	+	7	=	28.	But	if	one	carries	the	process	to	each	number	up	to	7	we	have
as	a	sum-total	the	number	84.	That	is	to	say	we	get	the	following	figuration:

The	 meaning	 of	 the	 “Kabbalistic	 addition”	 can	 be	 intuited	 perhaps	 from	 a
geometrical	illustration	of	the	process,	which	has	a	particular	significance	in	this

case.

### From	this	figure	made	up	of	28	equal	and	tangent	circles,	it	is	clear	that	the

number	28	reveals	by	such	an	analysis	that	it	refers	to	three	realms	of	being.

### The	outer	realm	is	marked	by	the	18	outer	circles;	the	middle	realm,	by	the	9

middle	circles;	and	the	inner	realm	by	the	1	central	circle.

### The	only	preceding	number	to	give	a	symmetrical	figure	centered	around	one

### circle	is	the	number	4;—kabbalistically	equal	to

### 10.	The	number	10	refers	to	the	cosmic;	but	number	28	is	the	number	of	triune
Man:	Man	as	spirit,	soul	and	body.	Spirit	is	1;	Soul	is	4;	Body	is	7.	The	number
of	the	perfected	individual	is	therefore	28.	But	the	fully	worked	out	process	of
individuation	 requires	 that	 each	 component	 factor	 (or	 number)	 be	 also	 fully
developed;	and	thus	the	duration	of	it	is	84	years.	By	developing	only	the	basic
numbers	(1,	4	and	7)	we	have	a	total	of	39;	that	is,	1	+	10	4-28.	At	the	age	of	39

man	reaches	a	condition	of	particular	significance	in	his	spiritual	development—
the	 fortieth	 year	 being	 also	 the	 seed-year	 of	 the	 decade	 40	 to	 50,	 which	 is	 the
fifth	decade,	MAN	is	also	 symbolized	as	a	five-pointed	star.	The	fifth	section	of
the	 star	 is	 the	 head—the	 organ	 of	 the	 creative.	 During	 this	 fifth	 decade	 a	 man
finds	his	work	of	destiny.	Indeed,	in	this	sense,	“life	begins	at	forty”!*

After	 this	 brief	 excursion	 into	 the	 realm	 of	 numerical	 or	 Kabbalistic
symbolism,	we	return	now	to	the	astrological	analysis	of	the	28-year	cycle.	Such
a	cycle,	then,	is	one	of	the	“days”	of	which	Jesus	spoke	when	he	said:	“Destroy
this	 temple	 and	 I	 shall	 raise	 it	 again	 in	 three	 days.”	 Each	 day	 represents,	 not	 a
literal	 cycle	 of	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth	 around	 its	 axis,	 but	 a	 cycle	 of	 rotation	 of
man’s	individual	self	around	its	spiritual	axis,	its	real	“I	am”	overshadowed	by
the	 spiritual	 Pole	 Star—the	 monad	 or	 “Father	 in	 Heaven”	 watching	 over	 every
human	being.

This	28-year	cycle	can	be	plotted	out	on	the	birth-chart.	In	other	words,	the
birth-chart	 is	 not	 only	 to	 be	 used	 as	 a	 space-pattern	 revealing	 the	 blue-print	 of
the	completed	selfhood,	but	the	time	sequence	of	the	operations	of	the	building
can	 be	 discovered	 also	 by	 starting	 from	 the	 Ascendant,	 the	 beginning	 of	 the
building,	and	following	along	the	circumference	of	the	chart	in	counterclockwise
motion.	 When	 the	 Ascendant	 is	 reached	 again	 the	 first	 cycle	 of	 twenty-eight
years	is	closed,	and	the	second	begins,	ending	with	the	56th	year;	the	third	28th
year	 cycle	 follows,	 coming	 to	 a	 close	 at	 the	 age	 of	 84,	 which	 marks	 the

theoretical	and	symbolical	completion	of	man’s	inner	temple.	This	is	the	end	of
the	process	of	Individuation.

However,	 the	 temple	 may	 never	 be	 completed,	 and	 in	 almost	 every	 case	 at
present	 is	 not	 completed.	 Just	 the	 same,	 whether	 fulfilled	 or	 not,	 the	 curve	 of
unfolding	 is	 there	 as	 a	 potentiality.	 Together	 with	 the	 blue-prints,	 the	 Great
Architect	(the	God	that	dwells	in	the	Pole	Star,	according	to	the	Chinese)	gives
man	a	time-schedule	of	operation.	The	space	structure	is	to	be	completed	within
a	 certain	 span	 of	 time,	 and	 the	 building	 operations	 are	 to	 proceed	 in	 a	 definite
order;	 this	 part	 of	 the	 blue-print	 first,	 then	 that	 one,	 then	 the	 next,	 etc.	 The
foundation,	 the	 first	 story	 and	 the	 second	 story	 including	 the	 great	 Dome
covering	all.	Thus	three	periods:	from	physical	birth	to	the	age	of	twenty-eight;
then	from	what	ought	to	be	the	psycho-mental	birth	(28)	to	56;	finally,	from	this
potential	third	or	spiritual	birth	to	the	end	(84).

This	 again	 corresponds	 to	 the	 age-old	 tradition	 that	 the	 nature	 of	 man	 is
threefold:	 body,	 soul,	 spirit.	 Moreover	 the	 three	 great	 28-year	 cycles	 form	 the
true	 basis	 for	 the	 ancient	 idea	 of	 first-born,	 twice-born	 and	 thrice-born.	 But
popular	 Brahmanism	 accelerated	 the	 occasion	 of	 the	 second	 birth	 for	 easily
understandable,	 practical	 purposes.	 During	 the	 first	 28	 years,	 man	 perfects
(always	theoretically)	his	physio-psychological	body,	or	better,	his	race-self.	He
fulfills	 his	 ancestry	 and	 the	 past	 of	 his	 family	 and	 race.	 Then	 he	 emerges	 as	 a
new-born	 individual	 self.	 Having	 discriminated,	 selected,	 rejected	 and	 chosen,
out	 of	 what	 the	 past	 of	 mankind	 offered	 to	 him,	 the	 foundation	 for	 his	 own
individuality,	 he	 builds	 on	 the	 foundation	 of	 this	 past	 (for	 every	 temple	 must
have	a	foundation)	the	structure	of	his	individual	selfhood.

Finally,	if	this	structure	is	at	all	completed,	he	reaches	at	the	age	of	fifty-six
the	 point	 where	 the	 universal	 Spirit	 is	 born	 within	 him—the	 third	 or	 spiritual
birth.	This	is	symbolized	by	the	building	of	the	dome	of	the	temple—a	replica	of
the	vault	of	the	sky,	itself	a	symbol	of	the	Universal	Self,	or	God.	When	that	also
is	 completed	 man	 passes	 to	 other	 spheres;	 consciously	 and	 without	 loss	 of
personal	identity,	if	he	has	built	for	himself	a	“vehicle	of	immortality.”	The	first
cycle	sees	potentially	the	completion	of	the	body	of	earth;	the	second	cycle,	that
of	 the	 body	 of	 sound;	 the	 third,	 that	 of	 the	 body	 of	 light	 Out	 of	 the	 physical
mother’s	womb	an	organism	of	 flesh	and	bones	is	born.	At	the	second	birth,	a
Tone	sounds	forth,	the	 Ishwara	 or	 Logos,	 the	 Voice	 of	 the	 God-Within.	 At	 the
third	birth,	Light	pours	upon	the	consecrated	Self	—as	Wagner	symbolizes	it	in
the	Grail	consecration	of	the	last	act	of	Parsifal.

Each	 cycle	 represents	 a	 complete	 revolution	 of	 the	 entire	 “pattern	 of
selfhood,”	i.e.,	of	the	axis	of	the	birth-chart.	This	sym-bolical	revolution	is	timed
in	 such	 a	 manner	 that	 every	 seven	 years	 one	 arm	 of	 the	 cross	 comes	 to	 the
position	which	the	succeeding	one	occupied	originally.	In	other	words,	at	the	age
of	 seven,	 the	 Ascendant	 comes	 to	 the	 position	 occupied	 at	 birth	 by	 the	 Imum
Coeli,	the	latter	to	that	of	the	natal	Descendant,	etc.	At	fourteen,	the	Ascendant
comes	 to	 the	 birth-position	 of	 the	 Descendant;	 at	 twenty-one,	 of	 the	 Mid-
Heaven.	 At	 twenty-eight	 it	 reaches	 its	 own	 natal	 position;	 and	 a	 second	 cycle
begins,	in	the	same	way.

Theoretically,	 it	 is	 the	 entire	 axial	 cross	 which	 rotates	 in	 28	 years.	 For
practical	purposes,	the	revolution	of	the	Ascendant	is	usually	the	most	valuable
to	study.	For	the	Ascendant	symbolizes	the	very	essence	of	self,	man’s	attitude
and	 path	 toward	 himself.	 It	 represents	 that	 particular	 viewpoint	 on	 life,	 that
particular	quality	of	life	of	which	the	man,	as	an	individual	identity,	is	to	be	the
representative.	It	is	man’s	standard	of	values	as	an	individual	self.	Thus	it	is	the
very	center	of	the	whole	consciousness.	As	it	is	seen	to	revolve	throughout	the
28-year	 cycle,	 one	 gets	 a	 most	 valuable	 graph	 of	 the	 sequential	 unfoldment	 of
man’s	original	or	central	attitude	toward	life.

In	 the	 same	 manner,	 one	 can	 trace	 also	 with	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 value	 the
successive	transformations	of	the	three	other	basic	points	of	consciousness.	The
change	in	man’s	attitude	toward	others,	toward	the	outer	world	in	general,	will
be	plotted	out	by	the	revolution	of	the	Descendant.	His	fundamental	attitude	in
thinking	 and	 feeling	 can	 be	 deduced	 from	 the	 symbolic	 motion	 of	 the	 vertical
axis	of	the	birth-chart.	Extremely	valuable	indications	will	be	given	in	each	case,
provided	one	does	not	expect	to	find	exact	accuracy	in	terms	of	the	occurrence
of	concrete	events.	In	this	entire	discussion	we	do	not	deal	with	the	mapping	of
outer	life-happenings,	but	with	changes	in	the	inner	operation	of	the	individual
self;	that	is,	with	changes	of	psychological	points	of	view	and	of	inner	attitudes
toward	the	whole	of	life,	subjective	and	objective.	These	may	be	related	to	outer
events;	 but,	 even	 then,	 what	 matters	 is	 the	 direction	 of	 the	 subjective	 changes
rather	 than	 any	 exact	 date	 to	 which	 one	 might	 “pin	 it	 down.”	 The	 type	 of
approach	 befitting	 an	 analysis	 of	 these	 cycles	 of	 unfolding	 is	 purely
psychological.

Such	 an	 analysis	 serves	 also	 to	 check	 up	 and	 interpret	 mathematically	 the
general	 findings	 of	 psychology	 concerning	 the	 progressive	 development	 of	 the
human	 psyche	 and	 of	 its	 functions	 or	 modes	 of	 activity.	 It	 also	 verifies	 the
ancient	 “occult”	 idea	 of	 the	 division	 of	 human	 life	 into	 7-year	 cycles,	 each	 of

which	marks	the	unfolding	of	one	particular	aspect	of	the	individual’s	character
and	means	of	self-expression.	The	first	seven	years	see	the	development	of	the
power	of	self-awareness,	or	intuition—as	understood	by	C.	G.	Jung.	The	young
child	 sees	 everything	 in	 terms	 of	 personality.	 It	 is	 hard	 for	 him	 to	 differentiate
between	 objective	 and	 subjective,	 inanimate	 and	 animate,	 because	 he	 lives	 so
completely	 in	 a	 subjective	 world.	 He	 has	 an	 “intuition”	 of	 things	 rather	 than
objective	perceptions.	He	has	not	yet	succumbed	to	the	“heresy	of	separateness”
which	creates	a	chasm	between	subject	and	object	(or	other	subjects),	between	I
and	Thou.	Thus	the	mystic,	who	strives	to	reach	complete	at-one-ment	with	the
All,	 is	 urged	 to	 become	 again	 “as	 a	 little	 child”—a	 stage	 which	 is	 related
theoretically	to	the	period	after	the	third	birth,	between	fifty-six	and	sixty-three.
This	first	septenate	corresponds	also	to	the	infancy	of	mankind,	when	man	saw
in	 every	 object	 a	 psychic	 entity	 or	 “spirit,”	 when	 the	 wall	 between	 the	 unseen
(subjective)	and	the	seen	(objective)	was	almost	non-existent.	In	a	general	sense
it	represents	the	type	of	approach	to	life	called	animism.

From	the	age	of	seven	to	that	of	fourteen,	the	feelings	mature.	By	“feelings”
is	 meant,	 we	 must	 repeat	 once	 more,	 the	 direct	 judgments	 placed	 upon
experiences	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 the	 previously	 unfolded	 awareness	 of	 self.	 The
abstract	self,	intuitively	apprehended,	becomes	around	seven	a	concrete	soul,	or
ego.	This	ego	enables	the	child	to	have	strongly	subjective	experiences.	It	is	the
age	of	creative	self-expression,	as	every	progressive	educator	will	say	(the	fifth
house	period	around	the	ages	of	nine	and	ten).	The	result	of	this	is	often	illness,
the	crisis	of	puberty,	at	any	rate	(sixth	house	period).

At	 fourteen,	 true	 contacts	 with	 the	 outer	 world	 begin.	 The	 objective	 world
becomes	 definitely	 separated	 from
the	 subjective.	 This	 means	 sexual
development:	facing	the	other	sex,	the	enemy	and	the	mate.	This	means	fear,	not
knowing	 how	 to	 “fit	 in,”	 not	 feeling	 secure	 in	 a	 world	 that	 confronts	 one
dangerously	and	with	which	somehow—but	how?—one	must	become	adjusted.
At	 twenty-one,	 mind,	 which	 had	 been	 maturing	 out	 of	 the	 play	 (or	 drama)	 of
objective	relationship,	becomes	consolidated	by	public	life,	by	outer	experience
on	the	basis	of	social	responsibility.	Man	comes	of	age.

Then	mind	has	to	prove	itself	and	to	find	its	own	ideals,	its	own	friends.	This
is	the	twelfth	house	stage.	At	the	middle	point	of	this	7-year	cycle,	that	is,	at	the
age	of	twenty-four	and	a	half	(theoretically	at	least),	man	faces	the	great	crisis	of
discrimination	between	various	types	of	ideals	and	companions.	He	has	to	“make
up	 his	 mind”	 about	 what	 he	 is	 going	 to	 be.	 Usually	 this	 determines	 the	 nature
and	character	of	the	“second	birth”	at	twenty-eight;	not,	however,	before	a	period

of	 readjustment	 is	 passed	 through,	 perhaps	 at	 the	 cost	 of	 deep	 suffering,	 the
twelfth	house	stage	(around	twenty-six	and	twenty-seven).

What	this	second	birth	is	to	be	depends	on	the	results	of	the	entire	first	28-
year	 cycle.	 The	 new	 cycle	 will	 see,	 like	 its	 predecessor,	 a	 progressive
differentiation	and	development	of	the	four	basic	faculties	of	the	Self	and	their
subdivisions;	but	now	at	the	level	of	truly	individual	selfhood—if	such	level	can
at	 all	 be	 reached;	 which	 of	 course	 depends	 on	 what	 occurred	 during	 the	 first
cycle	 (that	 of	 racial	 selfhood).	 Racial,	 individual,	 universal	 selfhood-three
cycles;	one	certainty,	and	two	potentialities.	If	the	level	of	individual	selfhood	is
not	 reached,	 at	 least	 in	 seed,	 at	 twenty-eight,	 then	 the	 human	 being	 merely
conforms	to	the	race-pattern	of	consciousness,	and	goes	on	living	as	one	among
countless	 thousands.	 He	 is	 one	 of	 the	 thousands	 of	 seeds	 which	 drop	 to	 the
ground,	yet	do	not	take	root.

This	 does	 not	 mean	 that	 a	 youth	 of	 twenty-eight	 will	 become	 a	 real
individual,	 but	 that	 he	 then	 begins	 the	 stage	 of	 truly	 individual	 development.
Before,	he	fulfilled	the	past	(of	his	race,	and	of	his	own	Self,	if	reincarnation	is
accepted).	 Now,	 he	 is	 building	 the	 present.	 After	 fifty-six,	 he	 will	 mature	 and
become	the	seeds	of	the	future	(of	his	race	and	of	his	own	Self)	.	.	.	if	he	can.
The	 year	 thirty-five	 sees	 the	 revolving	 Ascendant	 at	 the	 Imum	 Coeli.	 This
corresponds	at	a	higher	level	(if	the	second	birth	is	a	success)	to	what	occurred	at
the	 age	 of	 seven.	 From	 about	 thirty-seven	 to	 forty	 is	 again	 the	 stage	 of	 self-
expression	 (fifth	 house	 stage)	 at	 this	 psycho-mental	 level.	 New	 ideas	 are	 born,
new	departures	initiated;	the	truly	individual	work	of	the	Destiny	becomes	clear.
It	will	manifest	objectively	around	the	year	forty-two,	when	man	again	faces	the
outer	world	and	his	work.	This	is	a	turning	point	again:	a	new	type	of	adjustment
is	 demanded,	 often	 very	 hard	 to	 make.	 The	 psychoanalyst	 recruits	 most	 of	 his
patients	 from	 this	 period	 of	 life,	 because	 a	 definite	 mental	 psychological
reorientation	is	then	imperative.	It	is	the	“change	of	life,”	the	second	puberty—a
most	interesting	time,	at	least	for	the	psychologist!

Then	 comes	 forty-nine,	 often	 the	 time	 of	 greatest	 social	 activity.	 Man
becomes	 a	 power	 in	 human	 society,	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 whatever	 individual
accomplishment	he	can	produce.	At	fifty-six,	the	third	cycle	begins.	It	is	the	time
for	man	to	face	the	Spirit,	and	perhaps	to	become	transfigured	by	the	Spirit—or
by	his	Work.	Man	becomes	orientated	toward	death	or	immortality.	Death,	if	he
has	 been	 unsuccessful.	 Immortality,	 if	 successful.	 In	 what,	 successful?	 In
building	 his	 own	 vehicle	 of	 immortality.	 Which	 means	 one	 or	 more	 of	 three
things:

1)	Success	in	building	a	family	and	having	become	an	“ancestor”	whom
his	posterity	will	physically	and	psychologically	perpetuate.	For	instance,	the
direct	descendant	to	Confucius,	by	male	descent,	is	now	living,	a	young	man
—after	 close	 to	 eighty	 generations,	 if	 we	 are	 not	 mistaken.	 This	 is	 physio-
psychological	immortality.

2)	 Success	 in	 building	 a	 Work,	 which	 will	 be	 remembered	 generation
after	 generation.	 This	 is	 the	 case	 of	 all	 great	 geniuses	 in	 religion,	 art,
literature,	science,	politics.

### 3)	Success	in	building	a	“spiritual	body”	in	which	the	Self	may	continue

to	function	consciously	after	death.	This	is	spiritual	immortality.

At	sixty-three	we	see	the	combined	culmination	of	the	cycles	of	7	and	of	9
years.	In	one	sense	at	least	spirit	and	matter,	or	individual	and	collective	(7	and
9)	 can	 then	 be	 fully	 harmonized.	 At	 seven,	 thirty-five	 and	 sixty-three	 the
conscious	ego	is	stirred	to	its	depth	by	a	new	life.	Then	seventy	sees	the	“third
puberty”	with	the	entrance	into	the	new	relationship—which	often	means	death.
And	 so	 tradition	 speaks	 of	 the	 life	 of	 man	 as	 being	 normally	 “three	 score	 and
ten.”	What	is	meant	is	that	at	the	age	of	seventy	the	last	stage	begins,	when	man
relates	himself	to	a	new	life.	Usually	the	body	cannot	stand	the	strain	of	this	new
type	 of	 relationship,	 and	 this	 means	 death.	 But	 if	 the	 organism	 (physiological
and	 psychological)	 can	 repolarize	 itself	 according	 to	 a	 new	 rhythm	 of	 life-
contacts,	then	the	real	inner	world	may	open;	and	man	learns	to	be	familiar	with
the	 rhythm	 of	 the	 “other	 world,”	 with	 entities	 or	 energies	 of	 the	 “beyond”—
whatever	may	be	meant	exactly	by	the	term.	He	becomes	the	wise	old	Sage	in
whom	the	collective	acts	in	a	new	way,	bringing	to	earth	visions	of	a	world	of
pure	 and	 serene	 significance.	 If	 this	 happens,	 a	 further	 change	 of	 magnetism
occurs	at	seventy-seven	(7	times	11)—because	11	is	the	number	of	the	Sun	and
of	 the	 circulation	 of	 solar	 energy	 throughout	 the	 solar	 system.	 Then,	 at	 eighty-
four,	 a	 “fourth	 birth”	 occurs,	 which	 takes	 man	 altogether	 into	 a	 new	 realm	 of
significance	 and	 destiny:	 which	 means	 disintegration	 of	 the	 personality	 or
(relative)	immortality.

Thus	the	cycle	of	individual	destiny—as	it	archetypally	is.	Every	personality
weaves	its	particular	patterns	within	this	framework,	often	obliterating	outwardly
the	big	structural	outlines.	But	the	more	significant	the	destiny,	the	more	true	to
the	essential	cycle	as	outlined	here:	likewise	the	more	significant	the	individual,
the	more	true	he	is	to	the	archetypal	form	of	Man	within	a	particular	planetary

era.	 This	 is	 the	 great	 paradox.	 The	 supremely	 individuated	 personality	 reveals
the	most	perfectly	in	its	outline	of	character,	consciousness	and	destiny	the	form
of	generic	Man.	The	most	individual	becomes	the	most	universal,	just	because	of
being	the	most	individual.	This	is	because	he	becomes	an	absolute	manifestation
of	 the	 creative.	 He	 becomes	 a	 “solar	 Hero”—an	 Exemplar	 or	 Avatar,	 whose
deeds	and	whose	personality	are	universally	significant.

### ______________

*	The	formula	implied	in	these	paragraphs	can	be	used	to	determine	the	archetypal	significance	of	all	the
main	turning	points	in	the	cycle	of	human	life;	but	it	needs	to	be	applied	with	care	and	understanding.	We
might	give	more	instances	to	clarify	the	matter.

If	we	consider	15	circles	arranged	in	the	way	above	described	we	see	that	they	constitute	two	series—an
outer	triangle	of	12,	an	inner	triangle	of	3.	The	number	15	is	the	“kabbalistic	sum”	of	5;	but	if	this	sum	is
fully	developed,	following	the	above	procedure,	it	gives	the	number	35.	As	we	shall	see	presently,	35	is	the
point	in	life	which	brings	symbolically	the	Marriage	of	Heaven	and	Earth.	It	is	the	working	out	of	number	5
—the	number	of	the	Great	Initiator.	The	15-circle	figure	is	symmetrical,	but	contains	only	two	series:	the
inner	spiritual	circle	is	still	missing.	This	inner	circle	will	appear	in	the	figure	developed	from	the	number	6,
giving	the	years	22	and	56	(cf.	left	and	right	columns	of	figures	above).	These	are	years	of	spiritual	arousal;
but	the	figure	lacks	foundation	with	only	22	circles.	It	will	acquire	this	foundation	and	become	symmetrical
with	28	circles—the	full	number	of	individuation.

## THE	SIGNS	OF	THE	ZODIAC

What	Is	Actually	the	Zodiac?
We	could	easily	proceed	with	our	study	of	the	significance	attributed	to	the	signs
of	 the	 zodiac,	 singly	 and	 in	 their	 traditional	 groupings;	 but	 to	 do	 so	 would	 be
taking	 things	 for	 granted	 and	 shrinking,	 in	 fact,	 from	 facing	 serious	 problems
concerning	the	zodiac	and	the	place	it	occupies	in	any	coherent	and	holistically
logical	 system	 of	 astrological	 interpretation.	 Thus	 we	 must	 again	 return	 to
foundations	 and	 try	 to	 fathom	 what	 are	 the	 facts	 really	 involved	 in	 the
establishment	of	a	zodiac.

The	 Ptolemaic	 zodiac	 has	 been	 already	 described	 as	 a	 belt	 of	 creative	 fire
surrounding	 the	 Earth,	 and	 focalized	 upon	 the	 Earth	 mainly	 by	 the	 Sun	 and
secondarily	 by	 the	 planets.	 The	 center	 of	 this	 belt	 of	 fire	 is	 the	 ecliptic,	 the
apparent	 path	 of	 the	 Sun.	 The	 signs	 of	 the	 zodiac	 are	 identified	 with	 the
constellations	 (at	 least	 in	 pre-Ptolemaic	 astrology)	 and	 as	 well	 with	 celestial
hierarchies	 of	 Cosmic	 Builders.	 These	 hierarchies	 constitute	 collectively	 the
Universal	Mind,	the	operative	creative	energy	of	the	macrocosm.	The	zodiac	as	a
whole	is	a	vast	cosmic	lens	focalizing	upon	the	earth	the	combined	powers	of	the
hierarchies,	thereby	making	of	the	Earth	as	a	whole,	or	of	Man-in-the-whole,	a
microcosm.

As	 the	 Sun	 passes	 in	 turn	 in	 front	 of	 the	 twelve	 zodiacal	 constellations	 the
operative	processes	of	life	on	Earth	are	started	and	pushed	to	completion.	Spring
and	Fall	are	logical	starting	points	as,	in	the	temperate	zone,	they	mark	definite
changes	of	season,	and	alter	 the	physiognomy	of	the	Earth-surface	through	the
season’s	 effect	 upon	 vegetation.	 This	 obvious	 fact	 is	 made	 more	 precise	 by
measuring	 the	 changes	 of	 location	 of	 sunrises	 and	 sunsets.	 The	 Sun	 sets	 at	 its
southernmost	 point	 at	 the	 winter	 solstice;	 then	 “moves	 northward”	 (and	 also
closer	 to	 the	 zenith)	 until	 it	 reaches	 its	 northernmost	 point	 at	 the	 summer
solstice.	Thus	the	solar	year	normally	divides	itself	into	two	halves:	“When	the

Sun	moves	northward”	and	“when	the	Sun	moves	southward.”	The	first	half	is
spiritual,	 the	 second	 material—in	 most	 occult-mythological	 systems.	 The
equinoctial	 points,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 being	 the	 time	 when	 the	 Sun	 seems	 to
stand	still,	represent	points	of	balance.

In	these	ancient	systems	the	whole	year	is	seen	as	a	great	symphony	drama	of
integration	 under	the	supreme	leadership	of	 the	Sun,	and	 with	secondary	work
being	performed	by	the	celestial	soloists:	the	planets.	It	is	a	drama	of	collective
integration,	affecting	the	race	as	a	whole,	the	planet	as	a	whole.	There	is	no	real
astrological	 individual	 integration.	 Individual	 integration	 is	 then	 reserved	 to
secret	initiation;	and,	in	a	sense,	it	is	not	individual	“integration,”	but	rather	the
assumption	of	an	earth-body	by	a	super-earthly	entity—a	Star.	And	so	initiation
is	then	related	to	star-cycles;	as	can	be	seen	from	studying	what	remains	of	the
process	 of	 Egyptian	 initiation	 that	 took	 place	 in	 the	 pyramid,	 with	 telescopic
orifices	pointing	at	certain	stars	connected	with	the	initiatory	process.

There	is	then	no	astrology	of	the	individual	and	no	public	knowledge	of	the
fact	 of	 the	 axial	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth.	 The	 definite	 public	 discovery	 of	 the
Earth’s	rotation	corresponds	with	the	beginning	of	the	age	of	individualism,	the
Renaissance—another	 “proof”	 of	 the	 correctness	 of	 our	 symbolism!	 The
Pythagoreans	in	Greece	knew	about	the	Earth’s	rotation,	but	it	was	with	them	a
more	or	less	sacred	and	secret	matter—just	as	was	the	process	of	individuation,
then	purely	a	matter	of	secret	initiation.

Now,	this	fact	of	the	public	discovery	of	the	Earth’s	rotation	around	the	polar
axis	 and	 of	 its	 revolution	 around	 the	 Sun	 upset	 completely	 the	 basis	 of
astrological	symbolism.	At	any	rate,	it	brought	about	a	cleavage	between	nascent
astronomy	and	traditional	astrology.	What	astrologers	did	not	see,	and	even	now
have	 not	 yet	 seen	 fully,	 is	 that	 the	 sphericity	 of	 the	 Earth	 and	 the	 fact	 of	 its
rotation	 introduced	 an	 utterly	 new	 sense	 of	 space,	 which	 necessitated	 a
revaluation	 of	 the	 zodiac.	 In	 Ptolemaic	 astrology	 there	 was	 no	 fundamental
difference	between	the	revolving	motion	of	the	sphere	of	the	fixed	stars	and	of
the	various	planetary	heavens.	But	now	that	the	Earth	rotates	around	its	axis,	a
dualism	of	motion	is	made	obvious:	the	dualism	of	axial	rotation,	which,	as	we
saw,	 gives	 birth	 to	 all	 individual	 factors,	 and	 of	 orbital	 revolution	 in	 which	 all
planets	partake.

In	 other	 words,	 the	 unity	 of	 the	 zodiac	 is	 broken	 up:	 that	 which	 was	 the
symbol	 of	 the	 simple	 operation	 of	 life	 as	 it	 builds	 forms,	 bodies,	 and	 souls,
becomes	a	complex	system	of	motions	with	at	least	two	basic	types	of	meaning.

And	we	must	face	that	fact.	We	must	either	stick	to	a	Ptolemaic	world	and	say
that	 we	 are	 dealing	 purely	 with	 a	 system	 of	 life-symbolism	 based	 on	 apparent
motion	and	on	the	concrete	data	given	by	our	senses,	or	else	we	must	produce
new	 evidences	 and	 new	 theories	 to	 explain	 the	 zodiac	 in	 an	 intellectual,
scientific	way.	The	difference	between	the	Ptolemaic	and	the	modern	system	is
the	 difference	 between	 direct	 sense-perception	 and	 intellectual	 knowledge.
Astrology	must	choose	which	it	wishes	to	follow.

Our	point	of	view	is	that	if	we	adopt	our	modern	astronomical	outlook,	we
must	cease	to	consider	the	Ptolemaic	zodiac	as	the	basic	factor	in	astrology;	and
instead	we	have	to	emphasize	the	circle,	or	dial,	of	houses.	For	with	the	latter	we
are	doing,	in	our	new	way,	what	the	ancients	did	when	they	spoke	of	the	zodiac
as	the	symbol	of	the	yearly	drama	of	integration—collective	and	planetary.

As	 we	 wrote	 a	 moment	 ago,	 there	 was	 no	 conception	 of	 a	 real	 type	 of
individual	 integration,	 except	 insofar	 as	 the	 secret	 process	 of	 initiation	 was
concerned.	Individual	integration	is	what	C.	G.	Jung	calls	“individuation.”	And
what	we	ought	to	realize	is	that	this	process	of	individuation	will	in	time	take	the
place	of	the	process	of	initiation.	It	is	no	longer	the	Sun	that	turns,	focusing	the
stellar	 spaces	 of	 boundless	 life	 upon	 the	 collective	 Earth.	 But	 the	 Earth	 now
turns,	and	this	rotation	has	an	individual	significance	for	the	individual	man.	It
becomes,	in	a	larger	sense,	the	symbol	of	the	process	of	individuation.

We	studied	this	process	actually	when	we	dealt	with	the	three	28-year	cycles
of	human	life—measured	along	the	dial	of	houses.	Thus	this	dial	of	houses	can
be	considered	now	as	the	basic	factor,	instead	of	the	solar	zodiac;	as	a	pattern	of
integration	 or	 life-fulfillment.	 The	 individual	 can	 experience	 his	 own	 cycles	 of
consciousness	 through	 such	 symbolical	 cycles	 of	 Earth-rotation:	 for	 he	 is	 now
centered,	at	least	potentially,	in	his	own	Pole	Star	—and	is	no	longer	a	creature
of	the	Sun,	with	open	solar	plexus	through	which	the	formative	energies	of	life
pour.

The	 zodiac	 remains,	 of	 course,	 the	 pattern	 of	 collective	 development	 and
universal	 life-functioning;	 but	 as	 we	 emphasize	 the	 psychological	 process	 of
individuation,	we	must	also	emphasize	the	houses	as	a	set	of	points	of	reference,
i.e.,	 as	 determining	 the	 basic	 cycles	 of	 selfhood.	 And	 yet	 the	 beauty	 of	 the
symbolism	is	shown	in	this:	That	nothing	actually	is	changed	except	the	point	of
view.	This	will	be	made	clear	at	once	in	the	following	way.

“The	year	is	the	day	of	the	Lord.”	But	who	is	the	Lord,	astrologically?	It	is
the	North	Pole,	the	integrative	end	or	head	of	the	planetary	“I	am”	(polar	axis).

And	we	all	know	that,	theoretically	at	least,	at	the	North	Pole	the	year	is	divided
into	a	6-month	day-time	and	a	6-month	night-time!	Truly	the	year	of	the	North
Pole	 is	 a	 “day”;	 and	 we	 find	 thus	 that	 here	 our	 dial	 of	 houses	 applies	 in	 a
modified	manner:	6	months,	the	Sun	is	below	the	horizon—6	months,	above	the
horizon:	 a	 planetary	 day-and-night	 cycle,	 and	 thus	 the	 possibility	 for	 a	 dial	 of
houses	measuring	the	twelvefold	process	of	consciousness	during	this	“day”	of
the	Lord!

This	is	most	logical,	if	we	realize	that	the	solar	year	is	originally	a	record	of
the	 changes	 of	 season.	 But	 these	 changes	 of	 season	 are	 due	 to	 the	 fact	 of	 the
inclination	of	the	Earth’s	axis;	which	is	also	the	cause	for	the	6-month	day-time,
and	 6-month	 night-time	 experienced	 (again	 relatively	 speaking)	 at	 the	 poles.
This	 shows	 that	 what	 is	 a	 year	 cycle	 (collective)	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 temperate
zones,	is	a	day	cycle	(individual)	in	relation	to	the	poles.	We	may	interpret	this
by	 saying	 that	 what	 is	 the	 collective	 for	 cells	 within	 an	 entire	 organism,	 is
individual	in	reference	to	this	organism	as	a	whole.	Individual	and	collective	are
relative	terms.	Relative	to	what?	To	the	point	of	view	taken.

As	the	Bible	and	all	occult	books	say,	men	are	cells	in	the	body	of	the	Lord.
Polar	astrology	deals	with	the	planetary	Individual	(the	“Lord”),	and	his	cycle	of
individuation	is	the	year.	He	functions	solely	through	the	polar	axis,	and	the	facts
concerning	 this	 polar	 axis	 (inclination,	 gyration,	 etc.)	 are	 the	 bases	 for	 the
symbolism	of	a	planetary-polar	astrology.	The	fact	of	axial	inclination,	coupled
with	that	of	revolution	of	the	whole	planet	around	the	Sun,	constitutes	the	basis
for	the	polar	“day”—just	as	the	fact	of	rotation	of	the	surface	of	the	globe	around
its	axis	causes	the	“day”	of	us,	men	.	.	.	cells	of	the	planetary	body.

However,	being	cells,	we	relate	ourselves	one	to	the	other	constantly—and	it
is	this	relation,	this	collective	interchange,	which	is	pictured	symbolically	in	the
zodiac.	 In	 this	 case	 we	 may	 consider	 the	 Earth	 as	 a	 huge	 body	 in	 which	 men-
cells	“move	and	have	their	being.”	If	the	zodiac	is	a	picture	of	the	motions	and
relations	of	these	men-cells	within	the	Earth-body,	then	it	follows	logically	that
the	 signs	 of	 the	 zodiac	 represent	 anatomical	 divisions	 of	 the	 Earth-body.
However,	it	is	not	the	material	planet	which	is	to	be	considered,	but	the	planet	as
a	field	of	 relationships.	This	 field	 is	 really	 created	 by	 the	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth
and	the	magnetic	currents	generated	by	the	poles.	It	is	also	connected	with	the
ionosphere	 (above	 the	 stratosphere),	 influenced	 by	 the	 ultra-violet	 rays	 of	 the
Sun.	In	brief,	the	zodiac	is	what	astrologers-scientists	call	the	“magnetic	field”	of
the	 Earth,	 what	 occultists	 call	 the	 “aura	 of	 the	 Earth,”	 or	 the	 auric	 egg	 of	 the
planetary	Being.

Abstractly,	it	is	the	realm	where	all	relationships	between	all	living	beings	on
Earth	 are	 interwoven.	 It	 is	 the	 great	 matrix	 of	 the	 collective,	 energized	 and
stirred	rhythmically	by	the	solar	radiations	and	presumably	also	by	cosmic	rays
and	the	like.	It	is	a	magnetic	field—but	it	can	be	pictured	less	scientifically	as	an
envelope	 of	 fire	 or	 electricity	 within	 which	 the	 Earth	 rotates,	 but	 which	 itself
remains	 constantly	 polarized	 in	 the	 same	 direction:	 toward	 the	 pole	 of	 the
ecliptic.

This	 line	 of	 the	 poles	 of	 the	 ecliptic	 is	 the	 ideal	 axis	 of	 the	 Earth	 around
which	the	actual	axis	gyrates	in	25,868	years.	The	zodiac	can	thus	be	conceived
as	the	ideal	Earth,	the	archetypal	body	of	the	planetary	Whole	in	which	men	live
as	cells	and	groups	of	cells.

It	 is	 probable	 that	 such	 a	 statement	 will	 seem	 to	 conflict	 with	 our	 previous
ones	 indicating	 that	 the	 zodiac	 was	 the	 result	 of	 the	 orbital	 revolution	 of	 the
Earth	around	the	Sun	and	a	background	for	the	orbital	movements	of	all	planets.
But	we	must	also	remember	that	we	added:	Always	in	relation	to	the	Earth!

Remembering	this,	we	can	say	that	the	zodiac	is	the	solar	system	in	relation
to	the	Earth.	One	step	further:	It	is	the	whole	of	the	planetary-solar	relationship
projected	 upon	 the	 solar,	 or	 spiritual,	 envelope	 of	 the	 Earth.	 Or	 again:	 It	 is	 the
zone	 around	 the	 Earth	 where	 the	 collective	 emanations	 of	 the	 Earth	 integrate
with	 the	 collective	 emanations	 from	 Sun	 and	 planets.	 And	 it	 may	 very	 well	 be
that	this	zone	corresponds	actually,	in	the	regions	surrounding	the	Earth,	to	the
equatorial	belt	on	the	surface	of	the	globe.	As	a	matter	of	fact	it	does	not	matter
from	our	standpoint	what	definition	or	formulation	one	adopts.

The	 zodiac,	 as	 Western	 astrology	 uses	 it,	 is	 both	 an	 idea	 and	 a	 fact.	 As	 an
idea,	 it	 is	 an	 expression	 of	 the	 combined	 movements	 of	 and	 relationships
between	 Sun,	 Moon,	 planets,	 and	 the	 Earth.	 It	 is	 an	 expression	 of	 collective
being	and	of	relationship	between	the	parts	or	organs	which	together	constitute
an	organic	whole.	It	is	the	expression	of	organic	wholeness.	As	everything	has	to
be	related	to	the	observer	on	Earth,	we	may	project	this	“expression”	around	the
Earth	 and	 call	 it	 an	 “auric	 egg”	 or	 “ideal	 Earth,”	 or	 whatever	 indicates	 the
wholeness	of	life	in	dynamic	operation.	We	may	even	project	the	zodiac-idea	on
the	Earth	surface	and	so	determine	which	locality	belongs	to	which	sign	of	the
zodiac—as	 Johndro	 and	 Counsil	 have	 done,	 each	 starting	 with	 a	 particular
“world-basis”	for	the	projection.	In	every	case,	what	is	being	done	is	a	charting
of	collective	elements	and	of	organic	interchange.

This	 is	 made	 even	 more	 evident	 by	 the	 traditional	 projection	 of	 the	 zodiac

upon	 the	 human	 body—or,	 which	 is	 less	 usual	 but	 better,	 the	 human	 “aura”	 or
auric	egg.	Here	we	see	a	particular	sign	of	the	zodiac	assigned	to	every	part	of
the	body.	Indeed,	the	zodiac	is	then	a	pattern	of	organic	interchange,	a	charting
of	the	circuits	of	the	life-force	(Sun)	as	it	energizes	the	various	parts	and	organs
of	the	integrated	collectivity	of	cells—which	we	call	a	body.	The	zodiac	is	thus
seen	as	the	ideal	pattern	and	the	formative	mould	of	every	“body.”

As	a	fact	of	practical	astrological	application	the	zodiac,	as	we	now	use	it	in
the	Western	world,	has	to	be	considered	as	the	“magnetic	field”	of	the	Earth,	this
being	 the	 only	 way	 to	 justify	 our	 astrological	 measurements	 from	 the	 point	 of
view	of	a	heliocentric	scientific	solar	system.	This	is	explained	most	lucidly	in
Alan	Leo’s	Casting	the	Horoscope	from	which	we	shall	quote	the	following:

“The	zodiac	that	we	use	is	really	the	Earth’s	Aura.	It	is	a	sphere	or	ovoid,
the	poles	of	which	coincide	with	the	poles	of	the	Ecliptic	and	its	middle	or
equatorial	plane	is	the	Ecliptic.	.	.	.	For	some	reason	at	present	unexplained,
this	sphere	is	polarised	in	one	direction;	that	is	to	say,	it	remains	always	in
one	position	whatever	the	place	of	the	Earth	in	its	orbit,	in	this	respect	being
comparable	 to	 the	 ordinary	 mariner’s	 compass,	 the	 circular	 card	 of	 which
always	 floats	 with	 its	 North	 Pole	 pointing	 in	 one	 direction.	 This	 sphere	 is
divided	 into	 twelve	 parts	 like	 the	 sections	 of	 an	 orange,	 and	 it	 is	 these
sections	which	constitute	the	“signs”	of	the	zodiac.	We	are,	however,	chiefly
concerned	with	its	equatorial	plane,	for	it	is	this	which	we	measure	in	signs
or	degrees,	and	which	determines	the	zodiacal	position	of	a	planet.

“Now	 it	 is	 clear	 that	 since	 this	 sphere	 or	 aura	 remains	 constantly
‘floating’	 in	 one	 position	 while	 the	 Earth	 journeys	 round	 the	 sun,	 the	 sun’s
rays	will	successively	pass	through	each	one	of	the	signs.	If	you	place	a	lamp
in	 the	 middle	 of	 a	 table,	 and	 walk	 once	 round	 the	 table,	 always	 facing	 one
particular	corner	of	the	room,	the	rays	of	the	light	will	have	shone	upon	each
part	of	the	head	in	turn—the	nose,	left	cheek,	back	of	the	head,	right	cheek,
and	so	on.	.	.	.

“It	need	hardly	be	mentioned	that	this	‘aura’	does	not	turn	round	each	day
with	the	rotation	of	the	earth	on	its	axis,	but	that	the	Earth	spins	round	within
it,	like	the	wheel	in	a	gyroscope.”

In	other	words,	this	“aura”	represents	the	collectivity	of	the	whole	solar	system
in	relation	to	the	Earth.	The	Earth	spins	around	within	it,	just	as	any	individual
moves	 within	 his	 own	 environment,	 which	 environment	 represents	 for	 the

individual	the	collective,	that	is,	the	sum	total	of	relationships	this	individual	can
experience.	 The	 zodiac	 is	 the	 collective	 environment	 of	 the	 Earth,	 and	 thus	 of
mankind	as	a	whole.	All	cosmic	relationships	in	which	the	Earth	can	ever	enter,
all	outside	radiations	which	can	ever	penetrate	the	Earth’s	atmosphere,	and	thus
the	 lungs	 and	 blood	 of	 every	 breathing	 organism	 on	 Earth—all	 must	 pass
through	 the	 zodiac.	 In	 another	 sense,	 then,	 the	 zodiac	 is	 the	 placenta	 of	 the
embryonic	 Earth-body.	 All	 the	 building	 energies	 which	 produce	 the	 growth	 of
the	embryo	must	pass	through	the	placenta.	The	placenta	is	the	formative	zone,
the	 zone	 in	 and	 from	 which	 the	 building	 energies	 and	 substances	 of	 the
macrocosm	 vitalize	 the	 microcosm	 just	 as	 the	 mother’s	 energies	 vitalize	 the
embryo.

As	 the	 solar	 and	 planetary	 rays	 pass	 successively	 through	 each	 one	 of	 the
zodiacal	 signs,	 the	 growing	 microcosm	 accordingly	 receives	 “nourishment”	 or
stimulation—until	 eventually	 it	 reaches	 the	 state	 of	 perfect	 development.	 The
Earth	is	not	perfectly	developed,	neither	is	the	human	race.	So	year	in,	year	out,
the	 Earth,	 the	 human	 race	 and	 all	 other	 life-species	 on	 this	 globe	 receive	 more
“cosmic	 substance,”	 more	 “macrocosmic	 food”—the	 very	 substance	 of	 the
Celestial	 Hierarchies,	 in	 occult	 symbolism;	 the	 celestial	 Bread	 and	 Waters	 of
universal	Life.

The	 reader	 who	 has	 thoroughly	 grasped	 the	 foregoing	 will	 then	 see	 readily
that	it	does	not	in	the	least	matter	whether	the	Earth	is	said	to	revolve	around	the
Sun,	 or	 the	 Sun	 around	 the	 Earth.	 What	 we	 deal	 with	 in	 astrology	 are	 three
factors:	 the	 microcosm,	 the	 macrocosm	 and	 the	 relation	 between	 the	 two.	 This
means,	in	other	words,	the	particular,	the	universal,	and	the	sum	total	of	agencies
by	 means	 of	 which	 the	 universal	 becomes	 focalized	 as	 a	 particular	 organic
whole.	The	sum	total	of	these	agencies	constitutes	the	zodiac.	And	as	far	as	we
men	are	concerned,	the	whole	universe	revolves	around	us,	just	as	the	mother’s
life	revolves	around	the	child.	Egoism?	Not	at	all;	just	common	sense.	Modern
science	 in	 trying	 to	 be	 very	 impersonal	 and	 objective	 does	 not	 yet	 realize	 that,
when	 all	 is	 said	 and	 done,	 it	 is	 impersonal	 and	 objective	 only	 insofar	 as
individual	 human	 beings	 are	 concerned.	 All	 that	 science	 does	 is	 to	 give	 us	 a
knowledge	valid	for	all	men	on	this	Earth.	Philosophically,	nay,	even	practically
speaking,	scientific	knowledge	is	utterly	conditioned	and	limited	by	the	Earth’s
boundaries.	 The	 Earth	 is	 like	 an	 embryo	 within	 the	 placenta.	 The	 embryo	 can
only	 know	 directly	 what	 occurs	 to	 and	 around	 him,	 and	 this	 in	 terms	 of	 life
within	 the	 womb.	 And	 so,	 the	 zodiac	 is	 actually	 what	 the	 theosophists	 call	 the
“Ring-Pass-Not”	of	the	Earth.

In	scientific	terminology	the	viewpoint	and	knowledge	of	all	inhabitants	of
the	Earth	are	absolutely	limited	to	what	occurs	within	the	magnetic	field	of	the
Earth.	 They	 can	 know	 the	 outside	 only	 through	 disturbances	 in	 this	 magnetic
field.	We	know,	of	Sun,	planets	and	 stars,	only	 their	 effects	 upon	 the	 magnetic
field	 of	 the	 Earth.	 We	 have	 absolutely	 no	 way	 of	 knowing	 whether	 the	 rays	 of
the	 stars	 are	 not	 regularly	 deflected	 by	 the	 magnetic	 field	 of	 the	 Earth.	 All	 we
can	 do	 is	 to	 measure	 accurately	 disturbances	 in	 this	 magnetic	 field	 or	 “Earth’s
aura.”	 There	 is	 no	 philosophical	 and	 theoretical	 possibility	 of	 ever	 knowing
directly	what	actually	is	beyond	the	boundaries	of	this	field.	We	can	know	only
“by	 inference.”	 In	 other	 words,	 to	 use	 terms	 which	 the	 new	 school	 of	 idealists
especially	 among	 English	 physicists	 has	 popularized,	 our	 knowledge	 is	 valid
only	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 “intellectual	 frame-work”	 which	 we	 have	 adopted.	 This
“frame-work,”	which	is	perhaps	man’s	greatest	objective	creation,	is	relative	to
man.	 Modern	 science	 acknowledges	 the	 fact	 of	 its	 being	 “man-centered”—an

interpretation	of	collectively	experienced	facts,	collectively	valid	for	mankind	on
Earth.

The	 zodiac	 symbolizes	 the	 frame-work	 to	 which	 every	 astrological
phenomenon	must	be	referred.	It	is	thus	man-centered	and	Earth-centered.	It	is
an	abstraction	and	a	symbol,	just	as	the	Holy	City	with	its	twelve	gates—in	the
Biblical	 allegory—is	 an	 abstraction	 and	 a	 symbol.	 The	 zodiac	 is	 the	 Wall	 that
separates	 all	 inhabitants	 of	 the	 Earth-surface	 from	 the	 universe.	 Symbolically,
this	Wall	has	twelve	gates,	twelve	signs	of	the	zodiac,	twelve	channels	through
which	universal	energies	flow.	We	speak	of	the	“wall”	of	an	atom,	but	mean	only
the	limits	of	a	magnetic	field;	and	we	now	shoot	high-powered	particles	through
this	wall	and	so	release	from	the	atom’s	“Holy	City”	one	or	more	photons.

Why	 do	 we	 speak	 of	 “gates”	 in	 a	 “wall”?	 Why	 not	 an	 open	 field?	 Perhaps
because:	 1)	the	 boundaries	of	a	magnetic	field	differentiate	 sharply	enough	the
inner	 from	 the	 outer	 to	 appear	 as	 a	 solid	 wall—just	 as	 the	 surface	 of	 a	 table
appears	 as	 solid	 as	 a	 wall,	 though	 it	 is	 nothing	 more	 than	 a	 magnetic	 field;	 2)
because	 energy,	 coming	 from	 outside	 in	 and	 going	 from	 inside	 out,	 can	 only
either	enter	or	exit	in	lumps	called	in	modern	physics	“quanta.”	And	it	may	be
that	the	way	these	“quanta”	behave	can	be	accurately,	yet	of	course	symbolically,
expressed	by	the	concept	of	“gates”—which	open	and	close	rhythmically	like	the
valves	of	the	heart.

However	 this	 may	 be,	 the	 fact	 is	 that	 the	 zodiac	 which	 we	 use	 in	 modern
astrology	is	to	be	considered	as	surrounding	the	Earth,	but	not	a	creation	of	the
Earth’s	as	a	rotating	globe.	It	is	the	expression	of	the	relation	Earth-to-universe,
and	 more	 particularly	 Earth-to-Sun.	 This	 is	 made	 evident	 by	 the	 fact	 that	 this
postulated	or	symbolical	sphere	around	the	Earth	is	orientated	to	the	ecliptic	and
the	pole	of	the	ecliptic.	It	does	not	partake	in	the	axial	rotation	of	the	Earth,	or
the	 inclination	 of	 the	 Earth’s	 axis.	 It	 is	 thus	 in	 every	 way	 the	 same	 as	 the
Ptolemaic	zodiac!—only	seen	through	the	spectacles	of	modern	astronomy.	It	is
the	“celestial	sphere”	of	the	astronomers,	but	limited	to	the	neighborhood	of	the
Earth-using	the	term	“neighborhood”	as	in	modern	physics.

Many	astrologers,	however,	often	for	the	sake	of	simplicity,	more	often	still
because	 they	 do	 not	 consider	 attentively	 the	 logical	 foundations	 of	 the	 system
they	use,	refer	to	the	zodiac	as	if	it	were	a	vast	sphere	centered	in	the	Sun	and
encompassing	 the	 entire	 solar	 system.	 Then,	 there	 are	 some	 who	 deliberately
speak	of	it	as	the	“magnetic	field	of	the	Sun.”	There	is,	of	course,	nothing	wrong
with	this	last	idea,	only	it	does	not	correspond	either	with	the	factual,	practical

reality	 or	 with	 the	 philosophical	 idea	 of	 the	 zodiac,	 as	 we	 apply	 the	 term
“zodiac”	today.

The	simplest	illustration	of	this	is	contained	in	the	following	fact:	If	the	signs
of	 the	 zodiac	 are	 a	 twelve-fold	 segmentation	 of	 the	 space	 around	 the	 Sun,	 and
the	Earth	passes	through	one	of	these	segments	each	month	as	it	revolves	around
the	Sun,	then	it	remains	during,	let	us	say,	April	in	the	sign	Libra	(and	the	Sun
appears	 thus	 to	 be	 in	 Aries).	 But	 if	 so,	 the	 Moon	 revolving	 close	 to	 the	 Earth
remains	 in	 this	 sign	 Libra	 about	 as	 long	 as	 the	 Earth	 does,	 that	 is,	 a	 whole
month!	In	other	words,	the	whole	fabric	of	astrology	as	we	use	it	today	falls	very
much	 to	 pieces.	 We	 have	 to	 think	 of	 an	 Earth	 zodiac	 through	 which	 the	 Moon
moves	 (the	 lunar	 zodiac	 of	 the	 past	 perhaps?);	 we	 have	 to	 give	 up	 the	 idea	 of
retrograde	planets.	In	other	words,	we	have	to	have	an	entirely	new	astrological
frame	 of	 reference.	 The	 idea,	 however,	 is	 attractive	 to	 the	 scientific	 type	 of
astrologer.	 From	 our	 standpoint,	 it	 does	 not	 fit	 in	 with	 the	 basic	 principles	 of
astrological	symbolism.	For	it	involves	the	idea	that	we	can	legitimately	imagine
ourselves	 on	 the	 Sun	 and	 that	 we	 can	 interpret	 life	 and	 planetary	 relationships
from	 there.	 To	 us	 this	 is	 not	 philosophically	 acceptable.	 As	 we	 said,	 we	 are
dealing	in	astrology	with	the	interpretation	of	facts	of	experience.	Thus,	as	long
as	 we	 experience	 in	 and	 through	 Earth-born	 and	 Earth-conditioned	 bodies,	 we
cannot	assume	the	imaginary	viewpoint	of	a	being	with	an	actual	Sun-born	and
Sun-conditioned	 body.	 We	 know	 actually	 nothing	 about	 the	 Sun,	 except	 as	 a
center	 of	 radiations	 which	 affects	 us.	 We	 call	 this	 center	 “Sun.”	 And
symbolically	 and	 theoretically	 everything	 works	 as	 if	 the	 Sun	 were	 what	 we
make	 it	 be.	 But	 we	 do	 not	 experience	 the	 Sun	 from	 the	 Sun’s	 viewpoint.	 We
experience	it	only	from	the	Earth’s	viewpoint.	And,	as	already	said,	astrology—
or	any	type	of	life-interpretation—deals	with	experienced	facts	made	significant
We	 are	 not	 in	 this	 contradicting	 previous	 statements.	 We	 can	 well	 accept
modern	 science’s	 interpretation	 of	 the	 relative	 motions	 of	 Sun	 and	 planets,	 yet
take	the	attitude	just	defined.	The	astronomical	concept	of	the	solar	system	is	a
system	of	interpretation	of	observed	facts—a	very	convenient	and	intellectually
wonderful	one.	But	what	count	for	us	are	the	facts.	On	the	basis	of	these	facts,
astronomy	 establishes	 a	 model	 of	 the	 solar	 system.	 On	 the	 basis	 of	 these	 same
facts,	 astrology	 establishes	 a	 symbolism	 of	 life-interpretation.	 Both	 are	 equally
logical.	And	if	the	former	appears	to	work	more	accurately	than	the	latter,	it	is
probably	because	the	latter	deals	with	a	realm	of	being	which	is	more	exact	in
terms	of	significance	than	in	terms	of	events;	a	realm	in	which	the	“principle	of
indeterminacy”	operates	strongly.

### The	Meaning	and	Classification	of	the	Signs	of	the	Zodiac

In	ancient	astrology	based	on	the	Ptolemaic	conception	of	the	universe,	the
houses	 were	 static	 divisions	 of	 the	 space	 above	 and	 below	 the	 flat	 Earth.	 Not
being	an	expression	of	planetary	motion,	they	could	not	be	an	expression	of	Life.
They	dealt	thus	purely	with	outer	circumstances,	establishing	set	departments	for
the	 activities	 of	 Life.	 Therefore	 the	 basis	 of	 all	 classification	 of	 life-operations
was	the	zodiac	and	the	cyclic	course	of	the	Sun	through	its	signs.	The	equinoxes
and	 solstices	 served	 most	 naturally	 to	 effect	 a	 division	 of	 the	 zodiac	 into	 four
great	quarters	corresponding	to	the	seasons.	This	division	is	based	precisely	on
the	relation	of	the	equatorial	plane	of	the	Earth	to	the	ecliptic,	the	apparent	path
of	the	Sun.	Where	these	two	planes	intersect,	there	are	the	equinoxes;	where	they
are	the	farthest	apart,	the	solstices.	This	gives	us	the	four	cardinal	 signs	of	the
zodiac:	 Aries	 and	 Libra,	 at	 the	 equinoxes	 of	 spring	 and	 fall—Cancer	 and
Capricorn,	at	the	solstices	of	summer	and	winter.

These	 four	 signs	 were	 seen	 as	 the	 crucial	 times	 of	 the	 year,	 as	 periods	 of
special	 activity	 of	 the	 life-force	 and	 of	 special	 release	 of	 power.	 It	 was	 clear,
however,	that	the	types	of	release	that	occurred	during	these	four	crucial	periods
were	 of	 different	 natures.	 At	 the	 equinoxes	 came	 the	 times	 of	 greatest
momentum	of	life;	at	the	solstices,	of	least	momentum;	just	as	if	we	watch	the
oscillations	of	a	pendulum	we	see	its	motion	being	the	fastest	when	it	crosses	the
point	of	equilibrium,	and	the	slowest	when	it	reaches	its	end-positions.

For	the	ancients,	the	ecliptic	appeared	to	oscillate	southward	and	northward
in	relation	to	the	Earth,	completing	a	full	oscillation	every	year.	For	us	moderns,
it	is	the	poles	of	the	Earth	which	perform	the	oscillating	motion	with	regard	to
the	 Sun,	 turning	 themselves	 to	 and	 away	 from	 the	 Sun.	 When	 the	 North	 Pole
places	 itself	 face	 to	 face	 with	 the	 Sun,	 this	 is	 summer	 in	 the	 northern
hemisphere;	when	it	hides	its	face	from	the	Sun,	it	is	winter.	The	same	pendular
oscillation,	but	seen	either	from	the	point	of	view	of	the	equator-ecliptic	relation,
or	from	that	of	the	pole-Sun	relation.

The	result,	in	both	cases,	is	that	the	equinoctial	signs	of	the	zodiac,	Aries	and
Libra,	are	signs	of	great	positive	momentum;	whereas	the	solsticial	signs,	Cancer
and	 Capricorn,	 are	 signs	 of	 negative	 momentum.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 at	 the
solsticial	 points	 the	 polarities	 of	 life	 (the	 Yang	and	Yin	 of	 Chinese	 philosophy)
are	to	be	experienced	respectively	in	their	purest	quality.	The	purest	Yang	(with
the	least	admixture	of	Yin)	is	 experienced	 by	 the	 Earth	 at	 the	 summer	 solstice;
the	purest	Yin	(with	the	least	admixture	of	Yang)	is	experienced	by	the	Earth	at

the	winter	solstice;	while	at	the	equinoxes	the	two	polarities	are	equally	blended.
Thus	we	have	two	sets	of	factors.	At	the	equinoxes	the	momentum	of	life	is
greatest.	At	the	solstices	the	qualities	of	the	polarities	of	life	are	to	be	felt	in	the
purest	way.	This	gives	us	the	meaning	of	the	characterization	of	the	four	crucial
periods	of	the	year	in	terms	of	four	“elements”:	Fire	and	Air,	Water	and	Earth.
Fire	(Aries)	and	Air	(Libra)	are	expressions	of	momentum;	Water	(Cancer)	and
Earth	(Capricorn)	are	expressions	of	life-qualities,	or	polarities.	At	the	equinoxes
we	have	extremes	of	motion	and	activity	(either	toward	or	away	from	the	Sun,
positive	or	negative	in	direction);	at	the	solstices	we	find	potentially	extremes	of
realization	(either	of	the	Yang	or	the	Yin	polarities).

The	terms	Yang	and	Yin	must,	however,	not	confuse	us.	They	really	mean	in
this	respect	objective	and	subjective,	outer	and	inner;	thus,	according	to	ancient
customs	they	referred	to	man	and	woman.	From	Aries	to	Libra:	this	is	the	period
of	 living	 objectively,	 the	 period	 when	 vegetation	 is	 manifest.	 It	 is	 the	 realm	 of
leaf.	 From	 Libra	 to	 Aries:	 this	 is	 the	 period	 of	 living	 subjectively,	 the	 period
when	vegetation	is	latent,	hidden	below	the	crust	of	the	earth.	It	is	the	realm	of
seed.	Leaf	and	seed	are	two	great	symbols	of	outer	and	inner,	of	objectivity	and
subjectivity.

Aries	 represents,	 therefore,	 the	 extreme	 of	 momentum	 toward	 the	 leaf-
condition,	 toward	 the	 extreme	 of	 realization	 in	 and	 through	 objective	 reality,
which	is	Cancer—the	plant	fulfilled	in	the	fruit:	objective	maturity.

Libra,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 represents	 the	 extreme	 of	 momentum	 toward	 the
seed-condition,	 toward	 the	 extreme	 of	 realization	 in	 and	 through	 subjective
reality,	 which	 is	 Capricorn—the	 birth	 of	 the	 Christ-consciousness	 within:
subjective	maturity.

Thus	Fire	(Aries)	is	motion	toward	objective	manifestation:	—the	primordial
desire	for	manifestation,	the	thirst	for	life	in	a	body:	Tanha—the	will	to	live	as	a
separate	self—in	Buddhistic	philosophy.	Fire	is	fulfilled	in	Water	(Cancer):	the
urge-to-be	 is	 fulfilled	 in	 the	 sap	 of	 plants,	 the	 lymph	 and	 milk	 that	 sustain	 all
animal	life;	the	personal	soul	also.

Air	 (Libra)	 is	 motion	 toward	 subjective	 realization—the	 yearning	 for	 the
God-within,	 the	 thirst	 for	 “Liberation”	 or	 for	 Nirvana.	 Liberation	 from	 what?
From	the	bondage	to	the	body	and	to	separate	selfhood.	It	is	motion	away	from
the	physical	sun	and	toward	the	beyond.	Air	is	fulfilled	in	Earth	(Capricorn):	The
longing	for	God	is	satisfied	in	the	birth	of	the	Christ-body	within—	the	spiritual
Earth,	the	New	Jerusalem.

### In	terms	of	our	previous	nomenclature—individual,	collective	and	creative—

### we	have	the	following	diagram:

This	 might	 seem	 to	 conflict	 with	 what	 we	 said	 of	 the	 zodiac	 referring	 as	 a
whole	 to	 the	 collective.	 But	 we	 must	 realize	 that	 individual	 and	 collective	 are
purely	relative	terms.	The	body	is	“collective”	to	the	individual	self;	yet	it	is	a
whole,	 therefore	 an	 individual	 organism.	 When	 we	 speak	 thus	 of	 “individual”
with	 reference	 to	 the	 zodiac,	 we	 speak	 of	 these	 cosmic	 energies	 which	 are
building	 the	 wholeness	 of	 any	 whole.	 Wholeness	 and	 individual	 selfhood	 are
almost	synonymous—the	same	fact	looked	at	from	two	different	points	of	view.

Fire	 is	 individual,	 because	 it	 is	 the	 animating	 principle	 of	 all	 individual
selfhood.	It	is	that	which	rises	out	of	the	Earth	toward	the	Sun.	It	is	the	fire	of
germination	that	propels	the	nucleus	of	the	seed	Sunward,	toward	the	God-that-
is-everywhere.

Air	is	“collective,”	because	it	is	that	which	brings	every	separate	individual
and	body	into	the	subtle	communion	of	the	breath.	Air	links	the	lungs	and	blood
of	every	breathing	entity.	It	is	that	which	rises	out	of	the	Water	toward	the	all-
encompassing	Space.	It	is	the	emanation	of	all	bodies,	the	perfume	of	all	lives.
In	and	through	it,	all	lives	reach	unity	in	the	all-embracing	seed	that	is	the	God-
of-the-Mystery:	SPACE.

Water	is	the	“creative”	manifestation	of	the	urge	to	be	a	separate	individual.
Earth	 is	 the	 “creative”	 manifestation	 of	 the	 urge	 to	 reach	 a	 stage	 of	 absolute

spiritual	solidarity.	 Solidarity	 is	 to	 the	 spirit	 what	 solidity	 is	 to	 matter.	 In	 both
cases	it	means	Earth.	Within	the	scope	of	the	life	of	a	particular	man,	solidarity
has	 to	 be	 established	 between	 all	 organic	 and	 magnetic	 life-centers	 before	 the
Christ-body	takes	form—a	symbol	or	sign	of	this	perfect	solidarity.

The	reader	may	be	puzzled	by	the	manner	in	which	we	make	the	opposition
individual-collective	 coincide	 with	 the	 equinoxes,	 whereas	 we	 found	 the
opposition	 Yang-Yin	 coinciding	 with	 the	 solstices.	 The	 contradiction	 is	 more
apparent	 than	 real.	 The	 Chinese	 duality	 of	 principles	 or	 polarities	 referred	 to
concrete	 facts,	 whereas	 we	 are	 dealing,	 when	 speaking	 of	 individual	 and
collective,	with	principles	of	motion,	or	let	us	say,	with	trends	of	consciousness.
In	 other	 words,	 we	 place	 ourselves	 at	 an	 abstract	 level,	 which,	 obviously,
changes	 our	 focalization.	 Practically	 speaking,	 there	 is	 very	 little	 difference.
Cancer	 traditionally	 rules	 the	 “home”	 and	 Capricorn,	 the	 “public	 life”	 or
“profession”—truly	 the	 sphere	 of	 individual	 creativeness	 and	 that	 of	 collective
creativeness.

Much	confusion	occurs	in	the	application	of	astrological	symbolism	because
the	various	points	of	view	of	interpretation	are	not	clearly	enough	differentiated.
When	the	ordinary	text-book	lists	all	the	things	Cancer	is	supposed	to	represent,
it	 is,	 in	 fact,	 piling	 up	 a	 mass	 of	 “meanings”	 which	 are	 the	 results	 of	 several
types	of	interpretation.	Cancer	means	one	thing	from	one	point	of	view,	another
thing	 from	 another	 point	 of	 view.	 This	 fact	 justifies	 our	 present	 attitude	 which
aims	 at	 a	 clarification	 and	 classification	 of	 meanings.	 One	 may	 try	 to	 interpret
the	signs	of	the	zodiac	from	several	points	of	view,	each	giving	a	particular	set	of
meanings;	but,	unless	one	realizes	the	way	each	set	is	produced	and	the	logic	of
its	production,	much	confusion	is	bound	to	ensue.

So	 far,	 we	 have	 dealt	 with	 the	 most	 general	 and	 archetypal	 foundation	 of
zodiacal	 interpretation,	 considering	 the	 four	 basic	 moments	 of	 the	 cycle	 of	 the
year.	It	is	evident	that	further	differentiation	is	advisable,	in	fact	necessary,	and
there	are	two	essential	ways	in	which	this	can	be	done.	The	four-fold	structure	of
“cardinal”	 signs	 (Aries-Libra;	 Cancer-Capricorn)	 gives	 us	 four	 sections	 of	 90
degrees	 each.	 Each	 section	 can	 be	 divided	 into	 two	 subsections	 of	 45	 degrees
each;	 or	 into	 three	 sub-sections	 of	 30	 degrees	 each.	 The	 latter	 procedure	 is	 the
usual	 one;	 but	 it	 loses	 much	 of	 its	 meaning	 when	 it	 is	 not	 correlated	 with	 the
former,	which,	unfortunately,	is	very	little	understood.

Energy-differentiation:	 The	 four-fold	 division	 of	 the	 zodiac	 which	 we	 have
studied	 so	 far	 gives	 us	 four	 basic	 types	 of	 cosmic	 substance:	 Fire-Air;	 Water-

Earth.	 This	 is	 the	 most	 fundamental	 zodiacal	 differentiation	 inasmuch	 as	 the
zodiac	 as	 a	 whole	 symbolizes,	 as	 already	 said,	 the	 building	 of	 a	 microcosm.
Substance	 is	 the	 most	 fundamental	 thing	 in	 any	 building.	 But	 “energy”	 and
“form”	 are	 just	 as	 important.	 Therefore	 we	 shall	 see	 that	 the	 zodiac	 is,	 most
logically,	susceptible	of	two	other	types	of	differentiation,	referring	respectively
to	energy	and	form.

Energy	 is	 not	 very	 different	 from	 substance.	 It	 is	 substance	 activated	 and
released,	as	modern	physics	has	shown	most	definitely.	Thus	we	can	expect	the
principle	 of	 “energy-differentiation”	 to	 be	 similar	 to	 that	 of	 “substance-
differentiation.”	Both	are	based	on	the	principle	of	polar	dualism;	of	action	and
reaction.	The	energy-zodiac	will	thus	be	eight-fold,	while	the	substance-zodiac	is
fourfold.

### According	to	T.	O.	McGrath	(Timing	Business	Activity	and	the	Sun,	p.	12):

“It	is	known	that	all	bodies	such	as	the	sun	and	its	satellites	are	charged
bodies	and	are	surrounded	by	a	magnetic	field;—	that	in	any	magnetic	body
having	 two	 poles	 (the	 sun	 and	 its	 satellites	 are	 such	 bodies),	 the	 magnetic
currents	circulate	from	the	north	to	the	south	pole,	become	neutral	at	each	90
degrees,	and	reach	a	maximum	intensity	at	each	45	degrees.”

If	such	is	the	case,	it	is	evident	that	the	points	of	maximum	release	of	energy
are	to	be	found	mid-way	between	equinoxes	and	solstices.	These	points	are	thus
on	the	following	degrees	of	the	circle:	45-135-225-315;	or	in	terms	of	the	usual
zodiacal	 nomenclature:	 Taurus	 15;	 Leo	 15;	 Scorpio	 15;	 Aquarius	 15.	 These
points	 are	 not	 unknown	 to	 some	 occultists.	 They	 correspond	 to	 what	 has	 been
called:	 the	 Four	 Gates	 of	 Avataric	 Descent.	 As	 an	 “Avatar”	 in	 ancient
terminology	is	in	fact	a	 release	of	cosmic	energy,	the	 meaning	 of	 the	 phrase	 is
quite	evident.	These	Four	Gates	are	symbolized	by	the	four	symbolic	creatures:
the	 Bull—the	 Lion—the	 Eagle—the	 Angel.	 Each	 of	 them	 depicts	 a	 particular
type	 of	 dynamic	 release,	 a	 particular	 type	 or	 Ray	 of	 Power—and	 of	 power-
releasing	“initiation.”

The	 Bull	 and	 the	 Lion	 represent	 individuating	 power,	 power	 rooted	 in	 the
planet,	 i.e.,	 in	 concrete	 selfhood.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 Eagle	 and	 the	 Angel
symbolize	 collectivating	 power;	 power	 that	 expands	 the	 individual	 into	 the
collective	 and	 the	 universal.	 We	 might	 add	 that	 the	 Bull	 is	 power	 toward	 the
formation	of	the	individual	being,	while	the	Lion	is	power	emanating	from	the
individual	 being.	 The	 Eagle	 is	 power	 toward	 the	 formation	 of	 the	 universal
being,	while	the	Angel	is	power	emanating	from	the	universal	being.

In	 the	 cycle	 of	 the	 year	 the	 four	 “avataric”	 points	 occur	 approximately	 on
May	 6;	 August	 8;	 November	 8;	 February	 5.	 At	 these	 times	 the	 energies	 or
realizations	which	were	gathered	in	at	equinoxes	and	solstices	are	released	and
made	 effective.	 It	 might	 interest	 the	 numerologist	 to	 consider	 the	 fact	 that	 the
figures	 in	 the	 number	 of	 each	 of	 these	 eight	 points	 of	 the	 circle	 add	 up	 to	 the

digit	9:	(45,	90,	135,	etc.).	Baha’u’llah,	the	great	Persian	prophet,	whom	many
consider	 as	 the	 Avatar	 of	 the	 new	 Aquarian	 Age,	 was	 born	 on	 November	 12,
very	 close	 to	 the	 Eagle-point—a	 very	 fitting	 time	 for	 one	 who	 preached	 the
gospel	 of	 a	 “universal	 religion,”	 and	 in	 general	 of	 an	 all-inclusive	 planetary
synthesis.	He	took	the	number	9	as	the	symbol	of	his	message.

Form	 differentiation:	 Energy	 operates	 on	 a	 polar	 rhythm	 of	 action	 and
reaction;	thus	any	type	of	energy-differentiation	is	based	on	 theoretically	equal
divisions	and	sub-divisions:	2	—	4	—	8.	In	ancient	symbology	8	is	the	number
of	 the	 Sun;	 888,	 the	 number	 of	 the	 Christ,	 the	 triune	 Sun.	 The	 number	 9	 thus
represents	 Him	 who	 wields	 the	 8-fold	 power.	 But	 how	 is	 one	 to	 wield	 power,
unless	one	has	a	form-of-power—an	engine—in	which	to	hold	and	from	which
to	release	power	at	will?	We	cannot	go	fully	into	a	discussion	of	the	meaning	of
the	term	“form-of-power.”*	Suffice	it	to	say	that	there	can	be	no	controlled	and
rhythmical	release	of	energy	unless	there	is	some	sort	of	“engine”	through	which
this	 release	 is	 effected.	 All	 engines	 are	 “forms-of-power;”	 that	 is,	 forms	 which
control	the	generation,	concentration	and	distribution	of	power.

Three	 operations	 always:	 generation,	 concentration	 and	 distribution.
Therefore	the	basic	number	of	all	forms-of-power	(and	we	probably	could	say	of
all	types	of	engineering)	is	3.	The	engineer	uses	push	and	pull.	Push	and	pull	are
two	things;	but	“uses”	involves	a	third	principle.	Action	and	reaction:	such	is	the
pure	energy-rhythm.	But	a	third	term	is	necessary:	interaction,	if	the	energy	is	to
build	an	organic	body.	A	body	is	not	a	pipe	through	which	tides	of	energy	have
their	ebb	and	flow.	It	assimilates	substance.	It	holds	energy.	It	transforms	power.
It	uses	ebb	and	flow	to	step	up	the	level	or	potential	of	the	energy.	And	this	is
“organic	living”—which	always	involves	three	basic	faculties:	self-maintenance,
self-reproduction,	self-realization.

We	could	go	on	almost	indefinitely	enumerating	trinities	of	principles	in	all
realms	 of	 being	 and	 becoming.	 But	 here,	 with	 the	 zodiac	 and	 with	 all
“equatorial”	elements,	we	deal	mainly	with	power—with	the	power	that	builds
and	 regenerates	 organisms	 or	 bodies.	 And	 the	 most	 satisfactory	 formulation	 of
the	trinity	of	elements	which	enters	in	this	building	operation	is	the	one	already
mentioned:	generation,	concentration	and	distribution.

We	 saw	 that	 at	 the	 four	 crucial	 points	 of	 the	 year’s	 cycle	 there	 was	 a
generation	 of	 power.	 The	 results	 of	 this	 generation	 are	 four	 basic	 types	 of
“substances”:	Fire-Air,	Water-Earth.	Through	these	four	“substances”	or	cosmic
elements	 power	 will	 operate	 according	 to	 the	 triple	 rhythm	 above	 mentioned.

### This	will	give	us	the	following	scheme	of	operation:

Zodiacal	signs	of	generation	of	power	are	called:	Cardinal	signs.
Zodiacal	signs	of	concentration	of	power	are	called:	Fixed	signs.
Zodiacal	signs	of	distribution	of	power	are	called:	Mutable	signs.
They	 can	 be	 referred	 respectively	 to	 spirit,	 soul	 and	 mind—all	 three
operating	 within	 the	 total	 “body”	 or	 “auric	 egg”:	 the	 microcosm.	 This
microcosm	can	also	be	called,	using	the	term	in	its	most	inclusive	significance:
personality.	 Personality,	 or	 perhaps,	 better	 still,	 the	 Living	 Person,	 is	 the
synthesis	 of	 spirit,	 soul	 and	 mind	 operating	 within	 a	 body	 (or	 bodies,	 if	 one
accepts	 the	 occult	 concept	 of	 several	 distinct	 vehicles	 for	 spiritual,	 animic	 and
mental	energies	centered	around	the	visible	physical	structure).

Spirit—or	Life—generates.	Soul	concentrates.	 Mind	 distributes.	Personality
manifests—or	hides!	The	work	of	life-development	for	every	human	being	is	to
reveal	in	the	operation	of	personality	the	generations	of	spirit,	the	concentrations
of	soul	and	the	distributions	of	mind.

### In	order	to	make	the	symbolical	picture	complete	we	have	only	to	relate	the

four-fold	and	the	three-fold	classification.	We	shall	then	try	to	understand	how:

### This	may	seem	rather	involved	and	disconcerting;	and	so	we	may	try	another

### way	of	stating	the	zodiacal	“formula:”

Spirit-Fire	(Aries)	is	generative	Fire:	Electric	Fire.
Soul-Fire	(Leo)	is	concentrative	Fire:	Solar	Fire.
Mind-Fire	(Sagittarius)	is	distributive	Fire:	Fire	by	friction.

### This	means	that:

When	Fire	generates	it	is	operating	in	terms	of	spirit.
When	Fire	concentrates	it	is	operating	in	terms	of	soul.
When	Fire	distributes	it	is	operating	in	terms	of	mind.

### In	other	words:

Generative	Fire	is	the	starting-point	of	individual	selfhood	(Aries).
Concentrative	 Fire	refers	 to	the	 creative	 release	of	 self,	by	means	of	which

the	soul	knows	itself	whole	and	god-like	(Leo).

Distributive	 Fire	 is	 that	 fire	 which	 blends,	 synthetizes	 and	 universalizes	 all
elements	and	energies	prior	to	the	Christ-birth—the	birth	of	the	universal	being
(Sagittarius)	.*

The	 same	 procedure	 will	 bring	 out	 more	 clearly	 the	 significance	 of	 the	 other
elements:

Generative	 Water	 (Cancer)	 operates	 in	 terms	 of	 spirit.	 It	 is	 the	 power	 that
gives	 birth	 to	 concrete	 selfhood,	 that	 creates	 a	 concrete	 basis	 of	 operation—a
home—for	the	individual	self.

### Concentrative	Water	(Scorpio)	operates	in	terms	of	soul.	It	concentrates	and

sustains	the	collectivating	urge	of	spirit-Air	(Libra),	the	impulse	toward	“re-birth
in	Christ.”

Distributive	Water	(Pisces)	operates	in	terms	of	mind.	It	effects	the	synthesis
of	energies	that	were	brought	to	creative	focalization	in	Capricorn,	and	vitalized
in	Aquarius.

Generative	Air	(Libra)	operates	in	terms	of	spirit.	It	is	the	power	that	gathers

and	communalizes	the	emanations	of	individuals.

Concentrative	Air	(Aquarius)	operates	in	terms	of	soul.	It	gives	vitality	and
momentum	 to	 the	 spiritual	 Earth	 (Capricorn).	 It	 is	 the	 breath	 of	 the	 collective
soul.

Distributive	 Air	 (Gemini)	 operates	 in	 terms	 of	 mind.	 It	 exteriorizes	 and
interprets	 the	 individual	 impulsion	 of	 Aries,	 once	 focalized	 and	 insubstantiated
in	Taurus.

Generative	 Earth	 (Capricorn)	 operates	 in	 terms	 of	 spirit.	 It	 is	 the	 power	 of
incarnation,	 the	 power	 to	 assume	 a	 body—from	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the
involving	spirit.

Concentrative	 Earth	 (Taurus)	 operates	 in	 terms	 of	 soul.	 It	 gives	 substance

and	depth	to	the	Aries	impulses.

Distributive	Earth	(Virgo)	operates	in	terms	of	mind.	It	spreads	the	creative
release	of	self	of	Leo	through	space,	where	it	is	seen	as	a	mass	of	polar	energies
(The	Virgin	of	Light).	Discrimination	is	aroused	in	the	mind	as	the	problem	of
dealing	with	polarities,	with	light	and	shade,	arises.

From	this,	we	can	see	how	each	cosmic	element	is	susceptible	of	assuming
three	distinct	functions,	somewhat	as	a	man	can	act,	feel	and	think	at	the	same
time:	1)	as	a	father	to	his	son;	2)	as	a	husband	to	his	wife;	3)	as	a	comrade	and
co-worker	 with	 his	 associates	 and	 friends,	 thus	 (roughly	 speaking)	 generating,
concentrating	and	distributing	the	energies	of	his	own	being.

### The	Zodiac	as	the	Cycle	of	the	Planetary	Individual

So	far	we	have	considered	zodiacal	signs	mostly	from	the	point	of	view	of
their	 being	 a	 series	 of	 cosmic	 energies	 projected	 as	 it	 were	 by	 the	 Macrocosm
(the	 Twelve	 Hierarchies)	 upon	 the	 microcosm;	 in	 other	 words	 as	 a	 series	 of
formative	 operations,	 or	 phases	 of	 the	 building	 of	 this	 microcosm.	 This	 is	 the
equatorial-collective	viewpoint.	But	we	can	also	think	of	the	zodiac	as	the	cycle

of	 houses	 of	 the	 planetary	 Individual	 Who	 “dwells	 at	 the	 North	 Pole,”	 and	 for
Whom	 a	 year	 is	 as	 a	 day,	 with	 six	 months	 of	 sunlight	 (Aries	 to	 Libra)	 and	 six
months	of	darkness	(Libra	to	Aries),	at	least	theoretically	speaking.	From	such	a
standpoint	the	zodiac	becomes	interpreted	in	terms	of	consciousness	rather	than
in	terms	of	energy.

Such	a	consciousness-interpretation	is	most	valuable,	as	it	brings	the	signs	of
the	zodiac	in	relation	to	the	houses,	and	thus	an	interpenetration	of	meanings	is
shown	 which	 helps	 one	 to	 understand	 much	 of	 the	 confused	 traditional
statements	 as	 to	 the	 significance	 of	 both	 houses	 and	 signs.	 Besides,	 a	 sort	 of
algebraic	 formula	 is	 thus	 evolved	 which	 can	 easily	 be	 shown	 to	 be	 the
substructure	 underneath	 all	 dramatic	 and	 mythological	 interpretations	 of	 the
zodiac	 known	 to	 students	 of	 astrology	 and	 occultism.	 The	 most	 remarkable	 of
these	 interpretations	 is	 undoubtedly	 the	 one	 detailed	 in	 Sampson’s	 book	 The
Zodiac.	Alice	 Bailey	 gave	 another	 traditional	 interpretation	 when	 relating,	 in	 a
series	 of	 lectures,	 the	 story	 of	 the	 Twelve	 Labors	 of	 Hercules.	 Hercules	 is	 the
Sun,	and	his	Twelve	Labors	are	the	twelve	cosmic	operations	of	the	zodiac	seen
from	a	regenerative,	rather	than	a	formative,	standpoint.

In	 ordinary	 astrological	 works	 the	 zodiacal	 signs	 are	 presented	 as	 the	 basic
factors	 of	 significance,	 and	 the	 houses	 model	 their	 meanings	 after	 them.	 But
from	 our	 standpoint	 we	 find	 in	 the	 twelve-fold	 pattern	 of	 the	 dial	 of	 houses	 a
basic	formula	of	individual	unfoldment;	and	it	is	this	pattern—a	purely	abstract
one	 —which	 establishes	 the	 most	 universal	 series	 of	 meanings.	 It	 is	 of	 course
purely	 a	 numerological	 pattern	 dealing	 with	 the	 significance	 of	 the	 numbers
from	1	to	12	inclusive;	but	the	numbers	are	made	significant	by	being	projected,
as	 it	 were,	 geometrically.	 This	 projection	 is	 the	 wheel	 or	 dial	 of	 houses.	 Aries
becomes	 thus	 significant	 because	 of	 being	 an	 equatorial-organic	 projection	 of
No.	1;	Taurus,	of	No.	2,	etc.,	up	to	Pisces,	as	No.	12.	The	axis	1-6	represents	the
dualism	of	self	and	not-self,	of	“I	and	Thou.”	The	axis	4-7	represents	the	dualism
of	experience:	subjective	experience	and	objective	experience—or	of	private	and
public	behavior.	We	hope	that	the	following	table	will	make	the	matter	clear.	It
should	 be	 studied	 in	 connection	 with	 the	 table	 of	 meanings	 of	 houses	 on	 page
### 181.	Modern	astrological	text-books,	such	as	those	written	by	Alan	Leo,	C.	E.	O.
Carter,*	 A.	 G.	 Libra,	 Parker,	 etc.,	 are	 full	 of	 valuable	 added	 references	 to	 the
meaning	of	the	signs	of	the	zodiac,	singly	and	in	groups.	As	Carter	writes:

“The	task	of	interpreting	the	zodiacal	script	has	been	attempted	by	many
writers,	 each	 approaching	 the	 work	 from	 his	 own	 standpoint.	 It	 is	 far	 from

my	desire	even	tacitly	to	differ	from	their	conclusions	or	to	seek	to	supersede
anything	written	before.	The	contents	of	the	Circle	of	Zodiacal	Wisdom	are
inexhaustible,	and	present	all-various	aspects	of	the	integrality	of	Truth.”

The	Zodiac	and	the	Soul,	p.	14.

The	 last	 sentence	 of	 this	 quotation	 gives	 us	 the	 clue	 to	 much	 that	 could	 be
developed	 at	 length;	 especially	 the	 term	 “contents.”	 The	 zodiac	 represents,	 we
said,	the	element	of	“substance	“	But	substance	means	also	contents.	The	zodiac
gives	us	a	knowledge	of	the	life-contents	of	every	living	entity.	The	houses	tell
us	the	manner	in	which	these	contents	are	distributed	in	a	form	of	selfhood	and
destiny.	 The	 Planets	 are	 focal	 points	 for	 and	 symbols	 of	 all	 life-activities.	 The
Degrees	give	us	a	clue	to	the	inherent	creative	significance	of	all	activities	and
all	focalizations.

## PLANETS	AND	PERSONALITY

We	defined	“personality”	as	“a	synthesis	of	patterns	of	behavior;	as	the	sum	total
of	all	the	outer	motions	and	emotions	of	the	human	being:	the	total	rhythm	of	his
life-operations—from	the	way	he	walks	and	twitches	his	lips	to	his	behavior	on
the	battlefield	or	on	a	concert	platform,”	We	said	that,	as	without	activity	there
could	 be	 no	 “personality,”	 we	 can	 speak	 of	 it	 as	 a	 complex	 of	 activities.	 Such
statements	 are	 sufficient	 proof	 that	 we	 do	 not	 give	 to	 the	 term	 the	 rather
pejorative	 meaning	 which	 theosophists	 and	 students	 of	 esoteric	 philosophy
ordinarily	affix	to	it.

We	 do	 not	 consider	 personality	 as	 representing	 the	 “outer”	 being	 in
contradistinction	to	the	so-called	individuality	or	“inner”	being.	We	feel	that	this
opposition	 or	 dualism	 is	 not	 particularly	 fruitful	 at	 our	 present	 stage	 of	 human
development.	Rather,	it	tends	to	focalize	human	behavior	in	a	way	which	is	more
devotional-ethical	than	integrative	and	esthetical—the	latter	term	being	used	as
previously	defined.	Personality,	to	us	and	presumably	to	men	like	General	Smuts
and	most	modern	psychologists,	is	the	whole	human	being	in	operation.	It	is	not
the	whole	human	being	in	essence	or	abstractly,	but	in	actual	manifestation	and
to	 the	 extent	 to	 which	 it	 is	 perceptible	 to	 other	 personalities	 functioning	 at	the
same	level	of	operation.

No	 astrologer—and	 as	 well	 no	 psychoanalyst—can	 interpret	 a	 life	 and
destiny	 at	 a	 level	 higher	 than	 that	 at	 which	 he	 himself	 functions.	 A	 narrow-
minded	clerk	in	a	small	town	office	cannot	know	the	personality	of	a	great	saint
or	genius	as	it	is.	He	will,	of	course,	pass	judgment	upon	it	or	possibly	worship
it,	but	he	is	not	in	a	position	to	know	it	and	to	evaluate	it	as	a	personality-even
though	 he	 may	 react	 most	 sharply	 to	 some	 features	 of	 it.	 Personality	 signifies
wholeness	 in	 actu.	 And	 there	 is	 no	 real	 perception,	 or	 at	 any	 rate	 no
is
understanding,	 of	 personality	 unless
apprehended,	 consciously	 or	 through	 intuitive	 feelings.	 And	 no	 one	 can

apprehend	this	totality	unless	he	be	at	the	same	level	of	human	development,	or,
if	at	a	higher	level,	to	be	still	able	to	put	himself	temporarily	at	the	lower	level.

These	remarks	are	necessary,	because	people	often	speak	of	personality	as	if
it	were	an	absolutely	obvious	thing	similarly	apprehended	by	everyone.	Reacting
to	 some	phases	of	a	personality,	and	understanding	or	even	being	aware	of	the
reality—that	is,	of	the	human	wholeness,	which	is	the	personality	itself—are	two
very	different	operations.	Personality,	as	a	synthesis	of	patterns	of	behavior,	may
encompass	 many	 phases	 of	 activities	 most	 difficult	 to	 apprehend.	 We	 are	 not
referring	 here	 to	 an	 exaggerated	 dédoublement	 of	 personality	 which	 produces
two	 absolutely	 distinct	 types	 of	 behavior	 in	 relation	 to	 one	 physical	 organism,
but	 merely	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 personality	 may	 involve	 series	 of	 activities	 which
transcend	 the	 normal	 conscious	 development	 of	 mankind	 as	 it	 is	 today.
Personality	 is	 a	 “balance-sheet”	 showing	 the	 ever-changing	 relationship	 of
conscious	 to	 unconscious,	 individual	 to	 collective	 factors,	 in	 the	 whole	 human
being.	 Men	 whose	 inner	 beings	 are	 flooded	 with	 projections	 from	 the	 deeper
layers	of	the	“collective	unconscious”	are,	as	personalities,	complex	and	hard	to
fathom.	 Only	 their	 peers	 can	 know	 them,	 can	 know	 the	 total	 pattern	 of	 their
behavior	 at	 all	 levels.	 For,	 as	 Walt	 Whitman	 wrote,	 with	 cryptic	 beauty	 of
utterance:

“Only	themselves	understand	themselves	and	the	like	of	themselves,
And	souls	only	understand	souls.”

Undoubtedly	 one	 of	 the	 greatest	 achievements	 of	 astrological	 technique	 is
the	 power	 one	 acquires,	 through	 mastering	 it,	 to	 see	 in	 a	 birth-chart	 the	 blue-
print	 of	 a	 total	 personality.	 We	 have	 already	 seen	 how	 one	 can	 isolate	 and
interpret	 the	 individual	 and	 collective	 factors	 which	 constitute,	 as	 it	 were,	 the
warp	 and	 woof	 of	 personality.	 But	 the	 pattern	 of	 the	 tapestry	 is	 to	 be
apprehended	only	by	studying	those	astrological	entities	which	are	foci	of	color,
foci	 of	 activity,	 foci	 of	 significance.	 These	 entities,	 considered	 in	 their	 infinite
correlations	 and	 not	 as	 isolated	 dots,	 make	 all	 together	 the	 design	 of	 the	 life-
tapestry.	 They	 reveal	 the	 personality	 as	 a	 pattern	 of	 multifarious	 behavior,
symbolizing	from	the	most	matter	of	fact	to	the	most	exalted	or	transcendental
modes	of	physio-psychological	activity.

These	 astrological	 entities	 come	 under	 two	 general	 categories.	 First,	 the
planets	 themselves,	 including	 Sun	 and	 Moon;	 second,	 abstract	 points	 derived
from	 the	 relationships	 between	 either	 the	 orbits	 of	 the	 planets	 (nodes)	 or	 the

positions	 of	 said	 planets	 in	 reference	 to	 horizon	 and	 meridian	 (parts).	 This
chapter	will	be	devoted	to	a	brief	analysis	of	the	basic	significance	of	planets	in
terms	of	personality-analysis;	the	next,	to	a	study	of	the	nodes	and	of	the	most
important	among	the	parts.

We	 shall,	 however,	 once	 more	 have	 to	 divide	 our	 field	 of	 study,	 and	 to
classify	 the	 planets	 in	 at	 least	 two	 essential	 manners.	 The	 first	 type	 of
classification	 deals	 with	 the	 motivating	 power	 and	 the	 source	 of	 the	 activities
symbolized	by	the	planets.	We	shall	distinguish	between	planets	referring	to	the
conscious	and	planets	referring	to	the	unconscious—using	the	terms	“conscious”
and	“unconscious”	as	used	by	C.	G.	Jung,	and	as	defined	in	a	previous	chapter
(Cf.	 p.	 85,	 Astrology	 and	 Analytical	 Psychology).	 Outside	 of	 these	 two
categories	we	shall	place	the	Sun	as	the	symbol	of	the	integrating	energies	of	the
Self,	which	is	described	by	Jung	as	the	“center	of	the	totality	of	the	psyche.”	The
psyche	 includes	 both	 unconscious	 and	 conscious	 contents.	 To	 integrate	 these
contents—that	is,	consciously	to	assimilate	the	contents	of	the	unconscious—is
the	 essence	 of	 the	 process	 of	 individuation,	 of	 which	 the	 Sun	 is	 the	 active
symbol.

### The	Sun	as	Integrator

Astrology,	 being	 a	 system	 of	 symbolic	 interpretation	 of	 significant
astronomical	 facts,	 must	 obviously	 differentiate	 strongly	 between	 the	 Sun—a
life-and	light-giving	star	which	is	the	center	of	the	astronomical	system	to	which
we	belong—and	planets	which	are	merely	reflectors	or	transmitters	of	light,	and
of	 which	 the	 Earth	 itself	 is	 one.	 If	 we	 refer	 to	 the	 ego	 as	 “a	 complex	 of
representations	 which	 constitutes	 the	 center	 of	 my	 field	 of	 consciousness	 and
appears	to	possess	a	very	high	degree	of	continuity	and	identity,”	it	is	clear	that
the	astrological	symbol	thereof	is	the	Earth	itself	as	seen	from	the	birth-place	of
the	 native.	 The	 continuous	 field	 of	 consciousness	 of	 any	 man	 is	 what	 is
contained	within	the	boundaries	of	his	horizon,	and	by	implications	what,	though
below	the	horizon,	will	emerge	into	the	field	of	his	consciousness.

In	other	words,	the	quadrature	of	the	astrological	chart	(horizon	and	meridian
—and	especially	Ascendant	and	Mid-Heaven)	represents	the	form	of	the	field	of
consciousness.	The	ego	may	be	considered	as	the	birth-point	itself,	the	center	of
the	chart—or,	in	an	even	more	accurate	symbolization,	the	apex	of	the	pyramid
built	on	the	four	angles	of	the	chart.	The	ego	is	not	the	integrator—	because	it	is
only	 an	 abstract	 point.	 Neither	 are	 Ascendant	 nor	 Mid-Heaven	 integrating
factors,	for	they	too	have	only	structural	implications.	They	determine	the	form

which	will	have	to	be	taken	by	the	process	of	integration.	They	do	not	symbolize
the	quality	of	energy	by	the	release	of	which	this	process	will,	or	may,	ultimately
be	completed.

Building	 the	 field	 of	 consciousness	 as	 a	 clearly	 formed	 structure	 centered
accurately	 in	 the	 ego	 is	 like	 building	 a	 perfect	 eye	 with	 the	 power	 of	 precise
focalization	through	the	lens	and	the	eye’s	muscles,	so	that	the	image	reflected
upon	 the	 retina	 falls	 exactly	 on	 the	 “yellow	 spot”	 of	 the	 retina	 which	 alone	 is
endowed	 with	 full	 sensitiveness	 to	 light.	 It	 is	 what	 the	 great	 eye	 specialist	 and
philosopher,	 Dr.	 Bates,	 called	 “central	 fixation”;	 and	 this	 operation	 requires
muscular	practice	and	visualizing	or	imaging	practice,	including	relaxation.

In	a	psychological	sense,	“central	fixation”	refers	to	the	use	of	the	intellect—
the	 mechanism	 of	 conscious	 focalization—according	 to	 the	 laws	 of	 logic	 and
formal	 thinking.	 Much,	 if	 not	 all,	 of	 classical	 and	 post-classical	 Greek
philosophy	(especially	since	Aristotle)	and	all	Western	science	(especially	since
the	 Renaissance)	 and	 modern	 scientific	 philosophy	 (for	 instance,	 Bertrand
Russell)	 constituted	 and	 still	 constitute	 a	 vast	 collective	 training	 in	 mental
“central	 fixation.”	 In	 the	 psychic-spiritual	 realm	 certain	 types	 of	 esoteric
practices,	some	derived	from	the	Buddhistic	world-viewpoint	in	the	East,	others
from	 the	 Pythagorean	 philosophy,	 aimed	 at	 a	 similar	 “central	 fixation”	 of	 the
soul-energies	within	a	formed	structure	of	“I	Am-ness.”	As	already	said,	it	was
around	 the	 sixth	 century	 B.C.	 that	 this	 problem	 of	 mental	 focalization	 began	 to
dominate	the	outlook	of	the	é1ite	of	mankind.	This	process	of	“central	fixation”
in	 the	 field	 of	 the	 conscious	 has	 been	 going	 on	 throughout	 the	 European	 cycle
(especially	since	Abelard),	and	has	produced	the	Western	man,	with	what	Jung
called	so	graphically	his	“cramp	of	the	conscious.”

Just	as	Dr.	W.	H.	Bates	asked	his	patients	to	relax	their	eyes	by	imagining	a
perfectly	black	spot,	so	Dr.	Jung	asks	his	to	relax	their	conscious	intellectualism
by	“letting	things	happen”	and	by	practices	of	psychic	relaxation,	such	as	the	use
of	spontaneous	creative	“phantasy.”

If	thus	the	chart-axes	represent	the	structure	of	the	field	of	consciousness—
the	structure	of	the	“eye,”	symbolically—the	Sun	stands	for	the	“light”	releasing
the	 energy	 (the	 photons)	 by	 means	 of	 which	 vision	 is	 made	 possible.	 In	 a	 real
sense	the	eye	as	an	organ	of	vision	is	moulded	structurally	by	the	nature	of	the
light.	Likewise	the	ego—the	conscious	“I”—is	moulded	by	the	power	emanating
from	 the	 Self.	 Fittingly	 therefore,	 it	 is	 said	 that	 the	 Ascendant	 and	 the	 other
“angles”	of	the	chart	distribute	the	power	of	the	Sun,	as	we	shall	see	in	the	next

chapter.	 The	 Sun	 is	 the	 life-energy.	 The	 chart’s	 axes	 are	 channels	 for	 the
distribution	 and	 “transformation”	 of	 this	 solar	 energy	 within	 the	 field	 of
consciousness.

The	 Sun,	 however,	 should	 not	 be	 considered	 as	 the	 symbol	 of	 the	 Self.	 It
represents	the	power	of	the	Self;	but	the	Self	itself	is	not	only	power.	It	is	power
in	 relation	 to	 form.	 It	 is	 power	 operating	 through	 a	 form	 and	 regenerating
substance.	 In	 other	 words,	 the	 Self,	 if	 its	 nature	 can	 at	 all	 be	 ascertained
astrologically,	 is	 the	 relation	 between	 the	 Sun	 and	 the	 axes,	 horizon	 and
meridian.

More	accurately	still,	it	is	the	relation	between	the	 significance	of	the	zodiacal

positions	 occupied	 by	 the	 Sun	 and	 the	 four	 angles-significance	 in	 terms	 of
zodiacal	 signs	 (or	 sign	 subdivisions),	 of	 degree,	 and	 of	 angular	 relationship
between	these	positions.	The	latter	refer	to	the	aspects	between	Sun,	Ascendant
and	Mid-Heaven;	but	even	more	so	to	the	house-position	of	the	Sun.

(This	 is	 the	 chart	 as	 given	 in	 “Thousand	 and	 One	 Notable	 Nativities”	 For	 a
slightly	 different	 one	 read	 American	 Astrology:	 “The	 Victorian	 Era	 as	 Seen
through	Queen	Victoria’s	Birth-chart,”	by	D.	Rudhyar.)

This	house-position	of	the	Sun	denotes	the	phase	of	individual	selfhood	and
the	period	of	the	life	in	and	through	which	the	integrative	power	of	the	Self	will
be	 the	 most	 strongly	 operating.	 By	 referring	 to	 our	 previous	 tabulation	 of	 the
meanings	of	houses,	and	to	the	schedule	of	the	28-year	cycle,	these	two	elements
of	 personality	 and	 destiny	 can	 be	 easily	 ascertained—provided	 of	 course	 the
exact	birth-moment	is	known.	The	zodiacal	position	of	the	Sun	(and	its	degree
position)	will	show	the	quality	of	this	integrative	power	in	itself.

Take	for	instance	Einstein’s	chart.	The	Sun	is	in	the	twenty-fourth	degree	of
Pisces	 in	 the	 tenth	 house.	 Therefore	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 integrative	 power	 of	 his
Self	will	be:	synthesis,	consummation,	meditation	and	introspection.	But	the	Sun
being	 in	 the	 tenth	 house	 of	 public	 activity,	 profession,	 and	 of	 thinking	 (as	 a
function	of	the	individual	selfhood),	this	power	will	operate	through	these	tenth-
house	characteristics.	The	Sun’s	position	also	indicates	that	an	intensification	of
the	significant	power	of	his	destiny	occurred	when	Einstein	was	in	his	twenty-
second	 year,	 i.e.,	 in	 1901.	 Then	 he	 became	 inspector	 of	 patents	 in	 Berne,
Switzerland;	and	it	is	probably	about	that	time,	a	little	after	Planck’s	papers	on
the	quantum	theory	were	published,	that	at	least	the	rudiments	of	the	theory	of
relativity	were	developed.	It	was	brought	to	the	attention	of	the	scientific	world
in	 1905—when	 Einstein’s	 “point	 of	 self”	 came	 in	 conjunction	 with	 Pluto.
Moreover	 the	 Sun’s	 degree,	 which,	 as	 we	 already	 said,	 “gives	 a	 clue	 to	 the
inherent	creative	significance	of	all	activities	and	all	focalizations,”	carries	this
most	 fitting	 symbol:	 “A	 small	 island	 in	 the	 midst	 of	 the	 ocean;	 its	 happy
inhabitants	have	created	a	world	of	their	own.”	What	could	be	more	significant
in	the	chart	of	the	man	who	even	wrote	of	“island	universes”	and	did	create	new
cosmic	vistas!

As	another	illustration	we	can	give	Queen	Victoria’s	chart,	which	symbolizes
not	only	a	personality,	but,	by	implication	at	least,	also	the	era	which	carries	her
name.	 The	 Sun	 had	 just	 risen	 at	 birth	 and	 it	 was	 about	 an	 hour	 after	 the	 new
moon	in	Gemini.	Here	we	have	a	personality	of	rare	intellectual	gifts	(Gemini),
an	 era	 which	 had	 all	 the	 rigidity	 and	 narrow	 viewpoints	 of	 overemphasized
intellectualism;	 which,	 moreover,	 saw	 the	 amazing	 growth	 of	 means	 of
transportation	 and	 of	 travel—and	 of	 nervous	 disturbances.	 The	 twelfth-house
meaning	is	shown	in	the	fact	that	after	her	husband’s	death	Queen	Victoria	lived
in	 practical	 seclusion	 for	 most	 of	 her	 long	 life,	 and	 that	 she	 acted	 best	 when
behind	 the	 scenes	 and	 through	 some	 great	 Prime	 Minister,	 as	 for	 instance
Disraeli.	The	symbol	of	the	Sun’s	degree	gives	the	meaning	of	aristocracy	and
efficient	strength	of	individuality.	We	may	say	that	the	whole	Victorian	era	is	a

typical	 twelfth-house	 manifestation—a	 summing	 up,	 a	 period	 of	 karmic
precipitation,	the	tail-end	of	a	cycle	prior	to	a	strikingly	new	beginning,	perhaps
now	about	to	manifest.

The	most	significant	moment	in	her	life	came	when,	at	the	age	of	56,	plans
were	definitely	made	for	the	consecration	of	the	British	Empire	and	as	an	initial
gesture	her	son	was	sent	to	India.	Then	her	“point	of	self	had	come	to	her	Sun,
and	her	personality	had	truly	become	a	world-wide	symbol,	fully	manifesting	the
power	 of	 her	 destiny—thus	 of	 her	 true	 Self.	 Her	 consecration	 as	 “Empress	 of
India”	came	a	year	later,	as	the	“point	of	self”	was	trine	Jupiter,	and	in	her	first
house.	 This	 and	 the	 Diamond	 Jubilee	 of	 1897	 (when	 “point	 of	 self”	 came	 to
conjunction	Jupiter	in	the	tenth	house)	were	the	outer	gestures	of	power.	But	the
Queen’s	 true	 selfhood	 is	 not	 to	 be	 found	 in	 them,	 but	 in	 the	 more	 concealed
“backstage”	moves	which	the	twelfth-house	lunation	so	aptly	symbolizes.

### Planets	Referring	to	the	Conscious

We	are	now	considering	the	realm	of	the	particular	ego,	which	is	the	field	of
consciousness	 centered	 around	 the	 realization:	 “I	 am	 this	 or	 that.”	 This
realization	by	the	conscious	“I”	that	he	is	that	particular	being	and	no	other	is	the
first	basic	factor	in	the	conscious	life.	Every	living	entity	must	first	be	itself	as	a
definite	exclusive	form.	This	is	the	Saturn	aspect.	Then	it	must	maintain	itself,
and	 such	 a	 factor	 of	 self-maintenance	 works	 out	 through	 the	 principle	 of
compensatory	 action	 which	 is	 the	 foundation	 of	 all	 organic	 life.	 This	 is	 the
Jupiter	 aspect.	 Finally	 it	 must	 reproduce	 itself	 through	 some	 sort	 of	 creative
action—which	refers	astrologically	to	Mars.

These	 three	 planets	 (Saturn—Jupiter—Mars)	 are	 to	 be	 considered	 as	 the
three	 positive	 or	 “masculine”	 planets,	 and	 for	 reasons	 which	 we	 shall	 consider
later	on,	are	paired	with	three	other	planets	which	are	considered	as	negative	or
“feminine”	 planets:	 respectively—Moon,	 Mercury	 and	 Venus.	 The	 terms
“masculine”	and	“feminine”	are	not	particularly	fortunate.	It	would	be	better	to
say	 that	 Saturn,	 Jupiter	 and	 Mars	 initiate	 life-processes.	 They	 act	 as	 causal
agents;	 while	 the	 Moon,	 Mercury	 and	 Venus	 establish	 or	 vivify,	 complete	 or
bring	 to	 fruition	 these	 same	 processes.	 We	 shall	 therefore	 consider	 these	 six
“planets	of	the	conscious”	as	being	three	pairs,	each	pair	being	connected	with
one	 of	 the	 three	 basic	 life-operations	 above	 mentioned.	 The	 reason	 for	 this
procedure	will	be	explained	more	fully	later,	as	to	do	so	now	would	complicate
matters	unnecessarily.

Saturn-Moon.	 Saturn,	 in	 Greek	 mythology,	 is	 the	 ruler	 of	 the	 Golden	 Age,

the	first	age	of	childhood	and	innocence.	It	refers	to	the	first	process	whereby	the
universal	life-force	becomes	differentiated,	limited,	particularized	as	a	living	cell
—as	the	initial	seed.	Such	a	process	of	differentiation	is	the	absolutely	necessary
condition	for	individual	existence,	that	is,	existence	as	a	separate	self-sufficient
entity.	 Psychologically	 speaking,	 Saturn	 symbolizes,	 therefore,	 that	 process
which	leads	to	the	realization:	“I	am.”	This	may	not	be,	however,	such	a	simple
realization	 as	 it	 may	 seem	 and	 has	 seemed	 to	 many.	 Thus	 the	 modern
psychologist	speaks	of	the	“ego-complex,”	as	previously	defined:	“A	complex	of
representations	which	constitutes	the	center	of	my	field	of	consciousness.”*

Within	the	“field	of	consciousness”	life	flows;	in	other	words,	changes	take
place,	energy	is	released	in	actions	and	re-actions.	This	“psychic	energy”	which
is	contained	and	operates	in	the	field	of	my	consciousness	(within	the	boundaries
of	 my	 ego,	 set	 symbolically	 by	 Saturn)	 is	 represented	 astrologically	 by	 the
Moon.	The	Moon	is	that	portion	of	the	Sun	which	is	enclosed	by	Saturn—if	such
an	astronomically	peculiar	sentence	may	be	allowed.	It	is	that	portion	of	the	life
energy	of	the	total	being	which	I	am	aware	of	as	myself,	as	the	conscious	ego
which	I	am.	Saturn	refers	to	the	abstract	structure	of	this	ego.	The	Moon	pours
into	 this	 structure	 “psychic	 energy”—and	 the	 result	 is	 a	 conscious	 entity,	 a
particular	living	entity.	The	relation	Saturn-Moon	is	therefore	the	relation:	form-
to-energy.	 Form	 conditions	 energy,	 though	 there	 is	 really	 a	 deep	 reciprocal
action,	which	would	be	too	long	to	discuss	in	such	a	brief	survey.

Jupiter-Mercury.	 Jupiter	 is	 a	 much	 more	 mysterious	 symbol	 than	 most
astrologers	 seem	 to	 believe.	 Its	 reputation	 as	 a	 sign	 of	 unalloyed	 good	 fortune
does	 not	 appear	 to	 stand	 the	 test	 of	 psychological	 analysis,	 even	 though,	 in	 an
abstract	sense	and	ultimately,	the	process	it	symbolizes	is	always	leading	to	an
increase	 and	 expansion	 of	 consciousness—but	 at	 times	 through	 very	 dire
ordeals.	 Jupiter	 is	 ordinarily	 opposed	 to	 Saturn	 as	 expansion	 is	 opposed	 to
contraction.	Saturn	differentiates	the	particular	entity	out	of	the	universal	matrix
of	 life.	 Jupiter	 brings	 to	 the	 bound	 ego	 that	 which	 will	 compensate	 its	 one-
sidedness,	and	thus	will	make	it	once	more	whole	and	universal.

Jupiter’s	function	can	be	best	expressed	in	practical	or	analytical	psychology
by	the	term	“compensation.”	The	self-compensatory	character	of	the	psyche,	as
an	 organism,	 has	 been	 mentioned	 in	 our	 chapter	 dealing	 with	 analytical
psychology.	Jupiter	refers	thus	to	the	anima	and	animus	of	Jung’s	theory.	But	it
means	more.	It	is	the	function	of	compensation	in	all	its	possible	aspects.	Marc
Jones	defines	Jupiter	as	“the	point	of	the	soul’s	precipitation	out	from	itself	into

tangible	 life	 and	 definite	 being.”	 It	 shows	 “the	 point	 of	 expression	 of	 true
selfhood,	 of	 the	 purpose	 of	 incarnation.”	 This	 means	 also	 “compensation”	 in	 a
metaphysical	sense.	Because	the	soul	may	be	regarded	as	that	which	constantly
strives	 for	 harmonization	 and	 integration,	 and	 the	 “purpose	 of	 incarnation,”	 as
the	neutralization	of	past	disharmonies	and	failures—	toward	the	establishment
of	harmony	at	a	fully	conscious	level.

Jupiter	is	thus	the	power	in	us	of	right	action,	the	voice	of	our	true	Destiny.
Our	conscious	ego	(Saturn-Moon)	is	the	result	of	our	past,	the	synthesis	of	our
limitations	 and	 our	 ancestry.	 It	 is	 the	 present	 as	 the	 sum	 total	 of	 the	 past.	 But
Jupiter	is	the	future,	pulling	this	present	onward.	It	is	the	destiny	which	is	to	be
ours,	the	destiny	which	will	balance	our	past	inadequacies,	and	fulfilling	which
we	 shall	 become	 whole.	 The	 soul	 and	 the	 ego	 are	 the	 two	 poles	 of	 a	 relation
which	operates	by	compensation.	Thus	for	a	masculine	consciousness	the	soul,	if
projected	 as	 an	 image,	 is	 normally	 a	 woman—the	 Muse,	 the	 Eternal	 Feminine
drawing	 us	 onward,	 etc.	 For	 a	 feminine	 consciousness	 the	 soul	 is	 the	 hero,	 the
Christ-image,	 the	 Adonai,	 Siegfried	 the	 victorious,	 etc.	 It	 is	 always	 that	 which
completes	 us,	 which	 makes	 us	 whole.	 It	 is	 also,	 for	 the	 devotee,	 the	 incarnate
God,	the	savior,	the	spiritual	teacher	or	guru:	that	divine	personage	who	comes
to	us	as	representative	of	the	Whole,	however	we	may	imagine	this	wholeness.
Therefore	Jupiter	is	God’s	path	toward	men.	It	is	religion.	It	is	ceremonial.	It	is
also	the	King,	as	a	symbol	of	the	wholeness	of	the	State;	he	whose	justice	and
strength	 (ideally)	 compensate	 the	 weakness	 and	 failures	 of	 the	 citizen.	 In	 a
Democratic	state	it	is	the	Constitution.

Mercury	 makes	 the	 Jupiter	 function	 operative.	 And	 therefore	 it	 is
intelligence,	the	vehicle	of	the	soul.	But	alas!	a	vehicle	which	often	throws	off
the	 divine	 Personage	 it	 carries	 and	 runs	 amuck,	 goaded	 by	 the	 moods	 of	 the
Moon,	or	dominated	by	the	separative	crystallizing	power	of	Saturn.	Mercury	as
ruler	of	the	nervous	system	brings	sensation	to	the	ego,	that	the	ego	may	learn
the	lesson	of	relationship	to	the	objects	of	the	outer	world.	It	unifies	the	reactions
of	 the	 body.	 It	 is	 the	 servant	 of	 Zeus-Jupiter—but	 so	 often	 an	 unworthy
messenger	and	a	thief.	The	Moon,	the	feminine	pole	of	Saturn,	has	moods	and
constantly	 changes.	 Mercury,	 which	 holds	 a	 similar	 relation	 toward	 Jupiter,	 is
ever	restless	and	moulding	itself	upon	the	object	of	the	sensation	or	the	thought.
Hindu	yoga	is	largely	a	system	of	concentration	by	means	of	which	the	Jupiter
function	subdues	the	Mercury	function.

If	Jupiter	assumes	the	position	of	an	avenging	God—if	there	is	no	other	way
to	 counteract	 Saturn’s	 crystallizations—Mercury	 is	 likely	 to	 turn	 equally

destructive	and	to	shatter	the	Moon’s	tides;	for	Mercury	is	always	more	or	less
inimical	to	the	Moon—	unless	Saturn	has	turned	subservient	to	those	functions
of	the	unconscious	which	we	shall	presently	study.

Mars-Venus.	With	this	pair	we	deal	with	the	centrifugal	and	centripetal	forces
of	experience.	Mars	“shows	the	tendency	of	the	life	in	expressing	itself,	moving
from	itself	outward	without	particular	regard	for	external	conditions.”	It	is	“the
first	 impulse	 of	 being	 in	 all	 outer	 revelation	 of	 self”	 (Marc	 Jones).	 In	 other
words,	 it	 is	 the	 desire	 to	 move	 away	 from	 the	 center,	 the	 primordial	 Eros,	 the
libido,	as	it	flows	outward	through	the	psyche.	It	symbolizes	all	beginnings,	all
initiating	impulses;	self-projection	as	a	release	of	sheer	energy.

That	which	goes	out	from	the	psyche	as	Mars,	returns	to	it	as	Venus.	Venus	is
the	effect	experienced	as	a	result	of	the	way	in	which	the	outer	world	reacts	to
our	 Martian	 outgoing.	 The	 Martian
impulse	 returns	 home	 filled	 with
experiences,	probably	with	bruises	and	possibly	with	wisdom.	Venus	is	the	end
of	 the	 experience	 and	 what	 we	 have	 gathered	 as	 a	 result	 of	 it;	 thus	 it	 is	 the
purveyor	 of	 consciousness,	 of	 knowledge	 and	 wisdom	 to	 the	 ego.	 It	 is
symbolized	 by	 bees,	 because	 bees	 bring	 back	 to	 the	 hive	 the	 honey	 gathered
from	the	flowers	which	are	also	the	last	product	of	the	plant.	It	is	therefore	the
symbol	of	all	arts,	of	all	social	wisdom,	of	all	that	is	matured	out	of	experience.
It	also	means	emotions;	because	we	get	emotions,	or	effects,	as	a	result	of	our
outer	 contacts.	 Out	 of	 relationship	 arise	 joy	 or	 pain,	 songs	 or	 despair,	 art	 or
sensuality.	The	soul	of	relationship	is	love.	Mars-love	is	the	love	that	is	desire,
self-projection,	 brute	 force	 toward	 self-reproduction	 in	 and	 through	 others,	 but
with	no	regard	for	the	others.	 Venus-love	is	the	love	that	is	wise,	the	love	that
arises	from	true	interchange,	from	altruistic	companionship:	love-wisdom.

This,	 then,	 is	 the	 outline	 of	 the	 conscious	 trinity	 of	 basic	 life-powers,	 each
active	 and	 reactive,	 which	 astrology	 symbolizes	 as	 Saturn-Moon,	 Jupiter-
Mercury,	Mars-Venus.	Every	living	entity	must	first	be	itself	as	a	definite	form
(Saturn);	 then	 it	 must	 maintain	 itself	 as	 a	 self-compensating	 system	 (Jupiter);
finally	it	must	reproduce	itself	through	creative	action	(Mars).	“Being”	manifests
through	feelings	(Moon);	“maintenance”	operates	through	intelligence	or	instinct
(Mercury);	“self-reproduction”	is	demonstrated	in	the	power	to	bear	children	or
ideas	(Venus).

### Thus	the	sphere	of	the	conscious.	We	come	now	to	the	process	whereby	the

conscious	transcends	or	destroys	itself.

### Planets	Referring	to	the	Unconscious

## A.	THE	PERSONAL	UNCONSCIOUS

The	 way	 in	 which	 the	 planets	 Neptune	 and	 Pluto	 have	 been	 discovered
serves	 as	 a	 symbolical	 illustration	 of	 the	 relationship	 between	 conscious	 and
unconscious.	It	was	found	that	certain	anomalies	in	the	behavior	of	Uranus	could
be	explained	only	by	postulating	the	influence	of	another	planet	beyond	its	orbit.
Such	 an	 influence	 was	 carefully	 measured,	 and	 the	 place	 of	 Neptune	 was
approximately	determined;	after	which	astronomers	were	able	to	find	this	planet
at	the	place	thus	analytically	discovered.

The	 existence	 of	 many	 psychological	 anomalies,	 neuroses	 and	 supernormal
states	 likewise	 led	 some	 psychologists	 to	 attempt	 to	 chart	 an	 unknown
psychological	realm	the	existence	of	which	we	have	apprehended	so	far	mostly
by	the	way	it	upsets	conscious	behavior.	It	is	apparent	that	our	conscious	ego	is
not	always	master	of	its	house,	that	at	times	powers	which	seem	to	well	up	from
nowhere	 or	 from	 some	 ancestral	 mist	 overwhelm	 our	 consciousness.	 Gone	 are
our	small	categories	and	barriers;	forgotten	are	our	sense	of	self-preservation	and
our	 social	 training—and	 we	 move	 bewildered,	 swayed	 by	 deep	 commands,
which	are	voiced	by	unrecognized	forces.

C.	G.	Jung	 was	perhaps	the	first	of	modern	psychologists	to	recognize	that
the	 realm	 of	 these	 unknown	 forces	 was	 really	 a	 twofold	 one.	 In	 this	 he	 was
merely	 following	 (unconsciously,	 perhaps)	 the	 ancient	 Kabbalistic	 tradition
which	speaks	of	a	“memory	of	Nature,”	an	“astral	light”	which	is	also	twofold,
lower	and	higher,	deceitful	and	ensnaring	in	its	lower	portions,	celestial	and	pure
in	its	higher.	Jung’s	interpretation	of	the	personal	and	the	collective	unconscious
is	 naturally	 very	 different	 outwardly	 from	 the	 occult	 teaching	 concerning	 the
astral	light;	yet	the	latter	may	prove	necessary	some	day	to	sustain	and	deepen
the	former.

As	 we	 have	 already	 seen,	 the	 personal	 unconscious	 is	 the	 sum	 total	 of
repressed	or	submerged	contents	of	a	man’s	psyche.	Freud	began	a	study	of	this
realm	in	which	are	hidden	the	seeds	of	neuroses,	and	to	which	we	relegate	all	the
feelings,	 thoughts,	 impressions	 which	 we	 refuse	 to	 admit	 to	 the	 shrine	 of	 our
conscious	being,	and	from	which	we	shrink	in	fear,	disgust	or	suppressed	hatred.
Life	 brought	 to	 us	 these	 psychic	 facts	 and	 filled	 them	 with	 vital	 energy;	 but
instead	of	allowing	this	vital	energy	to	spend	itself	in	correlation	with	our	ego,
within	the	sphere	of	our	conscious	thinking,	feeling	and	behavior,	we	turn	back,
as	it	were,	the	flow	of	this	energy	and	push	the	disturbing	thoughts	or	feelings,
impressions	or	intuitions	into	dark	caves	where	memory	can	no	longer	call	them

to	the	light	of	the	conscious.	There	they	may	fester	and	decay,	sending	poisonous
emanations	into	the	conscious;	or	the	subterranean	pressure	they	exert	may	lead
us	unaware	to	deeds	and	thoughts	bewildering	to	our	conscious	ego.

Astrology	 has	 probably	 no	 way	 of	 checking	 up	 these	 hidden	 and	 repressed
contents	 of	 the	 personal	 unconscious,	 yet	 it	 contains	 in	 its	 symbolism	 certain
factors	 which	 enable	 us	 to	 discern	 and	 analyze	 the	 action	 of	 the	 repressive
tendencies	which	twist	and	dam	up	the	normal	flow	of	psychological	functions.
In	 other	 words,	 it	 can	 detect	 the	 backwash	 of	 the	 psychic	 energy	 from	 the
conscious	 to	 the	 unconscious	 as	 it	 occurs	 in	 the	 psyche.	 It	 can	 determine	 the
polarity	 of	 psychological	 functions,	 some	 of	 which	 act	 in	 a	 repressive	 and
inward	 direction,	 others	 which	 operate	 in	 the	 normal	 way,	 from	 the	 center
outward.

Here	we	come	to	the	factor	of	planetary	retrogression.	Due	to	the	fact	that	on
the	 Earth	 we	 see	 the	 solar	 system	 from	 a	 somewhat	 peripherical	 point	 and	 not
from	 the	 center,	 the	 other	 planets	 of	 the	 system	 move	 in	 apparently	 irregular
manner.	 At	 times	 they	 appear	 to	 stand	 still,	 at	 others	 to	 move	 backward	 in	 the
direction	opposed	to	that	of	their	normal	course	around	the	Sun.	In	the	first	case
we	 speak	 of	 a	 stationary	 planet;	 in	 the	 second	 case,	 of	 a	 retrograde	 planet.
Otherwise	 the	 planet’s	 motion	 is	 direct.	 These	 geocentric	 characteristics	 of	 the
planets	 (Sun	 and	 Moon	 not	 included,	 for	 they	 are	 always	 direct)	 are	 of	 great
importance	psychologically.	Direct,	retrograde,	stationary:	This	trinity	of	modes
of	 planetary	 motion	 corresponds	 to	 some	 very	 basic	 elements	 of	 what	 we	 may
call	 psychological	 dynamics.	 Back	 of	 these	 types	 of	 motion	 we	 find	 the	 still
more	general	factor	of	planetary	speed	(apparent	speed,	in	this	case).	From	the
point	of	view	of	the	earthly	observer,	the	speed	at	which	the	planets	move	across
the	 sky	 is	 constantly	 changing.	 These	 variations	 of	 speed	 correspond	 to
variations	in	functional	intensity	of	the	psychological	factors	symbolized	by	the
planets.	The	functional	intensity	varies	as	a	result	of	many	causes;	but	the	speed-
variations	 are	 at	 least	 one	 of	 these	 causes,	 symbolically	 speaking.	 This	 is
especially	demonstrable	when	we	consider	the	speed-variations	of	Mercury	and
the	Moon,	but	it	applies	to	all	planets.

The	 faster	 the	 speed,	 the	 more	 rapid	 the	 flow	 of	 psychic	 energy	 in	 and
through	the	function	considered.	When	the	planet	becomes	stationary,	the	speed,
of	 course,	 equals	 zero.	 The	 function	 symbolized	 is	 shown	 to	 have	 extreme
stability.	A	peculiar	kind	of	doggedness	may	well	describe	this	condition.	That
particular	factor	in	the	conscious	make-up	of	the	person	will	not	let	go.	It	will
resist	 change.	 It	 will	 offer	 a	 tremendous	 power	 of	 inertia.	 As	 it	 was	 in	 the

beginning,	 so	 will	 it	 be	 ever	 after.	 Persons	 born	 with	 stationary	 planets	 will
always	present	a	characteristic	of	this	nature.	This	of	course	will	be	emphasized
if	 the	 stationary	 planet	 is	 also	 the	 ruler	 of	 the	 chart,	 or	 strongly	 placed.	 The
corresponding	 psychological	 factor	 will	 quietly	 but	 stubbornly	 hold	 its	 own
within	the	consciousness,	whatever	may	happen.

Many	 examples	 could	 be	 given,	 but	 the	 difficulty	 is	 that	 usually	 the
psychological	 characteristics	 depicted	 by	 a	 stationary	 planet	 are	 not	 obvious,
except	from	the	point	of	view	of	psychological	analysis.	The	Saturn	stationary	in
Richard	 Strauss’	 chart	 is	 a	 good	 illustration	 of	 strong	 egocentricity	 and	 of	 an
equally	 strong	 sense	 of	 form.	 Its	 being	 in	 Libra	 gives	 an	 added	 artistic
significance.

A	stationary	planet	is	said	to	be	“stationary	direct”	or	“stationary	retrograde”
according	 to	 the	 direction	 of	 its	 subsequent	 motion.	 In	 psycho-astrological
analysis	a	planet	can	be	considered	stationary	within	a	few	minutes	of	the	exact
point	 at	 which	 it	 changes	 the	 direction	 of	 its	 course.	 The	 speed	 factor	 here
involved	 is	 purely	 relative,	 and	 practically	 all	 that	 is	 required	 or	 useful	 to
consider	is	whether	the	planet’s	speed	is	above	average	(in	which	case	it	is	fast
moving)	or	below	average	(slow	moving).

Retrograde	planets	symbolize	the	turning	back	of	the	libido	(psychic	energy
or	life-force)	from	the	conscious	into	the	unconscious.	If	a	planet	is	retrograde,
the	 function	 it	 represents	 is	 not	 activated	 for	 conscious	 operation.	 The	 psychic
contents	 related	 to	 this	 function,	 instead	 of	 emerging	 directly	 in	 the	 conscious
and	thus	influencing	directly	our	behavior,	are	thrown	back	temporarily	into	the
unconscious.	 This	 does	 not	 mean	 necessarily	 that	 they	 are	 divested	 of	 their
energy.	They	merge	with	other	unconscious	contents,	then	reappear	later	in	the
consciousness	through	the	agency	of	one	of	these	functions	of	the	unconscious
which	 we	 shall	 study	 presently.	 The	 latter	 correspond	 to	 the	 planets	 Uranus,
Neptune	and	Pluto.

We	 may	 consider	 at	 first	 the	 planet	 Saturn,	 builder	 of	 the	 ego-complex.
Through	differentiation	and	isolation	Saturn	sets	apart	a	certain	amount	of	life-
energy	 and	 binds	 it	 into	 a	 form.	 It	 builds	 walls	 to	 protect	 and	 differentiate	 the
particular	entity	thus	conditioned	and	isolated	from	its	surroundings.	Saturn,	in
other	 words,	 sets	 up	 a	 system	 of	 defense	 against	 the	 outside	 world	 by
emphasizing	 the	 separate	 characteristics	 of	 the	 ego.	 “I	 am	 this	 particular
attribute,	and	no	one	else	is,	or	can	touch	it.”

### If	 Saturn	 is	 retrograde	 at	 birth,	 the	 native	 will	 not	 naturally	 and

spontaneously	 experience	 or	 feel	 this.	 He	 will	 not	 feel	 it	 to	 be	 true	 especially
with	 regard	 to	 the	 outer	 world.	 His	 Saturnian	 defense-mechanism	 will	 not	 be
directed	against	the	encroachments	of	the	outer	world—at	least,	not	immediately
and	 spontaneously.	 He	 will	 not	 feel	 himself	 fortified	 against	 the	 outer	 world—
because	the	pattern	of	his	conscious	being	is	not	very	rigid.	He	will	yield	easily
to	 external	 influences	 which	 will	 constantly	 tend	 to	 blur	 this	 pattern	 of	 his
consciousness.	 He	 will	 be	 somewhat	 defenseless	 with	 regard	 to	 external
contacts,	 and	 will	 appear	 shy,	 introverted,	 uneasy,	 un-self-assertive—or	 else	 he
will	take	an	arrogant	attitude	to	shield	his	weak	stand.	His	manners	may	then	be
abrupt	and	explosive.

Saturn	 retrograde	 will	 direct	 this	 pattern-crystallizing	 and	 wall-making
power	 inward.	 Self-assertion	 will	 be	 against	 inner	 influences.	 The	 person	 will
yield	outwardly,	but	show	a	great	power	of	resistance	against	inner,	unconscious
suggestions.	He	will	fortify	himself	spontaneously	against	impacts	coming	from
the	collective	unconscious,	from	race	tradition	and	collective	standards.	He	will
develop	a	sense	of	destiny,	separating	him	inwardly	from	his	fellow-men,	while
he	 will	 often	 be	 unable	 to	 resist	 the	 pressure	 of	 demands	 made	 upon	 him	 by
friends	and	foes	alike.	He	will	be	obdurately	self-centered	in	his	innermost	self,
while	he	may	be	unable	to	resist	anyone	asking	favors	or	gifts.

It	 may	 also	 be	 that	 a	 man	 with	 Saturn	 retrograde	 finds	 himself	 mostly
preoccupied	 with	 building	 or	 strengthening	 his	 growing	 individuality.	 The
differentiating	 function	 then	 works	 inward,	 strengthening	 the	 magnetic	 field	 of
the	 Self	 and	 crystallizing	 its	 contents	 into	 a	 form	 as	 yet	 unconscious.	 He	 will
yield	without,	only	to	be	better	able	to	endure	within.	Such	an	astrological	factor
is	 found	 in	 persons	 who	 have	 to	 guard	 their	 individuality	 against	 psychic	 or
religious	 or	 racial	 influences	 which	 are	 particularly	 strong	 in	 their	 immediate
family	environment.	The	enemy	is	in	the	unconscious,	pressing	from	within.	The
past	 is	 menacing	 the	 present.	 The	 first	 psychological	 task	 is	 therefore	 one	 of
inner	 self-protection	 and	 self-assertion.	 Thus	 the	 Saturn	 function	 operates
inward,	and	its	effect	will	usually	be	felt	only	indirectly	in	the	consciousness	and
in	 the	 behavior,	 blended	 with	 other	 unconscious	 elements.	 Nicholas	 II,	 the	 last
Czar	of	Russia,	had	Saturn	retrograde.	Ramakrishna,	the	great	Hindu	mystic,	and
the	seer,	Swedenborg,	furnish	other	examples.

In	such	cases	the	Moon	(polar	opposite	of	Saturn)	finds	herself,	as	it	were,
unprotected.	The	Moon	can	never	be	retrograde;	but	because	of	moving	around
the	Earth	she	is	either	within	or	without	the	Earth	orbit	When	within	(nearer	a
solar	conjunction),	she	operates	more	in	connection	with	the	solar	energy	of	the

Self.	 When	 without	 (nearer	 a	 solar	 opposition),	 the	 feelings	 are	 more
“extraverted”	 or	 dominated	 by	 the	 objective	 mind.	 It	 might	 be	 said	 also	 that
outside	 of	 the	 Earth’s	 orbit	 the	 Moon	 follows	 the	 centrifugal	 pull	 of	 Mars,	 the
planet	of	all	beginnings;	when	inside,	she	gives	in	to	the	centripetal	attractions	of
Venus,	 the	 planet	 of	 consummation	 and	 fulfillment.	 If	 the	 Moon	 is	 inside	 the
Earth’s	orbit	and	Saturn	is	retrograde,	the	feelings	are	directed	inward;	we	have	a
clear	case	of	introversion.	Love	goes	to	an	inner	image	rather	than	to	actual	and
real	persons.	The	feelings	are	in	any	case	somewhat	unprotected	when	Saturn	is
retrograde.	They	are	not	firmly	anchored	in,	or	they	may	cause	much	trouble	to,
the	conscious	ego.

When	 Jupiter	 is	 retrograde	 the	 function	 of	 soul-compensation	 is	 turned
inward,	affecting	the	consciousness	almost	exclusively	through	the	unconscious,
that	is,	by	means	of	dreams	and	similar	projections.	If	at	the	same	time	Uranus	is
strong,	these	projections	from	the	unconscious	can	become	extraordinarily	vivid.
If	 Jupiter	 is	 weak	 by	 sign	 position,	 this	 may	 mean	 that	 the	 compensation-
function	 is	 endowed	 with	 little	 energy;	 but	 if	 at	 the	 same	 time	 it	 is	 strong	 by
house	position,	the	compensation,	though	weak,	is	brought	out	constantly	to	the
consciousness	by	the	power	of	circumstances.	This	remark	applies	more	or	less
to	 all	 planets.	 Aspects	 to	 other	 planets	 may,	 however,	 introduce	 other	 and
contrary	 factors.	 Jupiter	 in	 an	 angular	 house	 (first,	 fourth,	 seventh,	 tenth)	 is
typical	of	strength	by	house	position.	If	direct,	the	native	is	consciously	ruled	by
his	Destiny,	usually	for	a	group-purpose.	He	may	experience	this	inner	power	in
the	form	of	some	great	Personality	leading	him	to	appointed	ends.	This	may	be
so	 especially	 if	 Jupiter	 is	 retrograde.	 If	 stationary,	 the	 native	 is	 almost	 wholly
subject	to	this	ruling	power.	The	Emperor	of	Austria,	Francis	Joseph,	whose	rule
seems	to	have	been	the	very	center	of	precipitation	of	the	karma	of	Europe,	had,
according	to	Alan	Leo,	Jupiter	retrograde	in	the	fourth	house,	square	Mars	on	the
Descendant.	 His	 was	 altogether	 an	 extraordinary	 chart.	 Bismarck	 also	 had
Jupiter	retrograde.	Aristide	Briand,	the	famous	French	Premier,	had	Jupiter	and
Saturn	retrograde	conjunct	in	his	fourth	house.

Mercury	retrograde	symbolizes	a	mind	inwardly	turned,	either	because	of	a
mystical	trend	or	because	of	a	congenital	slowness	of	perception	and	an	inability
to	project	thoughts	outward.	According	to	Marc	Jones,	the	position	of	Mercury
before	 and	 after
the	 Sun	 represents	 respectively	 mental	 eagerness	 or
deliberateness.	 “Mental	 chemistry”	 can	 be	 shown	 by	 linking	 these	 positions	 of
Mercury	 together	 with	 the	 speed	 of	 the	 Moon’s	 motion.	 Paul	 Clancy	 traced	 a
parallelism	 between	 quickness	 of	 mind	 and	 the	 speed	 of	 Mercury’s	 motion.

Outwardly	 a	 retrograde	 Mercury	 may	 give	 a	 slow	 mind;	 but	 by	 no	 means
necessarily	 so.	 It	 may	 just	 as	 well	 be	 a	 mind	 preoccupied	 mostly	 with	 the
collective	 unconscious,	 the	 mind	 of	 a	 seer.	 Abdul	 Baha,	 whom	 the	 Bahai
consider	as	a	divine	Personage,	had	Mercury	and	Saturn	retrograde	and	in	trine.
Mercury	was	in	Gemini	six	degrees	ahead	of	the	Sun;	the	Moon,	in	conjunction
with	 the	 great	 star	 of	 Persia,	 Regulus,	 also	 trine	 Neptune	 in	 Aquarius.	 In	 other
cases,	 we	 have	 the	 basis	 for	 peculiar	 mental	 complexes.	 An	 example	 of	 a
vacillating	 mind	 is	 given	 by	 Louis	 XVI,	 the	 French	 king	 executed	 by	 the
revolutionists.	 He	 had	 Mercury	 retrograde	 in	 exact	 conjunction	 with	 the	 Sun,
also	Saturn	and	Uranus	retrograde.

Mars	retrograde	indicates	that	impulses	to	action	do	not	flow	outward	from
the	 ego	 into	 spontaneous	 expression,	 but	 move	 back	 to	 the	 unconscious	 where
they	become	united	with	some	unconscious	contents	(often	collective	images).	It
is	the	power	inherent	in	the	latter	which	really	impels	the	native	to	action.	Action
does	 thus	 not	 arise	 from	 spontaneous,	 clearly	 conscious	 impulses,	 but	 from	 a
more	 or	 less	 unconscious	 motivation.	 Among	 the	 several	 retrograde	 planets	 in
the	 chart	 of	 Annie	 Besant,	 late	 leader	 of	 the	 Theosophi-cal	 Society,	 we	 find
Mars.	 Her	 acts	 often	 arose	 from	 motives	 hidden	 in	 the	 unconscious,	 whether
personal	or	collective.

Such	a	condition	may	affect	the	sexual	forces.	They	may	be	thrown	back	into
the	unconscious,	forming	complexes	and	neuroses.	On	the	other	hand,	we	may
deal	with	a	definite	attempt	to	sublimate	the	desire-nature,	as	in	the	various	yoga
disciplines.	 In	 the	 case	 of	 Annie	 Besant,	 we	 note	 also	 that	 she	 became	 known
first	as	an	apostle	of	birth	control.

With	Venus	retrograde	we	get	a	condition	in	which	the	fruits	of	experience
are	 not	 brought	 to	 the	 conscious	 ego	 and	 normally	 assimilated	 or	 released
through	various	types	of	emotions.	There	is	often	a	strong	lack	of	adjustment	to
the	conditions	of	outer	living.	The	emotional	life	is	unsatisfied,	and	unconscious
contents	 disturb	 the	 natural	 flow	 of	 consciousness	 and	 love.	 At	 times	 a	 strong
emphasis	 on	 artistic	 creation	 is	 found,	 but	 this	 is	 usually	 colored	 by	 abnormal
feelings.	A	desire	for	intoxicants	may	be	connected	with	this.	The	romantic	poet
Alfred	de	Musset	had	Venus	stationary	retrograde.

Retrograde	 planets	 must	 not	 be	 asked	 to	 tell	 too	 much,	 for	 the	 reason	 that
they	indicate	only	the	direction	in	which	some	psychological	functions	operate,
but	not	what	happens	as	a	result	of	this	backward	flowing	motion,	which	is	to	be
judged	on	the	basis	of	the	chart	as	a	whole.	A	boy	and	a	girl	instead	of	going	to

work	 at	 the	 factory,	 take	 the	 train	 and	 go	 to	 the	 city.	 We	 may	 know	 they	 have
gone	to	the	city;	but	that	will	not	tell	us	how	they	will	behave	and	what	they	will
encounter	 in	 this	 city.	 Likewise	 we	 know	 that	 when	 a	 planet	 is	 retrograde	 the
function	it	symbolizes	does	not	operate	in	the	so-called	normal	way.	The	psychic
energy	used	by	this	function	goes	in	the	direction	of	the	unconscious.	What	will
happen	to	it	there	depends	upon	all	the	other	factors	of	the	chart.

## B.	THE	COLLECTIVE	UNCONSCIOUS

In	the	planets	studied	so	far	we	have	found	a	means	of	analyzing	the	make-
up	and	constitution	of	the	individual	human	being	as	he	functions	in	the	midst	of
the	collectivity	of	which	he	is	a	part.	Family,	nation,	race,	religious	group,	club,
trade	 union	and	factory	are	 various	types	 of	collectivity.	 The	 individual	acts	in
their	midst	and	may	help	to	create	or	transform	them.	But	they	also	act	upon	the
individual.	If	he	shrinks	from	contacts	and	experiences	within	the	collectivity,	he
becomes	inhibited	and	acquires	complexes	or	special	attitudes	which	retrograde
planets,	together	with	other	astrological	elements,	help	us	to	analyze.

If	the	individual	faces	normally	his	group	and	society	in	general,	then	society
influences	him.	The	collective	in	him,	that	which	is	identical	in	all	the	men	of	his
group,	imposes	upon	the	individual	its	ageless	standards.	Society	gets	hold	of	the
individual	through	his	instincts	and	traditions.	Primordial	images	beat	upon	the
inner	walls	of	his	consciousness,	asking	admittance.	These	images	may	be	divine
or	 they	 may	 be	 devilish.	 They	 are	 the	 voice	 of	 wholeness	 compelling	 the
individual	 parts	 of	 the	 whole	 to	 take	 heed.	 The	 undertones	 of	 this	 collective
voice	are	dark	and	possessive;	its	high	overtones	are	vibrations	of	light,	songs	of
liberated	souls	that	draw	upward	toward	the	final	goal	of	Man.

This	voice	of	the	collective,	insofar	as	it	acts	upon	individuals,	is	symbolized
by	the	trinity	of	remote	planets:	Uranus,	Neptune	and	Pluto.	It	is	significant	that
these	have	become	publicly	known	at	a	time	when	humanity	is	breaking	through
isolating	barriers	of	creeds	and	dogmas,	and,	materially	if	not	yet	spiritually,	all
men	flow	into	the	ocean	of	a	common	humanity.	Uranus	became	known	as	the
American	 and	 French	 Revolutions	 broke	 the	 weight	 of	 feudalism	 and
medievalism;	 Neptune,	 as	 humanitarianism	 and	 a	 rebirth	 of	 the	 religious	 spirit
(or	 of	 its	 opposite	 pole,	 materialism),	 swept	 the	 world;	 Pluto,	 as	 mankind	 is
getting	on	its	way	toward	new	structures	of	social	relationships.

In	the	life	of	the	individual	these	planets	act	in	various	ways	and	in	widely
varying	 degrees	 of	 intensity.	 The	 more	 universal	 or	 “wholeward”
the
consciousness,	the	more	constructive	and	effective	the	action	of	these	planetary

agents	 of	 wholeness.	 In	 the	 un-regenerate	 they	 may	 either	 remain	 individually
ineffective,	or	else	become	symbols	of	the	destruction	of	the	en-shelled	ego.	In
any	 case	 they	 come	 to	 the	 individual	 ego	 as	 forces	 from	 the	 beyond	 of
consciousness,	 bearing	 messages,	 striking	 blows,	 or	 causing	 in	 him	 whom	 the
gods	have	condemned	spiritual	blindness	and	insanity.	They	may	symbolize	the
spiritual	 apex	 of	 collective	 humanity—	 whether	 it	 be	 called	 the	 Church
Triumphant,	 the	 assembly	 of	 the	 Blessed,	 or	 the	 White	 Lodge	 of	 Initiated
Adepts.	They	may	also	stand	for	what	the	newspapers	call	“society,”	or	else	for
the	power	of	the	mob.	They	may	be	the	agents	of	those	collective	forces	which
men	learn	to	know	under	the	name	of	religion.	They	may	even	speak	of	cosmic
events	 beyond	 our	 solar	 system,	 and	 bring	 to	 the	 initiated	 tidings	 from	 our
galaxy	and	forebodings	from	the	spaces	beyond.	In	any	case	they	are	wholeness
speaking	to	the	individual	particles.

### to

If	 we	 limit	 ourselves	 to	 the	 psychological	 approach	 and	 the	 relationship	 of
the	 collective	 unconscious	 to	 the	 particular	 ego,	 we	 say	 that	 Uranus	 is	 the
projective	 power	 of	 the	 unconscious,	 Neptune,	 its	 dissolving	 power,	 and	 Pluto,
its	 regenerating	 power.	 Uranus	 brings
the	 conscious	 symbolical
representations	 and	 impulses.	 This	 may	 occur	 in	 dreams	 or	 in	 waking
consciousness.	 Under	 Uranus	 come	 the	 inspirations	 of	 the	 poet,	 the	 artist,	 the
inventor,	 the	 scientist,	 the	 statesman,	 the	 religious	 reformer.	 Uranus	 is
characterized	 by	 its	 image-forming	 power.	 It	 regenerates	 the	 conscious	 by
bringing	 to	 it	 vistas	 of	 the	 whole,	 images	 and	 ideas	 of	 the	 universal	 Mind.
Strictly	speaking,	it	does	not	“regenerate.”	Instead,	it	projects	images	and	ideas
which	have	the	power	to	transform,	which	are	seeds	of	the	new	consciousness.
Transformation	 and	 creation	 are	 key-words	 of	 this	 revolutionary	 planet	 which
constantly	 pours	 new	 dynamic	 quanta	 into	 the	 heart	 of	 the	 ego-upsetting,
stimulating,	stirring,	disrupting,	the	soul	of	divine	discontent,	the	madness	of	the
anarchist	and	of	the	lawless.	Genius	or	insanity;	inspiration	or	perversion.

Neptune	 acts	 in	 more	 subtle	 and	 mysterious	 ways.	 It	 eats	 up	 like	 a	 strong
acid	the	crystallizations	of	the	ego,	ever	calling	the	particular	and	the	bound	to
the	limitless	state	of	the	universal.	It	is	the	insistent,	compassionate,	overflowing
love	of	the	whole	for	the	separate	part	which	may	not	even	know	it	is	a	“part”—
a	 love	 which	 can	 be	 most	 tender,	 yet	 which	 usually	 is	 so	 filled	 with	 cosmic
horizons	and	universal	dispassion	that	our	limited,	narrow	feelings	recoil	before
it	 in	 subtle	 awe.	 Neptune	 is	 the	 man	 transfigured	 by	 the	 Christ	 within;	 but	 he
may	be	also	the	man	lost	in	an	“artificial	paradise,”	asking	of	drugs	that	he	be
led	 beyond	 the	 jail	 of	 normal	 perception	 and	 daily	 routine	 into	 the	 realm	 of

dreams	and	visions.

Every	force	which	denies	limitations	and	tends	to	make	us	whole,	which	saps
the	strength	of	the	particular	viewpoint	and	injects	into	it	the	fluid	of	unearthly
desires;	 every	 agency	 which	 dissolves	 crystallizations	 and	 puts	 the	 lens	 of	 the
ego	 out	 of	 focus,	 which	 stirs	 us	 with	 divine	 longings	 through	 days	 of	 second
puberty	 and	 enravishes	 us	 away	 from	 family	 and	 home	 into	 the	 snow-white
peace	of	convents	or	to	the	living	fermentation	of	the	jungle—all	belong	to	the
Neptune	symbol.

Physiologically	speaking,	the	bodily	part	ruled	by	the	zodiacal	sign	in	which
Neptune	 is	 posited	 lacks	 differentiation	 and	 focalized	 growth.	 It	 appears
undeveloped.	The	life-energy	did	not	succeed	in	making	itself	concrete	enough.
Where	 Uranus	 is	 placed	 we	 often	 find,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 abnormal	 growth,
overfulness	 of	 a	 sort;	 not	 so	 much	 an	 abundance	 of	 life-force	 as	 a	 peculiar
tension	of	energy	which	creates	genius	or	freaks.	Neptune	is	the	symbol	of	the
sea,	of	the	undifferentiated,	of	cosmic	matter	in	the	prenatal	stage,	or	of	nirvana
and	infinite	compassion.	It	shows	how	society	acts	upon	the	individual;	whereas
Uranus	 indicates	 more	 the	 fecundating	 power	 of	 the	 individual,	 how	 he	 acts
upon	society,	constructively	or	destructively.	Neptune’s	keynotes	are	redemption,
universalization,	or	un-focalization.

Pluto	is	the	planet	of	the	second	birth,	ruler	of	the	Mysteries	—of	every	type
of	 group-assembly,	 of	 parliamentary	 organization	 in	 which	 new	 policies	 are
decided	upon	for	the	collectivity,	or	of	ceremonial	through	which	the	individual
and	 society	 are	 readjusted	 according	 to	 the	 outworking	 of	 a	 new	 law	 of	 being.
Jupiter	 deals	 also	 with	 governing	 bodies	 and	 with	 religious	 ceremonies—	 but
within	 the	 limits	 set	 by	 Saturn.	 In	 other	 words,	 Jupiter	 symbolizes	 racial	 gods
and	 religion	 based	 upon	 kinship	 and	 blood-relationship.	 It	 stands	 for	 hierarchy
and	autocracy—political	or	religious—this,	because	Saturn	has	first	of	all	set	the
ego,	 the	 One,	 as	 a	 ruler	 within	 certain	 boundaries.	 Jupiter	 acts	 within	 these
boundaries.	The	rule	of	Zeus	follows	that	of	Chronos-Saturn.	Jupiter	as	the	guru,
the	 spiritual	 teacher	 or	 religious	 guide,	 involves	 elements	 of	 personal
relationship.

On	 the	 other	 hand,	 Pluto	 is	 strictly	 impersonal	 and	 recognizes	 no	 personal
God	 or	 King;	 only	 an	 elected	 chairman,	 as	 it	 were.	 Its	 King	 is	 the	 Law.	 It	 is
ruthless	and	absolutely	just—but	just	in	terms	of	a	Law	which	often	transcends
our	limited	understanding,	and	may	seem	cruel.	Pluto	relates	the	ego	to	a	greater
center	 of	 being,	 part	 conscious,	 part	 unconscious.	 It	 leads	 to	 what	 C.	 G.	 Jung

calls	 the	 Self,	 the	 totality	 of	 the	 being.	 It	 symbolizes	 the	 final	 stage	 of	 the
process	 of	 individuation,	 the	 second	 birth,	 the	 “making	 perfect,”	 initiation,	 the
“birth	 of	 the	 Living	 God.”	 For	 Pluto	 is	 God-in-the-depths,	 God	 made	 concrete
and	actual	within	and	at	the	center	of	personality.	Thus	the	personality	becomes
transfigured	 into	 a	 Living	 Person.	 In	 this	 sense	 Pluto	 is	 the	 symbol	 of	 the
Incarnation	 of	 God,	 of	 the	 Apostolic	 Brotherhood,	 reflection	 of	 the	 cosmic
zodiacal	order;	of	the	White	Lodge	on	Earth.

Pluto	 represents	 the	 Law	 of	 the	 whole-Self	 in	 opposition	 to	 the	 law	 of	 the
particular	 ego	 (Saturn-Jupiter).	 His	 reign	 comes	 after	 this	 ego	 has	 been
impregnated	 with	 Uranian	 seed-ideas	 and	 archetypes,	 and	 has	 lost	 all	 its
resistance	 and	 its	 pride	 through	 the	 Neptunian	 baptism.	 Then	 Pluto,	 having
judged	the	ego	in	the	scales	in	which	are	balanced	conscious	and	unconscious,
concrete	 and	 abstract,	 particular	 and	 universal,	 initiates	 it	 into	 the	 Company	 of
the	 Perfect.	 His	 keynote	 is	 therefore	 rebirth;	also	 the	 concretization	 of	 the	 All
into	the	universal	One.

Of	 all	 the	 astrological	 signs	 which	 have	 been	 suggested	 as	 symbols	 (or
causes)	of	 the	Great	 War,	 only	one	seems	valid.	Pluto	 was	in	conjunction	 with
the	 summer	 solstice	 in	 June,	 1914,	 and	 had	 apparently	 come	 to	 his	 first
conjunction	for	a	brief	time	during	September,	1912,	at	which	time	the	Balkan
War	was	being	planned.	The	summer	solstice	is	the	point	of	cosmic	fecundation.
Life	 becomes	 concrete	 in	 the	 womb.	 The	 mystery	 of	 the	 “shedding	 of	 blood”
may	also	accompany	vast	cosmic	fecundations—or	initiations.

Pluto	 was	 entering	 Capricorn	 in	 1761-62.	 It	 was	 close	 to	 the	 time	 which
Swedenborg	 mentioned	 as	 being	 that	 of	 the	 descent	 to	 earth	 of	 the	 “New
Jerusalem.”	 From	 this	 time	 on	 the	 American	 Revolution	 was	 taking	 shape.	 In
1938	 Pluto	 will	 enter	 Leo.	 This	 could	 mark	 the	 beginning	 of	 a	 new	 era.
According	 to	 the	 Pyramid	 number-symbolism	 this	 era	 began	 September	 16,
### 1936.

The	 fact	 that	 the	 coming	 upon	 the	 astrological	 scene	 of	 Neptune	 and	 Pluto
corresponded	 to	 the	 time	 when	 different	 aspects	 of	 the	 unconscious	 gained
public	recognition	is	interesting.	Pluto	was	discovered	exactly	84	years	(cycle	of
Uranus)	 after	 Neptune	 (1846).	 In	 1848	 Europe	 witnessed	 a	 great	 revolutionary
upheaval.	It	is	the	date	of	Marx’s	Communist	Manifesto.	It	marks	the	beginning
of	 the	 spread	 of	 Spiritualism.	 The	 great	 spiritual	 movement,	 Bahaism,	 was
initiated	 in	 1844.	 In	 every	 way	 it	 was	 a	 time	 of	 religious	 enthusiasm	 and	 of
humanitarian	ideals—truly	a	Neptunian	time.	Likewise,	Uranus	became	known

in	 the	 midst	 of	 the	 revolutionary	 era	 that	 aroused	 all	 the	 Western	 world	 to	 a
realization	 of	 new	 archetypes	 of	 social	 relationship.	 Pluto	 was	 sighted	 January
21,	1930,	 as	the	 Sun	entered	the	 sign	of	 Aquarius.	 The	 decade	 thus	ushered	in
promises	 to	 vie	 in	 importance	 with	 those	 which	 made	 Uranus	 and	 Neptune
known.	The	ideals	of	the	New	Deal	are	typically	Plutonic,	insofar	as	we	have	in
this	 New	 Deal	 an	 attempt	 at	 including	 all	 social	 classes	 in	 an	 integral	 type	 of
organization	in	which	the	two	factors	of	individualism	and	collectivism	will	be
harmonized.	 Neptune	 makes	 whole,	 but	 it	 also	 leads	 to	 formlessness.	 Pluto
brings	 the	 message	 of	 concrete	 form,	 of	 organization.	 If	 often	 we	 see	 it	 as
disorganization,	it	is	because	we	can	discover	only	the	first	stage	of	the	process.
The	Great	War	meant	disorganization;	yet	it	tested	the	power	of	men	to	organize
on	a	scale	never	dreamt	of	before.	It	taught	efficiency	and	precision.	It	created
the	machinery	which	man	may	use	constructively	if	he	so	desires.

It	 is	 not	 at	 all	 improbable	 that	 under	 the	 régime	 of	 Pluto,	 as	 Paul	 Clancy
suggests,	 concrete	 and	 scientific	 proofs	 of	 human	 immortality	 will	 be
forthcoming.	Alice	Bailey	announces	the	same;	and	there	is	no	doubt	that	Pluto
deals	with	all	the	concrete	manifestations	of	the	new	order.

Uranus,	 Neptune,	 Pluto	 symbolize	 processes	 which	 bring	 the	 unconscious
and	 its	 subliminal	 powers	 to	 the	 threshold	 of	 the	 consciousness	 and	 the	 ego.
They	 are	 thus	 intermediaries	 between	 the	 Solar	 system	 proper	 and	 the	 galaxy.
Comets	are	also	intermediaries,	but	of	a	more	fleeting	quality.	We	can	conceive
the	 unconscious	 in	 terms	 of	 an	 accumulation	 of	 both	 personal	 and	 collective
conscious	contents;	in	fact	we	must	do	so,	if	we	consider	consciousness	as	bound
to	physical	organisms.	But	the	occultist	will	of	course	claim	that	the	collective
unconscious	is	the	product	as	much	of	superhuman	and	superterrestrial	Beings	as
of	the	past	generations	of	men.	He	will	consider	the	fixed	stars	astrologically	as
symbols	 of	 such	 cosmic	 entities	 as	 the	 awakened	 intuition	 may	 dimly	 sense
beyond	the	realms	known	to	human	minds.	Uranus,	Neptune,	Pluto	are	thus	links
between	the	stars	and	the	intra-Saturnian	planets—between	the	“gods”	and	men.
There	remains	one	more	point	to	be	touched	upon:	What	is	the	significance
of	the	three	remote	planets	when	retrograde?	It	is	probable	that	what	is	indicated
is	a	return-action	of	the	collective	element	to	the	collectivity,	but	with	the	added
power	of	the	individual	to	make	it	effective	in	a	new	way.	To	put	it	more	clearly:
Sooner	or	later	races	and	groups	always	degenerate.	The	individuals	composing
these	 collectivities	 fail	 to	 act	 in	 accord	 with	 the	 deepest	 instincts	 and	 the
archetypal	truths	which	belong	to	mankind,	biologically	or	spiritually.	Out	of	all
the	 sum	 total	 of	 these	 particular	 failures	 comes	 a	 general	 perversion	 or

decadence	of	the	collectivity.	A	race	or	nation	or	religious	group	falls	into	evil
ways,	 crystallizes	 or	 disintegrates.	 What	 individuals	 caused,	 individuals	 must
readjust.	 Reformers	 arise	 who	 proclaim	 the	 ancient	 forgotten	 truths,	 probably
under	a	new	garb.	These	men	are	led	by	the	living	spirit	of	collective	humanity
to	 reform	 the	 sick	 body	 of	 the	 collectivities	 of	 which	 they	 are	 parts.	 This
reforming	action	of	the	collectivity	by	the	collectivity,	through	the	individual,	is
symbolized	by	the	retrograde	motions	of	Uranus,	Neptune,	Pluto.

Uranus	 “direct”	 reforms	 or	 rather	 transforms	 the	 conscious	 ego;	 when
“retrograde,”	what	is	symbolized	is	the	reform	of	the	unconscious,	of	the	hidden
depths	from	which	the	ego	emerges.	In	some	cases	it	may	mean	that	all	the	dark
closets	 are	 being	 aired	 and	 family	 skeletons	 are	 being	 thrown	 out;	 in	 others,	 it
means	 that	 the	 man	 is	 actually	 the	 agent	 for	 some	 sort	 of	 reforming	 impulse
which	 is	 to	 change	 the	 mind	 of	 his	 race	 or	 group.	 The	 Uranian	 images	 he
projects	 are	 impregnated	 first	 of	 all	 with	 an	 iconoclastic	 energy.	 They	 will	 not
only	challenge	the	conscious	of	the	race,	but	generate	storms	in	the	unconscious.
Neptune	 retrograde	 is	 found	 often	 where	 religious	 shams	 are	 unearthed	 and
denounced;	where	inner	subconscious	pride	is	subtly	annihilated.	Mystics	often
have	 such	 a	 factor	 prominent	 in	 their	 charts,	 especially	 if	 they	 stand	 positively
against	beliefs	of	their	day.	As	for	Pluto	retrograde,	one	can	only	surmise	that	it
would	tend	to	let	loose	organized	destruction—this,	in	an	individual	chart,	might
be	connected	with	a	peculiar	protest	against	the	established	order	of	society.

### The	Solar	System	As	Personality

Our	approach	so	far	has	dealt	with	purely	psychological	factors,	and	we	have
considered	 planets	 as	 symbols	 which	 would	 enable	 us	 to	 chart	 the	 three	 main
types	of	activity	characteristic	of	any	life-organism:	activities	determining	what
the	 organism	 is,	 how	 it	 maintains	 itself,	 how	 it	 reproduces	 itself.	 Then	 we
studied	 problems	 arising	 from	 the	 repression	 of	 natural	 organic	 activities	 as
symbolized	in	retrograde	planets.	Lastly	we	analyzed	the	three	modes	of	activity
by	means	of	which	the	particular	ego	is	able	to	transcend	itself	and	to	partake	of
the	 character	 of	 universality.	 The	 Saturn-image	 which	 is	 the	 foundation	 of
particular	ego-hood	then	fades	into	a	type	of	representation	Plutonic	in	character.
The	Jupiter	mode	of	compensatory	activity	gives	way	to	a	Neptunian	process	of
sublimation.	 The	 Mars	 type	 of	 self-reproduction	 is	 superseded	 by	 Uranian
creativeness.

If,	however,	we	approach	the	subject	from	a	reverse	direction,	that	is,	starting
from	an	analysis	of	the	solar	system	as	a	whole	and	projecting	the	result	thereof

into	 our	 physio-psychological	 experience,	 we	 get	 a	 more	 logical	 and	 more
ordered	 picture.	 Our	 concept	 of	 personality	 broadens	 and	 assumes	 cosmic
perspectives.	The	whole	solar	system,	seen	as	a	complex	life-organism,	becomes
a	 cosmic	 personality.	 However,	 we	 must	 carefully	 avoid	 the	 mistake	 of	 losing
our	 base	 of	 operation:	 the	 Earth.	 “Cosmic”	 as	 we	 may	 be,	 we	 are	 always	 and
forever	rooted	in	the	Earth.	The	only	solar	system	we	know	is	that	which	is	seen
through	 the	Earth-atmosphere	and	by	means	 of	earthly	senses	 and	 instruments.
We	 know	 nothing	 in	 fact	 beyond	 the	 Earth	 and	 the	 reactions	 which	 the	 Earth
experiences	 from	 outside.	 We	 must	 always	 remain	 Earth-centered,	 because	 as
long	 as	 we	 operate	 through	 Earth-born	 vehicles	 of	 consciousness,	 refined	 as
these	 may	 be,	 all	 our	 experiences	 are	 conditioned	 by	 the	 quality	 of	 our	 planet,
and	 all	 the	 vital	 symbols	 which	 we	 may	 conceive,	 being	 necessarily
interpretations	 and	 extensions	 of	 these	 experiences,	 must	 be	 grounded	 in	 the
viewpoint	of	the	Earth	and	of	Man	as	a	planetary	being.

If,	therefore,	we	speak	of	the	solar	system,	it	is	as	it	appears	to	the	scientific
investigator,	 spreading	 on	 each	 side	 of	 the	 path	 described	 yearly	 by	 the	 Earth.
There	are	celestial	bodies	within	the	confines	of	the	Earth’s	orbit	and	there	are
some	outside	of	it.	It	is	true	that	the	Sun	is	demonstrably	one	of	the	foci	of	this
elliptical	 Earth-orbit,	 and	 also	 of	 all	 other	 planetary	 orbits.	 But	 all	 it	 means	 is
that	we,	human	observers,	are	not	at	the	center	of	the	system	to	which,	we	know
enough	now	to	realize,	we	belong	as	a	mere	planet.	This	fact	of	our	knowing	that
the	 Sun	 is	 the	 center	 of	 the	 system,	 and	 not	 the	 Earth,	 does	 not	 make	 a	 truly
heliocentric	point	of	view	legitimate.	We	know	this	fact	intellectually,	yet	all	our
experiences	are	necessarily	Earth-centered.	In	other	words,	I,	the	ego,	know	now
that	the	field	of	my	consciousness	(my	own	Earth)	is	not	the	center	of	my	total
being.	 I	 assume	 that	 there	 is	 a	 Self	 which,	 Sun-like,	 is	 the	 center	 of	 this	 total
being.	 Yet	 I	 do	 not	 experience	 as	 a	 Self,	 but	 only	 as	 an	 ego.	 I	 postulate	 the
possibility	of	an	identification	of	this	ego	with	the	Self.	But	if	I	did	 experience
such	an	identification	I	would	no	longer	be	an	ego-centered	personality.	I	would
be	a	divine	Personage—with	a	solar	vehicle	of	consciousness—whatever	it	may
mean.	 It	 may	 be	 that	 there	 are	 divine	 Personages	 operating	 through	 an	 Earth-
born	 body,	 but	 if	 so,	 the	 personality	 rooted	 in	 that	 body	 and	 perceived	 by
ordinary	man	is	not	their	true	Personality.	And	thus	we	cannot	profitably	discuss
a	 “Solar	 Personality”	 which	 we	 as	 Earth-beings	 will	 never	 experience	 fully;
neither	 is	 there	 any	 validity	 in	 assuming	 a	 Sun-centered	 point	 of	 view	 as	 the
basis	of	a	system	of	symbolical	life-interpretation.	Our	cosmic	flights	must	start
from	and	end	on	the	Earth—or	else	they	must	remain	dreams	and	speculations

without	vital	meaning.

Let	 us,	 therefore,	 consider	 the	 solar	 system,	 from	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the
Earth	 and	 of	 Man,	 as	 a	 planetary	 whole.	 We	 shall	 divide	 the	 solar	 system	 into
that	 part	 which	 is	 contained	 inside	 of	 the	 Earth-orbit	 and	 that	 part	 which	 is
outside	of	the	Earth-orbit.	Inside	the	Earth-orbit	we	find	the	inner	planets	Venus,
Mercury	 and	 the	 Sun;	 outside	 of	 it,	 the	 outer	 planets	 Mars-Jupiter-Saturn	 and
Uranus-Neptune-Pluto.	 The	 relative	 positions	 of	 these	 planets	 within	 these	 two
celestial	realms	will	give	to	each	planet	its	essential	symbolical	meaning;	for,	let
us	repeat	it	again	and	again,	the	basic	meanings	of	the	planets	belong	to	them	by
the	 logic	 of	 their	 positions	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 Earth	 and	 by	 virtue	 of	 their
astronomical	 characteristics,	 such	 as	 speed	 of	 revolution	 and	 rotation,	 mass,
color,	 number	 of	 satellites,	 etc.	 In	 other	 words,	 Venus	 has	 a	 certain	 basic
meaning	 simply	 because	 it	 is	 the	 first	 planet	 between	 the	 Earth	 and	 the	 Sun.
Likewise	 there	 can	 be	 no	 doubt	 as	 to	 the	 basic	 meaning	 of	 Pluto,	 because	 this
meaning	is	derived	from	its	position,	orbital	characteristics,	etc.	Of	course	such	a
meaning	is	both	very	basic	and	very	abstract	or	general—as	abstract	or	general
almost	 as	 the	 meanings	 of	 the	 numbers	 2	 and	 3.	 Therefore,	 in	 applying	 this
meaning	to	 the	interpretation	 of	 particular	 nativities,	statistics	and	accumulated
experience	 are	 absolutely	 invaluable.	 They	 do	 not,	 however,	 give	 birth	 to	 the
basic	meaning.

This	is	particularly	important	when	we	consider	the	Moon	as	an	astrological
factor.	For	the	ancients,	the	Moon	was	the	handmaid	of	the	Sun,	the	secondary
“light”	that	shone	by	night.	The	entire	symbolism	of	Sun	and	Moon	was	built	on
these	data	of	experience	concerning	the	light	of	Sun	and	Moon,	and	the	physio-
psychological	correlations	established	between	sunlight	(day,	warmth,	etc.)	and
moonlight	(night,	mystery,	fear,	etc.).

Such	correlations	are	no	longer	the	main	generators	of	significance	in	terms
of	modern	scientific	knowledge	and	behavior.	For	one	thing,	artificial	light	has
changed	night	into	day,	and	modern	city	living	has	made	of	office-days	a	sort	of
night.	But	deeper	than	this,	the	attribution	of	meaning	to	the	planets	(and	to	all
astrological	factors)	must	now	be	established	upon	what,	to	us	modern	men,	is
our	basic	knowledge—scientific,	intellectual	knowledge.

From	 this	 astronomical	 point	 of	 view,	 the	 Moon	 occupies	 a	 special	 place
indeed	 as	 the	 satellite	 of	 the	 Earth.	 Revolving	 monthly	 around	 the	 Earth,	 it	 is
found	half	of	the	time	within	the	Earth-orbit,	half	of	the	time	outside	of	it.	As	a
result	of	this	the	Moon	is	the	link	between	the	inner	and	the	outer	realms	of	the

solar	system;	between	the	inner	and	the	outer	planets.	Because	of	this	function	of
linkage	it	appears	constantly	changing	in	its	aspects.	It	has	phases,	waxing	and
waning	 tides;	 a	 definite	 dualistic	 rhythm.	 At	 New	 Moon,	 the	 Moon	 is	 at	 its
innermost	point	within	the	Earth-orbit.	At	Full	Moon,	it	is	at	its	outermost	point
outside	of	the	Earth-orbit.	Subjectivity	and	objectivity.

Previously,	as	we	studied	the	planets	in	pairs,	we	said	that	the	Moon	was	the
feminine	 counterpart	 of	 Saturn.	 But	 such	 a	 statement,	 while	 true	 in	 a	 certain
sense,	 must	 not	 be	 taken	 as	 definite.	 There	 is	 a	 “mystery”	 connected	 with	 the
Moon,	and	it	has	to	do	with	the	change	which	took	place	(potentially	at	least)	at
the	close	of	the	archaic	ages	(around	600	B.C).	If,	now,	we	study-the	solar	system
from	the	point	of	view	of	the	Earth-orbit,	and	if	we	proceed	to	pair	the	outer	and
the	inner	planets,	we	shall	have	the	following	result:

Mars	and	Venus	standing	on	each	side	of	the	Earth	become	polar	opposites;
so	do	Jupiter	and	Mercury;	then	Saturn	and—	the	Sun.	Before	we	discuss	what
the	Sun	signifies	here,	let	us	repeat	that	the	outer	planets	are	positive	in	the	sense
of	 referring	 to	 the	 causes	 of	 the	 activities	 represented	 by	 the	 pairs;	 while	 the
inner	planets	refer	to	results,	and	are	thus	called	negative.	Mars	symbolizes	the
initiating	 and	 impulsive	 power	 that	 starts	 all	 life-activities;	 Venus,	 the
consummating,	 concluding,	 fruit-bearing	 energy	 which	 closes	 up	 all	 cycles	 of
activity.	Jupiter	symbolizes	the	power	of	circulation	within	every	organic	whole
and	 that	 which	 expands	 them	 from	 within	 and	 which	 makes	 them	 whole.
Mercury	 is	 the	 nervous	 system,	 and	 later	 the	 power	 of	 thought	 which
consolidates	 and	 becomes	 the	 vehicle	 of	 the	 Jupiterian	 power,	 Saturn	 is	 the
original	 power	 which	 starts	 every	 life-manifestation	 by	 isolating	 from	 the
undifferentiated	 ocean	 of	 life	 a	 particular	 fragment	 thereof,	 and	 which,	 by
building	 a	 wall	 around	 this	 fragment,	 enables	 it	 to	 be	 a	 separate	 independent
entity.

Then	what	of	the	polar	opposite	of	Saturn?	Logically	it	ought	to	be	the	Sun.
But	there	has	also	been	a	great	deal	of	talk	about,	even	an	ephemeris	of,	an	intra-
Mercurial	planet,	Vulcan.	We	do	not	know	whether	or	not	Vulcan	exists.	But	one
cannot	 base	 astrological	 significance	 on	 merely	 possible	 astronomical	 facts.
Vulcan	 may	 exist.	 But,	 whether	 it	 exists	 or	 not,	 what	 it	 stands	 for,	 as
significance,	can	be	attributed	much	more	satisfactorily	to	the	photosphere	of	the
Sun.	Occultists	have	said	that	we	do	not	know	the	real	Sun,	that	what	we	see	is
only,	 as	 it	 were,	 the	 light	 that	 comes	 through	 an	 open	 window.	 This	 light
constitutes	what	may	be	called	the	surface	of	the	Sun,	the	actively	radiant	part	of

the	Sun.	Actually	it	is	all	that	we	know	of	the	Sun,	sensorially	and	physically.	It
is	 the	 source	 of	 “solar	 vibrations;”	 and	 those	 mean	 to	 us,	 life	 and	 light.	 Saturn
sets	the	boundaries	of	every	particular	living	organism	and	thus	helps	to	focalize
within	 these	 boundaries,	 as	 if	 through	 a	 lens,	 the	 diffuse	 light	 of	 interstellar	 or
galactic	 space.	 The	 Sun	 is,	 in	 a	 sense,	 the	 lens	 itself.	 The	 photosphere	 is	 the
totality	 of	 the	 light	 and	 heat	 rays	 which	 are	 focalized	 and	 which	 fill	 in	 the
boundaries	of	the	living	organism.	Saturn	differentiates.	The	photosphere	makes
the	differentiated	entity	alive.

Thus	we	have	a	two-fold	trinity	of	inner-outer	planets.	Each	of	these	planets
stands	 for	 a	 polarity	 of	 triune	 life:	 three	 positives	 and	 three	 negatives.	 What	 is
the	“seventh”?—for,	we	are	told	in	all	philosophies,	the	great	number	of	all	life-
manifestations	is	7.	The	seventh	is	that	which	correlates	the	opposite	polarities.
It	 is	 that	 which,	 moreover,	 collects	 these	 polar	 energies	 and	 distributes	 them
through	a	cyclic	tidal	process	to	the	living	organism.	It	is	the	Moon.

Without	 the	Moon,	there	 would	 be	no	interchange,	 no	relationship	 between
the	 inner	 and	 outer	 planets.	 There	 would	 be	 no	 flow	 of	 energies	 within	 and
through	 the	 Earth.	 On	 each	 side	 of	 the	 Earth,	 the	 planets	 stand.	 But	 it	 is	 the
Moon	 which	 collects	 their	 energies	 as	 it	 shuttles	 back	 and	 forth	 between
innermost	and	outermost.	Having	collected	and	blended	them,	it	distributes	them
to	the	Earth.	It	feeds	the	Earth	with	these	energies.

Thus	the	Moon	is	the	womb	and	the	mother	of	the	Earth.	It	is	the	lymphatic
fluid.	It	is	the	watery	flow,	the	sap	within	the	plant.	It	collects	all	cosmic	forces
and	distributes	them	to	the	embryo	within	its	womb.	It	collects	all	mineral	salts
of	 the	 soil	 and	 distributes	 them	 to	 the	 entire	 plant.	 It	 is	 the	 placenta	 orbitally
surrounding	 the	 Earth,	 as	 the	 placenta	 surrounds	 the	 embryo.	 The	 Moon	 may
indeed	be	called	“she”—the	mother.	She	is	the	mother-force,	the	waters	of	life.
But	 she	 is	 also	 the	 possessive	 mother-love	 that	 stifles	 and	 enwombs	 the	 child,
drawing	 him	 back	 to	 the	 cradle,	 psychologically:—the	 mother-complex,	 the
thralldom	of	feelings	and	sentimentality.

Yet	we	have	touched	only	the	fringe	of	the	garment.	Is	there	only	one	inner
planet	and	one	outer	planet?	Here	the	“mystery	of	the	Moon”	begins	to	open.	For
there	 must,	 of	 course,	 be	 one	 “Moon,”	 one	 linking	 agency,	 for	 every	 polar
duality.	 We	 saw	 that	 there	 are	 three	 pairs	 of	 planets,	 three	 basic	 powers	 of	 life
(being	a	self;	maintaining	oneself;	reproducing	oneself)	in	every	living	organism.
Then	 there	 must	 be	 three	 “Moons,”	 and	 our	 physical	 Moon	 is	 only	 the	 agency
which	links	the	closest	planetary	pair,	that	of	Mars	and	Venus.	Because	it	is	the

closest	 it	 is	 the	 most	 visible,	 the	 most	 obvious,	 the	 most	 outwardly	 and
consciously	compelling;	the	source	of	our	most	patent	desires	and	feelings.	But
there	 must	 be	 also	 a	 “Moon”	 to	 correlate	 the	 couple	 Jupiter-Mercury	 and
distribute	 their	 harmonized	 energies	 to	 the	 Earth;	 and	 again	 a	 “Moon”	 to
distribute	to	us	the	correlated	energies	of	Saturn	and	the	photosphere.

But	 where	 are	 those	 “Moons”?—the	 reader	 may	 ask.	 Perhaps	 there	 are	 no
actual	celestial	physical	masses	of	 substance	which	would	 fill	 the	 office	 of	 the
two	 “higher	 Moons”	 above	 mentioned.	 Perhaps	 they	 exist	 in	 an	 invisible	 state,
reflecting	 light	 too	 much	 toward	 the	 infra-red	 or	 ultra-violet	 to	 be	 visible.
Perhaps	 it	 is	 these	 “higher	 Moons”	 which	 “clairvoyants”	 have	 seen	 and	 have
taken	for	planets	revolving	around	the	Sun.	Perhaps	the	“mystery-planet”	behind
the	Moon	is	the	next	“higher	Moon.”	There	are	many	“perhapses.”	But	what	of
it?

What	we	are	speaking	of	are	cycles	of	motion	and	of	distribution	of	energy.
One	 of	 these	 cycles	 is	 operating	 with	 or	 through	 our	 visible	 Moon,	 and	 is
approximately	a	28-day	cycle.	Another	of	these	cycles	is	beginning	to	be	known
as	a	40-month	cycle,	affecting	financial	changes	and	the	heat	of	the	Sun.	Another
cycle	is	the	well-known	“sun-spots	cycle”	of	eleven	years	plus.	All	such	cycles
are	really	cyclic	paths	of	circulating	energy	(or	abstract	correlations	of	motion—
if	one	prefers	to	be	more	abstract).	Whether	they	operate	through	the	agency	of	a
physical	 body	 such	 as	 our	 Moon,	 or	 through	 some	 flow	 of	 magnetic	 particles
tidal	 in	 its	 effects—there	 is	 no	 difference	 as	 far	 as	 astrological	 symbolism	 is
concerned.	What	counts	in	the	cyclic	activity	is	the	flow	of	“something”	that	the
astrologer	can	relate	symbolically	to	a	life-function	(collective	and	social	as	well
as	 individual).	 What	 the	 “something”	 is,	 whether	 a	 solid	 planet	 or	 a	 tide	 of
electric	particles,	or	even	an	abstraction	pure	and	simple—this	should	be	but	of
slight	 importance	 to	 the	 astrologer.	 It	 belongs	 to	 the	 astronomer	 to	 find	 out	 all
the	scientific	facts	about	it.

The	 following	 sketch	 may	 help	 to	 make	 clear	 how	 and	 where—
schematically	 of	 course—the	 “Moons”	 operate.	 The	 first	 (our	 physical	 Moon)
links	the	orbs	of	Mars	and	Venus,	and	has	a	period	of	approximately	28	days.	It
refers	to	the	realm	of	physical	action	and	physiological	procreation.	It	represents
all	 the	 “feelings”	 connected	 with	 that	 realm.	 It	 vitalizes	 all	 things,	 even	 those
most	 remotely	 connected	 with	 sex,	 and	 all	 creative	 activity	 insofar	 as	 such
activity	 has	 a	 material	 concrete	 basis	 of	 manifestation	 through	 bodily	 motions
(all	 fine	 arts,	 as	 they	 involve	 muscular	 activity	 of	 one	 kind	 or	 another).	 It
vitalizes	 therefore,	 almost	 exclusively,	 the	 man	 and	 woman	 functioning	 at	 an

instinctual	 and	 physiological	 stage.	 It	 operates,	 moreover,	 in	 and	 through	 the
cycle	of	growth	and	decay	of	all	biological	organisms.

The	 second	 “Moon”	 links	 the	 orbs	 of	 Jupiter	 and	 Mercury,	 collects	 and
distributes	their	energies	to	the	Earth.	The	period	of	this	activity	is	probably	40
months.	The	number	is	significant	and	links	the	cycle	with	the	gestation	cycle	of
40	weeks.	This	number	40	is	found	most	frequently	in	Biblical	symbolism,	and
refers	to	a	period	of	tribulation	and	interior	formation	(as	the	gestation	period	is,
of	course).	Even	of	late,	Abdul	Baha,	leader	of	the	Bahai	cause,	is	said	to	have
been	imprisoned	in	Akka	(which	means	“womb”)	for	40	years:	a	symbol	of	the
formation	of	the	new	spiritual	era	entered	in	after	his	death,	or	at	his	birth.

It	seems	that	the	40-month	cycle	has	two	meanings,	just	as	Jupiter	has	two
meanings:	1)	spiritual—referring	to	processes	of	Soul-growth	and	psycho-mental
development	or	“initiation”;	2)	financial—as	a	mean	cycle	of	20	months	up	and
20	 months	 down,	 accounting	 for	 movements	 in	 prices	 and	 volume	 of

transactions	(Cf.	T.	O.	McGrath,	“Solar	Radiation	and	Business	Activity,”	in	the
Bulletina	April-May-June,	1934).	Interestingly	enough,	the	Jupiter	symbol
is
really	a	number	4	figure.	It	might	also	be	added	that	the	asteroids	between	Mars
and	Jupiter	might	be	the	result	of	the	explosion	of	such	a	“Moon”	to	which	some
traditions	perhaps	refer	as	“Lucifer.”

The	third	“Moon”	links	the	orb	of	Saturn	and	the	photosphere	of	the	Sun.	It
refers	 to	 the	 “sun-spot	 cycle”	 of	 11.2	 years.	 According	 to	 H.	 P.	 Blavatsky,	 this
cycle	 measures	 the	 heartbeats	 of	 the	 solar	 system,	 its	 “blood-circulation.”	 This
cosmic-magnetic	“blood”	flows	from	the	photosphere	to	Saturn	(the	limit	of	the
solar	 system	 considered	 as	 a	 strict	 unit)	 in	 five	 years;	 comes	 back	 to	 the
photosphere	in	five	more	years,	and	circulates	within	the	Sun	itself	for	one	more
year.	The	11-year	cycle	refers	to	definite	magnetic	changes	in	the	human	body—
to	conditions	within	the	spine.	It	probably	refers	also	to	the	process	of	dynamic
spiritual	integration,	known	in	Eastern	occultism	as	“the	Kundalini	 process.”	It
links	 the	 Saturn	 center	 at	 the	 base	 of	 the	 spine	 to	 the	 multi-petalled	 “lotus”	 on
the	top	of	the	head—the	“halo”	of	saints	and	buddhas	—truly	a	photosphere	or
corona	of	the	“spiritual	sun”	within	the	head.

We	must	come	now	to	consider	the	outermost	planets,	Uranus,	Neptune	and
Pluto.	 If	 we	 still	 take	 the	 Earth	 orbit	 as	 a	 hinge,	 we	 shall	 see	 that	 these
universalistic	planets	are	balanced	only	within	the	very	“heart	of	the	Sun.”

In	 our	 previous	 discussion,	 “The	 Sun	 as	 Integrator,”	 we	 wrote	 that	 the	 Sun
represents	 the	 power	 of	 the	 Self—not	 the	 Self	 itself.	 This	 integrating	 power	 of
the	Self	operates	first	of	all,	during	the	development	of	Man’s	psyche,	within	the
Saturn-defined	 boundaries	 of
the	 conscious.	 Saturn	 plus	 Sun-power
(photosphere)	 constitute	 the	 “I	 am”—Saturn	 is	 “I”	 and	 Sun-power	 is	 “am”—
always	considering	our	Earth-centered	solar	system	as	a	“cosmic	personality.”

Then	the	Saturnian	“I”	becomes	transcended	through	the	triune	life	process
symbolized	 by	 Uranus-Neptune-Pluto.	 These	 three	 planets	 represent	 what	 Jung
calls	the	“Not-I,”	that	which	must	be	assimilated	by	the	“I.”	As	this	assimilation
takes	 place,	 the	 “cosmic	 personality”	 expands;	 better	 still,	 it	 experiences	 a
repolarization	 or	 “conversion.”	 Within	 the	 “heart	 of	 the	 Sun”	 arises	 a
transfigured	“I,”	and	this	“I”	finds	his	“am”	in	the	power	of	the	trinity	Uranus-
Neptune-Pluto.	This	planetary	trinity	constitutes	the	process	by	means	of	which
the	“cosmic	personality”	finds	itself	linked	to	the	vaster	astronomical	whole,	let
us	say,	the	galaxy.

### One	might	ask:	But	what	is	really	meant	by	the	“heart	of	the	Sun”?	It	is	the

Self.	And	the	Self	is	the	wholeness	of	the	fulfilled	and	integrated	personality—
an	 abstraction.	 And	 yet	 even	 this	 abstraction	 is	 susceptible	 of	 being	 concretely
symbolized	in	terms	of	the	next	vaster	whole.	We	might	thus	say	that	the	“heart
of	 the	 Sun”	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 (Earth-centered)	 galactic	 whole	 is	 the	 star	 which
(within	our	galaxy)	is	located	exactly	behind	the	Sun.	This,	however,	has	hardly
any	practical	significance	for	us,	ordinary	men!

What	 has	 significance,	 however,	 is	 the	 idea	 that	 there	 is	 a	 cycle	 of	 linkage
between	the	Uranus	orb	and	the	“heart	of	the	Sun,”	a	fourth	“Moon.”	This	cycle
is	the	28-year	cycle	of	individual	selfhood,	which,	repeated	three	times	(once	for
each	of	the	three	outermost	planets),	give	the	time	of	the	symbolical	“building	of
the	 Temple	 of	 Sol-o-Mon”	 (the	 Sun	 of	 Man):	 84	 years—the	 period	 of	 Uranus’
revolution	 around	 the	 Sun.	 Two	 28-year	 cycles	 (one	 56-year)	 constitute,
according	 to	 Mr.	 McGrath,	 the	 major	 business	 cycle.	 This	 cycle	 equals	 three
nodal	cycles	of	18.6	years	each	and	five	sun-spot	cycles	of	11.2	years	each.	Such
correspondences	 throw	 light	 upon	 the	 significance	 of	 Neptune,	 when	 fully
understood;	as	the	sidereal	period	of	Neptune	equals	three	56-year	periods.

All	 these	 cycles,	 which	 can	 be	 considered	 as	 higher	 “Moons,”	 are	 most
important	in	the	study	of	“cosmic	personality,”	for	they	symbolize	“functions	of
linkage”	 between	 the	 soul-energies	 which,	 when	 fully	 integrated,	 are	 the
substance	of	this	“cosmic	personality,”	so	conveniently	symbolized	for	us	by	the
complex	 pattern	 of	 the	 solar	 system	 as	 understood	 from	 the	 Earth.	 Such
“functions	 of	 linkage”	 were	 held	 esoteric	 and	 mysteriously	 sacred	 in	 archaic
cosmo-psychology.	Thus	the	“mystery	of	the	Moon.”

This	 mystery,	 for	 the	 ancients,	 resided	 in	 the	 attribution	 of	 the	 Moon	 as	 a
polar	 opposite	 to	 Saturn.	 When	 mankind	 was	 functioning	 purely	 at	 the
physiological	level,	and	mind	was	hardly	an	independent	factor	or	a	basis	for	the
focalization	of	life-energies,	then	it	was	indeed	the	Moon	which,	as	the	Mother-
force,	 animated	 the	 egos	 (the	 Saturnian	 boundaries)	 of	 men.	 Men	 are	 still,
psychologically,	within	the	womb	of	the	Mother—and	this	at	the	physiological-
instinctual	 (Mars-Venus)	 level	 of	 operation.	 But	 as	 men	 become	 mentally
polarized	and	rise	out	of	the	psychological	Mother-womb	into	the	realm	of	pure
energy	and	independent	thought,	then	they	become	progressively	filled	with	the
power	of	the	solar	photosphere.	Their	Saturnian	egos	become	illumined,	and	the
“higher	Moon,”	Lucifer	(i.e.,	Light	Bearer),	“bears	light”	to	them,	the	light	of	the
correlated	Jupiter	and	Mercury.	A	next	step	in	spiritual	development	will	make
them	illumined	by	the	power	of	the	Kundalini	Moon	(Isis?)	linking	 Saturn	and
the	 solar	 photosphere;	 another	 step	 will	 see	 them	 vitalized	 by	 the	 correlation

Uranus-Sun	 (Osiris?).	 We	 believe	 that	 the	 “mystery-planet	 behind	 the	 moon”
was	 no	 planet,	 but	 this	 second	 “Moon”	 which	 we	 called	 Lucifer—the	 Jupiter-
Mercury	link.	The	asteroids	are	the	remnants—or	are	they	not	rather	the	prenatal
condition?—of	this	Lucifer.	May	not	the	myriads	of	asteroids	be	a	symbol	of	the
scattered	state	of	men’s	psycho-mental	energies,	or	soul-forces?	The	Great	Work
of	 the	 spirit	 is	 the	 integration	 of	 these	 scattered	 soul-forces	 into	 a	 spiritual
organism,	 a	 “temple	 of	the	 living	 God.”	Thus	every	 man	 must	 integrate	within
himself	 these	 “asteroids”	 and	 make	 them	 into	 a	 “Moon”	 through	 which	 the
power	of	soul	(Jupiter)	and	the	power	of	mind	(Mercury)	will	be	correlated	and
made	cyclically	operative.

After	 this	 preliminary	 work	 of	 psycho-mental	 integration,	 concentration,	 or
yoga,	will	come	a	further	stage—symbolized	by	Kundalini—Isis.	The	veil	of	Isis
is	then	to	be	lifted	by	the	candidate	to	initiation.	Man	finds	himself	surrounded
by	 the	 halo	 of	 the	 living	 God,	 by	 the	 multi-flamed	 radiance	 of	 the	 Corona.
Finally	man	himself	becomes	a	Sun.	His	heart	beats	in	unison	with	the	“heart	of
the	Sun.”

The	 physical	 moon	 represents	 normal	 mankind	 today.	 The	 three	 “higher
Moons”	 stand	 for	 the	 three	 stages	 of	 Masonic	 initiation:	 Apprentice	 —
Companion	 —	 Master.	 These	 stages	 symbolize	 ritualistically	 the	 three	 basic
phases	of	the	process	of	personality-integration—of	the	gestation	of	the	“Living
God,”	the	Christ-child,	within	the	psyche.

## PLANETARY	INTERWEAVINGS

The	study	of	the	higher	“Moons”	and	of	the	“functions	of	linkage”	which	they
symbolize	 has	 prepared	 us	 for	 further	 considerations	 along	 the	 same	 line	 of
thought.	 In	 this	 chapter	 we	 shall	 re-interpret	 rtaditional	 astrological	 elements
which	are	known	as	“nodes”	and	“parts.”	The	former	have	been	used	for	ages	in
India,	 especially	 in	 reference	 to	 the	 Moon.	 The	 latter	 seem	 to	 have	 been	 the
special	feature	of	Arabian	astrology.	Both	these	factors	serve	to	establish	points
of	relationship	between	the	planets	and	the	Earth.	They	refer	to	the	operation	of
personality	 as	 a	 unified	 whole	 and	 as	 a	 unit	 in	 the	 infinitely	 complex
interweavings	of	social	relationship.

### Planetary	Nodes

The	nodes	of	a	planet	are	two	opposite	points	where	the	plane	of	the	orbit	of
the	 planet	 intersects	 the	 ecliptic.	 As	 the	 ecliptic	 is	 not	 only	 the	 apparent	 path
described	by	the	Sun	on	the	celestial	sphere	(i.e.,	among	the	constellations),	but
“a	 plane	 through	 the	 center	 of	 the	 Sun	 through	 which	 the	 average	 orbit	 of	 the
Earth	lies,”	it	follows	that	the	planetary	nodes	represent	the	points	where	the	line
of	intersection	of	the	plane	of	a	planet’s	orbit	and	the	plane	of	the	Earth’s	orbit
meet	the	celestial	sphere	(i.e.,	the	“dome	of	the	skies”).	The	Sun	is	naturally	at
the	midpoint	of	this	line	of	intersection.

What	 is	 involved,	 therefore,	 in	 the	 idea	 of	 nodes	 is	 a	 type	 of	 relationship
existing	between	the	planes	of	the	planetary	orbits	and	the	plane	of	the	Earth’s
orbit.	The	sizes	of	the	various	angles	of	inclinations	of	the	planets’	orbits	to	the
ecliptic	might	be	taken	as	representations	of	these	orbital	relationships;	but	this
would	give	us	only	numerical	values	as	symbols—which	could	fit	into	a	system
of	 astro-numerical	 symbolism,	 but	 not	 into	 astrology;	 for	 all	 measurements	 of
astrological	 relationship	 must	 always	 be	 referred	 to	 the	 factor	 of	 zodiacal
position.	The	line	of	planetary	nodes	ends	in	two	points	on	the	celestial	sphere

which	 have	 zodiacal	 longitude;	 thus	 these	 points	 are	 taken	 as	 symbols	 of	 the
relationship	between	the	orbits	of	planet	and	Earth.

The	 reason	 why	 the	 orbits	 of	 planets	 are	 considered	 important	 is	 that,	 with
the	orbit,	we	are	dealing	with	values	of	motion.	The	plane	of	an	orbit	is	the	plane
of	periodical	motion.	And,	as	we	saw	already,	all	true	astrological	factors	can	be
abstracted	into	factors	of	motion.	Astrology	is	an	algebra	using	cyclic	motions	as
its	 symbols.	 (Cf.	 the	 chapter:	 “The	 Key	 to	 Astrological	 Symbolism”	 p.	 142.)
Thus	 the	planes	of	orbital	motions	 can	 indeed	be	considered	 as	 significant,	 the
significance	 being	 revealed	 to	 us	 by	 the	 zodiacal	 position	 of	 their	 line	 of
intersection.

The	 orbit	 of	 a	 planet	 represents	 the	 total	 cycle	 of	 dynamic	 activity	 of	 this
planet	in	relation	to	the	Sun.	The	Sun	stands	there	as	the	integrator	of	the	whole
system,	that	which	holds	it	together	and	represents	its	ultimate	total	significance.
The	 planet,	 of	 itself,	 symbolizes	 a	 particular	 and	 to	 some	 extent	 independent
mode	 of	 life-activity.	 But	 its	 orbit	 is	 a	 representation	 of	 this	 characteristic
activity,	 not	 as	 a	 thing	 in	 itself,	 but	 rather	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 Sun.	 The	 orbit
signifies	 therefore	 the	 integrative	 aspect	 of	 the	 planetary	 activity,	 viz.,	 this
activity	as	it	operates	definitely	within	the	organic	whole	and	for	the	fulfillment
of	the	central	aim	of	integration	of	personality.

What	the	relationship	of	the	planet’s	orbit	to	the	Earth’s	orbit	will	indicate	is
the	part	which	the	life-activity	represented	by	the	planet	occupies,	at	any	time,	in
the	 scheme	 of	 development	 of	 Earth-born	 mankind.	 If	 Uranus	 symbolizes	 the
regenerative	force	which	tends	to	bring	to	humanity	as	a	whole	universal	images
that	will	supersede	the	Saturnian	stereotyped	formula	of	separative	egoism,	then
the	 nodes	 of	 Uranus	 will	 tell	 us	 the	 manner	 in	 which	 this	 regenerative	 force	 is
operating	 at	 present.	 The	 indication	 given	 will	 be	 broad,	 and	 it	 covers	 a	 large
span	of	years	or	centuries,	for	the	planetary	nodes	move	very	slowly	along	the
zodiac,	 seemingly	 with	 alternately	 direct	 and	 retrograde	 motion.	 At	 present,
Uranus’	line	of	nodes	extends	from	Gemini	13.40	to	Sagittarius	13.40;	and	what
it	thus	stresses	is	the	fact	that	the	regenerative	force	of	Uranus	is	operating,	and
has	been	operating	for	centuries,	through	the	mind	of	man.

A	 closer	 analysis	 of	 the	 nodes’	 meaning	 will	 attribute	 opposite	 and
complementary	 significances	 to	 the	 two	 terminals	 of	 the	 lines	 of	 nodes,	 the
North	Node	and	the	South	Node.	This	nodal	dualism	is	logical,	for	every	type	of
life-activity	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 center	 of	 integration	 of	 the	 organic	 system	 may
take	 on	 a	 positive	 or	 a	 negative	 value.	 Integration	 and	 disintegration	 go	 ever

hand	in	hand.	Every	life-element	can	operate	as	a	destructive	or	as	a	constructive
agency,	such	being	the	universal	law	of	life.

The	 North	 Node	 is	 the	 positive	 pole	 of	 integration;	 the	 South	 Node	 the
negative	pole	where	disintegration	of	some	sort	(it	may	not	be	“evil,”	however)
takes	place.	The	former	is	a	point	of	ingestion	and	assimilation;	the	latter,	a	point
of	 release	 and	 evacuation.	 We	 shall	 study	 this	 polarization	 of	 life-activities	 in
greater	detail	when	we	shall	consider	the	Moon’s	nodes.	In	the	meantime	these
brief	 remarks	 will	 suffice	 to	 indicate	 the	 general	 opposition	 of	 meanings
manifest	in	the	two	nodes.

If,	therefore,	we	refer	again	to	the	present	position	of	Uranus’	nodes,	we	shall
see	that	its	North	Node,	being	in	the	fourteenth	degree	of	Gemini,	signifies	that
positive	 regeneration	 comes	 to	 mankind	 at	 present	 by	 the	 use	 of	 the	 concrete
intellect,	and	through	the	establishment	of	spatial	connections—which	are	two	of
the	essential	characteristics	of	Gemini;	also	that	there	is	an	integrative	Uranian
emphasis	on	the	development	of	the	nervous	system,	of	postal	communications,
etc.

On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 Sagittarian	 qualities	 of	 religious	 idealism,	 of
obedience	 to	 authority,	 etc—even	 of	 metaphysical	 abstractedness—are	 seen	 as
negative	from	the	point	of	view	of	the	planetary	Uranus	action.	They	constitute
the	“line	of	least	resistance;”	they	result	largely	from	past	habits	of	integration,
and	thus	constitute	most	often	“mechanisms	of	escape,”	from	the	psychological
standpoint.	 Nevertheless	 powerfully	 creative	 and	 Uranian	 releases	 may	 come
along	 Sagittarian	 lines	 through	 individuals	 who	 act	 as	 the	 culmination	 of
traditional	 impulses	 to	 activity,	 as	 the	 “last	 word”	 in	 a	 realm	 of	 achievement
which,	 having	 been	 thoroughly	 developed	 for	 millennia,	 may	 have	 nothing
compellingly	vital	to	offer—yet	is	able	to	produce	absolute	formal	perfection.

The	symbol	for	the	present	degree	position	of	Uranus’	North	Node	is:	“Two
people,	 widely	 separated,	 are	 communicating	 telepathically.”*	 This	 is	 most
significant,	 if	 we	 are	 to	 believe	 the	 statement	 often	 repeated	 in	 Alice	 Bailey’s
books	that	the	development	of	the	telepathic	faculty	is	the	most	important	task
now	 confronting	 the	 spiritual	 pioneers	 of	 the	 race.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 Uranus’
South	 Node	 is	 on	 a	 degree	 symbolized	 by:	 “The	 Sphynx	 and	 the	 Pyramids	 are
glorious	 vestiges	 of	 the	 past”—which	 emphasizes	 the	 fact	 that	 now	 all	 the
glorious	 past	 of	 mankind	 is	 being	 synthetized,	 recorded,	 brought	 to	 a
culmination	 through	 many	 types	 of	 human	 activities—from	 archaeology	 to
occult	 metaphysics.	 Yet	 this	 suggests	 also	 that	 dependence	 upon	 these	 past

glories,	national	or	religious,	is	most	often	the	result	of	shrinking	from	the	task
of	the	future,	and	is	a	form	of	escape	based	on	fear.

The	 following	 table	 gives	 the	 zodiacal	 positions	 of	 the	 planets’	 nodes	 for

### 1935.	The	yearly	variation	is	in	every	case	less	than	a	minute.

The	way	the	nodes	are	distributed	in	the	zodiac	at	present	is	most	interesting,
for	 they	 cover	 an	 area	 of	 less	 than	 90	 degrees	 North	 or	 South—in	 fact	 84
degrees,	which	recalls	the	Uranus	cycle	and	that	of	the	“building	of	the	Temple.”
It	 is	 especially	 interesting	 to	 see	 that	 the	 summer	 solstice	 is	 at	 present	 almost
exactly	 at	 the	 center	 of	 the	 configuration.	 This	 solstice	 is	 the	 time	 of	 most
intense	 solar	 manifestation	 (in	 Chinese	 philosophy,	 domination	 of	 the	 active
principle	 Yang);	 while	 the	 winter	 solstice	 is	 the	 point	 of	 lowest	 solar	 vitality
(domination	 of	 the	 passive	 principle	 Yin).	 The	 positions	 of	 the	 combined
planetary	 nodes	 are	 thus	 correspondent	 with	 points	 of	 solar	 dynamism	 exactly
analogical.	 This	 would	 tend	 to	 show	 that	 the	 integrative	 power	 of	 the	 solar
system	 as	 a	 whole	 upon	 the	 Earth	 is	 at	 its	 apex	 now	 (or	 close	 to	 it);	 for	 the
maximum	of	integrative	activity	of	the	planets	is,	as	it	were,	synchronous	with
the	maximum	of	activity	of	the	Sun,	the	integrator.	A	study	of	the	symbols	of	the
degrees	 on	 which	 the	 planetary	 nodes	 are	 found,	 as	 outlined	 in	 our	 preceding
example	 (Uranus),	 will	 be	 of	 deep	 interest	 to	 the	 student	 of	 contemporary
planetary	trends.

To	 the	 foregoing	 we	 must	 add	 that	 as	 planets,	 in	 their	 monthly	 or	 daily
course,	 reach	 the	 degrees	 of	 the	 zodiac	 on	 which	 their	 nodes	 are	 located,	 a
definite	stressing	of	their	positive	or	negative	characteristics	is	apparent.	When
planets	 pass	 their	 North	 Node	 they	 operate	 positively,	 actively;	 while	 at	 their

South	Node	point	they	are	receptive	and	passive—that	is,	the	quality	or	function
they	signify	operates	in	a	passive	(yet	strong)	manner.	In	an	individual	chart,	a
planet	situated	over	its	North	Node	is	very	dominate	psychologically;	its	effect	is
stirring	 up	 the	 consciousness,	 in	 the	 sense	 that	 all	 the	 integrating	 life-energy
received	 by	 the	 native	 has	 a	 tendency	 to	 relate	 itself	 to	 the	 particular	 quality
expressed	by	the	planet.	On	the	other	hand,	a	planet	situated	over	its	South	Node
may	 refer	 to	 a	 definite	 type	 of	 psychological	 escape.	 The	 native	 may	 tend	 to
evade	 the	 issue	 represented	 by	 the	 planet,	 or	 else	 to	 be	 passive	 and	 “let	 things
happen”	in	the	sphere	of	activity	which	the	planet	denotes.

A	very	definite	result	is	also	usually	to	be	noticed	(more	definite	probably	in
the	 more	 developed	 type	 of	 personality)	 when	 important	 planets	 in	 a	 chart	 are
located	 on	 degrees	 which	 are	 the	 nodal	 points	 of	 other	 planets.	 The
characteristics	of	the	latter	undertone	as	it	were	the	activities	of	the	former.	The
late	 King	 George	 V	 of	 England,	 for	 instance,	 had	 his	 Sun	 over	 Uranus’	 North
Node.	Undoubtedly	his	reign	has	been	full	of	Uranian	happenings.	Franklin	D.
Roosevelt’s	chart	is	also	characteristic	in	this	respect.	His	Jupiter	is	on	Mercury’s
North	Node,	and	Uranus’	North	Node	corresponds	to	his	Mid-Heaven.	Moreover
his	 Sun	 is	 on	 Neptune’s	 South	 Node.	 If	 Neptune	 represents	 the	 power	 of
collectivities,	Neptune’s	 South	Node	would	symbolize	that	power	disintegrated
and	left	to	follow	the	line	of	least	resistance.	Roosevelt’s	Sun	would	then	shine
in	the	midst	of	such	a	condition,	and	add	solar	power	to	the	Neptunian	element.
His	 own	 Neptune	 placed	 between	 Saturn	 and	 Jupiter	 (closer	 to	 the	 latter)	 is
symbolically	 between,	 on	 one	 hand,	 darkness	 and	 Saturnian	 “rugged
individualism”	 (to	 be	 regenerated,	 as	 it	 is	 in	 the	 eighth	 house),	 on	 the	 other,
Jupiter	and	the	power	of	expansion	and	circulation	of	energy.

An	even	stronger	effect	can	be	expected	where	the	line	of	nodes	of	a	planet
coincides	with	the	horizon	or	the	meridian	in	a	birth-chart;	or	even	with	the	line
of	 the	 cusps	 of	 two	 opposite	 houses.	 In	 these	 cases	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 planet	 is
strongly,	yet	subtly,	influencing	all	the	matters	related	to	the	two	opposite	(and
complementary)	houses.

### The	Moon’s	Nodes

While	 the	 Moon’s	 nodes	 are	 also	 produced	 by	 the	 intersection	 of	 the	 lunar
orbit	 and	 the	 ecliptic,	 and	 while,	 because	 of	 this	 basic	 fact,	 the	 significance	 of
the	 line	 of	 nodes,	 and	 of	 the	 two	 nodes,	 follows	 the	 general	 principle	 already
stated,	nevertheless	they	differ	from	the	planetary	nodes	in	many	ways.	First	of
all	 they	 are	 purely	 geocentric,	 and	 not	 heliocentric—being	 the	 nodes	 of	 a

satellite	 and	 not	 those	 of	 a	 fellow-planet	 of	 the	 Earth.	 The	 Moon’s	 nodes	 are
actually	the	points	where	the	Moon,	as	a	celestial	body,	is	seen	from	the	Earth,
passing	 from	 a	 northern	 to	 a	 southern	 latitude,	 and	 vice	 versa.	 In	 other	 words,
they	are	critical	points	in	the	relation	of	planet	to	satellite—as	critical,	let	us	say,
as	 the	 equinoctial	 points	 on	 Earth,	 which—by	 analogy—might	 be	 called	 the
“nodes	of	the	Sun”	(in	relation	to	the	celestial	equator	and	not	to	the	ecliptic)	and
which	are	definite	moments	of	change	in	the	relation	Sun-to-Earth.

Other	critical	moments	in	the	relation	Moon-to-Earth	are	those	which	mark
the	Moon’s	entrance	into	and	exit	out	of	the	realm	of	space	figuratively	bounded
by	 the	 Earth’s	 orbit;	 moments	 which	 correspond	 approximately	 to	 the	 last	 and
first	 quarters	 of	 the	 Moon.	 But	 these	 refer	 more	 particularly	 to	 the	 general
subject	of	“aspects”	between	celestial	bodies—a	subject	which	we	shall	be	able
but	barely	to	touch	upon	in	this	present	work;	or	else	to	that	of	the	“functions	of
linkage”	integrating	the	activities	of	astrological	factors	inside	and	outside	of	the
Earth’s	orbit—as	mentioned	in	the	preceding	chapter.

As	we	study	the	Moon’s	nodes,	we	are	considering	a	relationship	established
between	the	plane	of	the	Moon’s	orbit	and	that	of	the	Earth’s	orbit.	The	latter	is
centered	 around	 the	 Sun,	 like	 all	 planetary	 orbits.	 But	 the	 former	 is	 centered
around	the	Earth.	Thus	the	relation	Moon-orbit	to	Earth-orbit	translated	in	terms
of	the	relation	between	these	two	orbits’	centers	becomes	the	relation	Earth-to-
Sun!	But	this	is	a	new	type	of	Earth-to-Sun	relationship,	one	which	refers	to	the
innermost	 meaning	 of	 the	 possibility	 of	 adjustment	 between,	 on	 one	 hand,	 the
Earth-centered	ego	and	his	will,	on	the	other,	the	solar	Self	and	His	will.

What	is	seen	therefore	through	the	Moon’s	nodes	is	the	relation	between	the
“human”	will	and	the	“divine”	will,	between	the	conscious	efforts	at	integrating
an	ego-centered	personality	and	the	super-conscious	guidance	or	motivating	urge
which	 is	 working	 toward	 the	 realization	 of	 the	 total	 “cosmic”	 or	 divine
Personality.	The	former	is	largely	the	result	of	the	individual’s	conditioning	by
heredity	and	environment;	the	latter	is	the	true	factor	of	Destiny.	By	Destiny	we
mean	the	ordered	plan	by	the	actualization	of	which	as	perfect	a	personality	can
become	 a	 fact	 of	 life	 as	 was	 potentially	 contained	 in	 the	 seed-moment	 of	 the
individual’s	birth—viz.,	in	the	“monad.”

At	 the	 Moon’s	 North	 Node	 we	 see	 Destiny	 at	 work;	 at	 the	 South	 Node,
human	will.	The	lines	of	nodes	show	us	the	directives	of	Destiny,	the	purpose	of
Destiny—and	what	is	back	of	this	purpose,	in	the	past.	More	than	anything	else,
it	tells	the	“Why”	of	individual	life.	Why	the	particular	ego	was	projected	out	of

the	ocean	of	universal	Life—why	we	are	born	and	what	for.	The	line	of	nodes	is
a	 sort	 of	 “line	 of	 cleavage”	 which	 represents	 the	 first	 polarization	 of	 being.	 At
one	end	of	this	line	we	see	the	past	(South	Node),	at	the	other,	the	future;	what
the	personality	emerged	from,	what	it	is	meant	to	accomplish;	these	things	will
not	be	determinable	in	terms	of	concrete	events,	but	a	general	direction	will	be
made	clear—inasmuch	as	the	line	of	nodes	points	at	two	houses	in	a	chart	and
thus	at	two	definite	phases	of	selfhood.	A	positive	and	a	negative	pole	of	Destiny
will	be	determined.

The	way	in	which	the	individual	will	orient	himself	along	this	line	of	Destiny
will	 largely	 determine	 whether	 his	 life	 will	 be	 a	 success	 or	 a	 failure;	 or,	 more
correctly,	whether	his	accomplishments	can	be	tabulated	as	positive	or	negative
ones.	 By	 negative	 accomplishments	 I	 mean	 those	 which	 really	 belong	 to	 the
soul’s	 past,	 which	 are	 either	 a	 repetition	 of	 things	 so	 learnt	 that	 they	 have
become	 almost	 automatic,	 or
the	 breaking	 down	 of	 psycho-mental
crystallizations.	 Positive	 accomplishments,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 are	 things	 which
constitute	a	constructive	step	forward,	the	birth	of	a	new	faculty.

This	problem	of	orientation	along	lines	of	cleavage	touches	the	very	roots	of
astrological	symbolism.	We	can	never	understand	an	astrological	chart	save	on
the	basis	of	those	diametrical	relationships	which	link	opposite	houses,	and,	to	a
lesser	 extent,	 signs.	 The	 essential	 quadrature	 of	 a	 chart,	 the	 vertical	 and
horizontal	 lines	 formed	 by	 horizon	 and	 meridian,	 is	 the	 key	 to	 all	 the	 deeper
types	 of	 astrological	 interpretation;	 for	 here	 we	 deal	 with	 the	 most	 primordial
process	 of	 cell-segmentation	 and	 multiplication.	 Every	 growth,	 every
manifestation	of	life,	takes	place	along	certain	axes;	and	while	the	conventional
axes	of	space	(North,	South,	East,	West,	Zenith,	Nadir)	form	the	structure	of	the
development	of	 individual	 selfhood,	 the	 nodal	 axes	 (or	 lines	 of	 nodes)	 give	 us
the	directional	forces	of	Destiny.

This	 is	 true,	 above	 all,	 of	 the	 Moon	 nodes	 axis;	 but	 also,	 in	 a	 less	 obvious
way,	 of	 all	 planetary	 nodes.	 Every	 planet	 represents	 a	 particular	 quality	 of	 the
whole	 life-process,	 and	 thus	 a	 psychological	 function.	 The	 nodal	 axis	 of	 the
planet	 stands	 for	 the	 main	 line	 of	 stress	 in	 the	 development	 of	 that	 quality.	 In
more	trivial	terms,	things	will	happen	along	that	line—insofar	as	this	quality	is
concerned.	The	characteristics	of	the	two	houses	affected	by	this	“line	of	stress”
will	indicate	what	departments	of	life,	what	phases	of	individual	selfhood,	will
experience	the	strain.

The	 axis	 constituted	 by	 the	 Moon	 nodes	 deals	 most	 directly	 with	 the	 very

process	of	individuation.	Here	we	see	at	work	the	forces	which	try	to	integrate
the	particular	“I”	and	the	greater	Self;	the	faculty	of	assimilating	new	substance
of	 living	 and	 of	 rejecting	 the	 values	 which	 are	 no	 longer	 useful	 because	 they
have	been	shorn	of	all	that	was	of	vital	necessity	for	the	individual	personality.
We	may	even	go	so	far	as	to	say	that	there	we	have	a	line	of	metabolic	action,
not	unlike	that	tubular	channel	which	stretches	from	mouth	to	anus.	At	the	North
Node	 life	 is	 being	 absorbed,	 the	 substance	 of	 experience	 is	 being	 ingested	 and
reduced	to	assimilable	material;	at	the	South	Node	we	assimilate	the	contents	of
life,	automatically,	effortlessly,	and	eliminate	the	refuse.

In	this	 physiological	illustration	the	Earth	 stands	for	the	diaphragm.	 Above
the	 diaphragm	 is	 the	 North	 Node	 realm,	 below,	 the	 South	 Node	 realm.	 The
former	 represents	 the	 new	 foodstuffs	 and	 the	 active	 process	 of	 digestion;	 the
latter	 the	 old	 food	 now	 digested	 and	 being	 assimilated,	 turned	 into	 automatic
instinctual	activity—plus	the	rejection	of	unassimilable	residue.	Marc	Jones	calls
the	 Moon’s	 nodes	 axis	 the	 “fate	 axis.”	 But	 undoubtedly	 the	 digestive	 axis,
including	stomach,	bowels,	etc.,	is	the	“fate	axis”	of	our	body—a	real	fatality	for
most	of	us!

This	illustration,	however,	is	not	altogether	perfect.	In	a	more	general	sense
the	North	Node	represents	the	point	where	a	particular	entity	absorbs	or	receives
the	 substance	 of	 life.	 It	 is	 the	 channel	 through	 which	 the	 power	 of	 integration
(which	is	Life)	enters	the	Earth	and	her	inhabitants;	for	there	the	Moon	becomes
a	 vase	 into	 which	 this	 power	 is	 poured	 and	 from	 which	 it	 flows	 to	 all	 planets.
The	 South	 Node	 is,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 the	 point	 where	 the	 Moon	 becomes	 the
automatic	 distributor	(and	 ejector)	of	the	Earth-assimilated	force	that	was	once
solar.	 At	 the	 South	 Node	 the	 Sun	 and	 the	 Moon	 are	 absolutely	 unrelated.	 The
Moon	 scatters	 at	 the	 South	 Node,	 and	 focalizes	 at	 the	 North	 Node.	 Thus
integration	(at	the	North	pole	of	the	axis)	and	disintegration	(at	the	South	pole):
or	 indrawing	 and	 distribution.	 Progress	 is	 made	 at	 the	 North	 Node	 through
exertion.	Habit	is	established	at	 the	South	Node	through	automatism,	based	on
repetition.

If	 we	 should	 lie	 along	 the	 nodal	 axis	 we	 would	 look	 into	 the	 future	 facing
North,	and	accept	the	past	facing	South.	The	North	Node	deals,	therefore,	with
the	work	to	be	done,	the	new	accomplishment,	the	new	faculty	to	be	developed;
and	if	we	are	willing	to	exert	ourselves	in	that	direction,	from	it	we	shall	receive
power	 in	 abundance.	 The	 South	 Node	 represents	 the	 work	 that	 has	 been	 done,
the	well-known	accomplishment,	the	routine	performance	already	gone	through
many	 times,	 perhaps—the	 easy	 way	 out.	 Thus	 the	 opposition	 between,	 on	 one

hand,	 self-integration,	 individuation,	 effort,	 the	 line	 of	 greatest	 connection
through	exertion;	and	on	the	other,	self-undoing,	automatism,	inertia,	the	line	of
least	resistance.

The	South	Node	is	always	in	any	chart	a	wonderful	index	of	the	line	of	least
resistance,	 especially	 through	 its	 house-position.	 For	 what	 do	 we	 mean	 by	 the
line	of	least	resistance,	if	not	that	of	easy	performance?	Ease,	in	turn,	depends	on
prior	 repetition	 of	 similar	 performances,	 which	 repetition	 built	 as	 habit,	 or	 on
instinct.	What	is	easy	to	do	is	that	which	we,	as	reincarnating	individual	souls,	or
as	the	end-point	of	a	long	chain	of	hereditary	transmission,	have	done	before.	It
represents	 thus	 a	 past	 achievement.	 It	 indicates	 that	 an	 adequate	 and	 efficient
instrumentality	 has	 been	 built	 in	 the	 past,	 that	 a	 faculty	 or	 tendency	 has	 been
inherited	 at	 birth,	 for	 the	 acquirement	 of	 which	 we	 have	 not	 had	 to	 struggle
consciously.

It	must	be	clear	that	such	an	inherited	gift	or	instinct	is	not	evil,	and	therefore
that	 the	 South	 Node	 in	 a	 chart	 does	 not	 have	 of	 itself	 an	 evil	 or	 destructive
significance.	 If	 it	 has	 been	 called	 the	 point	 of	 “self-undoing”	 it	 is	 because	 we
have	so	often	a	way	of	following	the	line	of	least	resistance,	that	is	of	keeping	to
the	 thing	 already	 well	 known,	 to	 the	 performance	 in	 which	 we	 can	 display
ourselves	most	advantageously.	By	so	doing	we	refuse	to	progress,	to	move	on
to	 new	 achievements.	 We	 become	 slaves	 to	 our	 great	 natural	 gift.	 Instead	 of
using	this	natural	ability	in	terms	of	a	new	type	of	development,	it	“runs	away
with	us”—and	leads	us	to	our	own	undoing.	If	we	are	controlled	by	our	inborn
abilities	instead	of	controlling	them,	we	miss	the	main	purpose	of	our	life.

If	the	North	Node	is	a	point	of	reception	of	spiritual	power,	the	South	Node
is	 by	 no	 means	 a	 symbol	 of	 impotence.	 It	 is,	 however,	 a	 symbol	 of
maladjustment	to	new	conditions.	It	signifies	inborn	faculty,	but	usually	we	find
that	life	to	some	extent	forbids	us	the	use	of	that	faculty.	It	belongs	to	the	past	in
some	way,	and	unless	we	make	it	subservient	to	a	new	purpose	and	rather	rigidly
control	 it,	 it	 will	 hamper	 the	 correct	 growth	 of	 a	 new	 vital	 faculty,	 one	 which
represents	our	next	step.

On	the	other	hand,	when	we	consider	the	type	of	faculty	characterized	by	the
North	 Node’s	 position,	 we	 find	 that	 life	 forces	 us	 in	 many	 ways	 constantly	 to
develop	it.	Life	calls	for	that	power—and	is	willing	to	shower	it	upon	us	if	we
exert	ourselves	in	this	direction;	if	we	open	up	a	channel.	Every	effort	made	in
that	 direction	 will	 be	 usually	 well	 repaid—unless	 we	 stick	 stubbornly	 all	 the
while	 to	 the	 attitude	 represented	 by	 the	 South	 Node.	 We	 may	 do	 it

unconsciously,	 if	 we	 take	 care	 not	 to	 do	 so	 consciously.	 If	 so,	 a	 psychological
complex	is	bound	to	develop.	The	present	will	be	hopelessly	torn	between	past
and	 future.	 Then	 impotence	 will	 be	 the	 result.	 And	 we	 shall	 experience	 the
tragedy	of	“fate.”	The	past	will	have	to	die	before	the	future	may	live.	And	we
shall	 find	 ourselves	 deprived	 of	 our	 inborn	 gift	 by	 some	 stroke	 of	 Destiny,
because	we	had	become	identified	with	it,	lost	in	it,	“undone”	by	it.	Thus	truly
our	“self-undoing.”*

One	of	the	simplest	examples	we	could	give	is	that	of	the	nodes	in	the	fourth
and	 tenth	 houses.	 Here	 we	 have	 an	 opposition	 between	 home	 and	 profession,
private	 and	 public	 life.	 If	 the	 North	 Node	 is	 in	 the	 tenth,	 public	 life	 and	 the
profession	will	be	the	channel	to	self-integration.	The	South	Node	in	the	fourth
house	will	indicate	that	the	native	has	a	congenital	pull	toward	the	building	of	a
home,	and	this	may	cause	him	to	shrink	from	public	life.	If	he	shrinks	too	much,
his	home	life	will	turn	destructive.	It	will	disintegrate	in	his	hands	even	though
he	runs	back	to	it	yearningly,	hopelessly.	If,	on	the	contrary,	he	works	intently	on
his	professional	ideal,	he	may	be	able	to	make	of	his	home	(in	the	largest	sense
of	the	term)	and	of	his	own	concrete	basis	of	selfhood	the	true	foundation	for	his
public	life.

There	is,	however,	another	possible	interpretation,	according	to	which	public
activity	 and	 professional	 efforts	 are	 seen	 as	 generators	 of	 the	 energy	 which	 is
then	 released	into	 the	 sphere	 of	 the	 home	 or	 of	 the	 soul	 (fourth	 house)	 of	 the
South	 Node.	 This	 second	 interpretation	 is	 the	 more	 positive	 or	 spiritual	 one.	 It
explains	for	instance	why	a	great	genius	like	Wagner	had	the	South	Node	in	his
tenth	 house.	 He	 released	 publicly	 through	 his	 creation	 the	 energy	 generated
through	his	feelings	and	his	home	or	inner	life	(fourth	house).

The	 operation	 of	 the	 nodes	 is	 not	 always	 easy	 to	 detect	 by	 merely	 being
acquainted	 with	 the	 native.	 Most	 of	 us	 hide	 carefully	 the	 fact	 that	 we	 are
following	the	line	of	least	resistance.	We	hide	it	mostly	from	ourselves.	And	the
apparent	ease	with	which	we	may	perform	certain	types	of	actions	may	lead	us
to	 believe	 that	 we	 should	 keep	 on	 performing	 them.	 In	 some	 cases	 we	 should;
but	then	the	meaning	we	attribute	to	them	would	have	to	be	different.	Here,	as	in
every	case	dealing	with	a	spiritual	appreciation	of	behavior,	what	counts	is	not
the	act	itself,	but	the	motive	or	will	behind	or	within	the	act.

A	study	of	the	Moon’s	nodes	helps	us	greatly	to	probe	our	own	motives	as
well	 as	 those	 of	 others.	 For,	 confronted	 with	 many	 situations,	 we	 may	 put	 our
actions	 and	 reactions	 to	 the	 acid	 test	 of	 nodal	 polarities.	 Did	 we	 follow	 in	 this

situation	the	line	of	least	resistance	or	the	line	of	greatest	integration?	The	nodes
will	 tell	 us	 when	 we	 have	 the	 most	 chances	 of	 “fooling	 ourselves.”	 Possibly
even,	in	horary	charts,	we	may	be	able	to	find	quite	accurately	what	is	our	true
motivation	 in	 a	 particular	 instance.	 But	 the	 reading	 of	 horary	 charts	 in	 such	 a
psychological	way	is	a	rare	art	indeed,	which	but	a	very	few	will	ever	be	able	to
master.

### The	“Ascendants”	of	Planets

This	 often	 confusing	 subject,	 which	 introduces	 us	 to	 the	 still	 more	 general
concept	of	“Parts,”	can	be	readily	understood	if	we	re-state	in	a	slightly	different
manner	ideas	often	repeated	in	this	book.	We	know	that	the	Sun	represents	the
individuating,	 integrating,	 vitalizing	 power,	 which	 makes	 man	 whole	 on	 every
plane	of	being.	As	for	the	spatial	cross	formed	by	the	line	of	horizon	and	the	line
Zenith-Nadir	at	birth,	we	saw	that	it	constituted	a	symbolical	framework	for	all
operations	 of	 our	 individual	 being,	 within	 and	 through	 which	 human	 nature
operates	in	a	particular	way	which	characterizes	us	as	an	individual	being.	This
Cross	represents,	in	other	words,	the	exteriorization—in	a	structural,	functional
pattern—of	 that	 spiritual	 “quality”	 which	 is	 the	 supreme	 essence	 of	 man’s
individual	 selfhood.	 It	 defines	 the	 particular	 way	 in	 which	 the	 life-force	 of	 the
Sun	operates.

This	is	easily	understood	when	once	we	realize	that	the	zodiacal	position	of
the	Sun	at	the	moment	of	the	first	breath	represents	the	exact	point	of	the	Earth’s
orbit	 around	 the	 Sun	 where	 the	 native	 is	 born;	 whereas	 the	 Cross	 of	 the	 birth-
chart	determines	the	exact	moment	of	the	day	at	which	the	birth	occurred;	thus,
the	exact	stage	of	the	daily	rotation	of	the	Earth	around	its	axis.

The	 Sun	 in	 a	 nativity	 represents	 the	 dynamic	 emanation	 of	 the	 essential
quality	of	man’s	individual	selfhood,	because	it	is	the	motion	of	the	Earth	around
the	Sun,	involving	actual	displacement	in	space,	which,	symbolically,	generates
such	“essential	qualities.”	Each	of	these	“qualities”	represents	a	particular	aspect
of	life,	a	particular	relationship	between	human	nature	and	the	source	of	all	life
in	 the	 solar	 system.	 The	 Earth’s	 orbit	 (the	 zodiac)	 is	 the	 sum	 total	 of	 all	 such
possible	 relationships,	 therefore	 of	 all	 the	 different	 types	 (or	 Rays)	 of	 human
individualities.

But	while	the	Earth	moves	about	one	degree	on	its	orbit,	it	rotates	around	its
axis,	 presenting	 successively	 all	 parts	 of	 its	 globe	 to	 the	 light	 of	 the	 Sun—in
other	 words,	 vitalizing	 all	 parts	 of	 itself	 by	 bringing	 them	 to	 be	 fecundated	 by
the	significance	of	that	particular	Sun-Earth	relationship.	It	will	be	seen	thus	that

any	point	on	the	globe	(unless	too	close	to	the	poles)	receives	this	fecundating
impact	 from	 the	 Sun	 about	 365	 times	 in	 a	 year.	 This	 constitutes	 (with	 a	 slight
discrepancy,	the	meaning	of	which	will	be	discussed	later)	the	spiritual	reality	of
the	degree	as	a	division	of	the	zodiac.

The	point	we	wish	to	convey	is	that	there	are	only	365	(or	360)	basic	types	of
individual	selfhood	on	Earth,	each	the	result	of	a	particular	and	full	relationship
between	the	Earth	and	the	Sun,	symbolized	by	the	zodiacal	degree	of	the	natal
Sun.	This	full	relationship	is	not	instantaneous,	because	it	requires,	in	order	to	be
total,	 a	 complete	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth	 around	 its	 axis.	 This	 rotation	 brings	 all
parts	 of	 the	 Earth	 successively	 in	 direct	 contact	 with	 the	 Sun’s	 emanation	 (at
noon).	The	axial	Cross	in	a	birth-chart	defines	a	particular	phase	of	this	motion
which	distributes	the	Sun’s	power	through	the	whole	being	(psyche	and	body)	of
the	native.	In	other	words,	it	shows	the	hour	and	minute	of	the	day	at	which	birth
occurred.	 Moreover,	 it	 determines	 the	 structure	 of	 this	 whole	 being;	 for	 what
constitutes	 the	 particular	 individual	 being	 is	 the	 particular	 way	 in	 which	 this
solar	life-force	is	distributed	through	his	entire	organism.	This	“particular	way”
manifests	as	the	structure	of	the	organism.

The	two	axes	of	the	chart—and	especially	the	Ascendant,	which	symbolizes
more	 precisely	 the	 “uniqueness”	 of	 the	 individual-determine	 thus	 the	 essential
structure	 of	 body	 and	 psyche	 alike.	 Moreover,	 the	 relation	 Sun-to-Ascendant
represents	 the	 relation	 of	 the	 vital,	 individuating	 force	 in	 man	 to	 the	 structural
type	of	activity	which	characterizes	his	individual	selfhood.	This	relation	can	be
estimated	 not	 only	 by	 the	 position	 of	 the	 Sun	 in	 the	 houses,	 but	 also	 more
precisely	 by	 the	 distance,	 measured	 in	 zodiacal	 longitude,	 between	 the
Ascendant	 and	 the	 Sun.	 When	 this	 distance	 measures	 to	 especially	 significant
values	(as	for	instance	the	half,	third,	fourth,	fifth,	sixth,	eighth	of	the	full	360
degrees	 of	 the	 circumference)	 astrology	 says	 that	 certain	 “aspects”	 are	 formed
between	the	two	factors	considered—a	matter	which	we	shall	discuss	briefly	in
another	chapter.

We	 can	 extend	 this	 principle	 of	 the	 relation	 Ascendant-to-Sun	 to	 other
planets,	 because	 planets	 symbolize	 differentiated	 modes	 of	 life-activity.	 The
planetary	 power	 is	 distributed	 by	 the	 axial	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth	 to	 its	 entire
surface,	 just	 as	 is	 the	 solar	 life-force.	 The	 house-position	 of	 the	 planets	 has
reference	to	the	manner	in	which	this	distribution	is	effected.	But	if	we	wish	to
know	more	precisely	and	significantly	the	unique	character	of	this	 distribution
as	a	factor	of	the	native’s	individual	selfhood,	we	shall	have	to	determine	points
which	bear	to	the	planet	under	consideration	the	same	relation	as	the	Ascendant

bears	 to	 the	 Sun.	 In	 other	 words,	 we	 shall	 have	 to	 determine,	 by	 analogical
inference	or	by	a	sort	of	symbolization	of	the	“second	degree,”	the	“Ascendants
of	the	planets.”

What	this	procedure	leads	to,	when	generalized,	we	shall	see	presently,	but
for	the	time	being	we	shall	take	it	for	granted	and	see	how	it	operates	in	the	most
important	case:	that	of	the	Moon.	Our	aim	will	be	to	define	the	manner	in	which
the	Moon-power	is	distributed	through	the	organism.	In	order	to	do	that	we	shall
then	erect	a	symbolical	“Cross,”	which	will	be	in	relation	to	the	Moon’s	zodiacal
place	 as	 the	 cross	 formed	 by	 horizon	 and	 meridian	 is	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 Sun.
Especially,	we	shall	calculate	the	point	of	the	zodiac	which	stands	in	the	relation
to	 the	 Moon	 as	 the	 Ascendant	 is	 to	 the	 Sun.	 We	 may	 refer	 to	 such	 an	 abstract
point	as	the	“Ascendant	of	the	Moon.”	This	point	has	been	used	for	a	long	time
in	 astrology	 under	 the	 name	 Pars	Fortuna:	the	 Part	 of	 Fortune.	 It	 is	 found	 by
adding	the	longitudes	of	Ascendant	and	Moon,	and	subtracting	from	the	sum	the
longitude	of	the	Sun.

If	 the	 Ascendant	 represents	 the	 characteristic	 activity	 of	 the	 individual
selfhood,	the	Part	of	Fortune	will	thus	symbolize	the	characteristic	activity	of	the
ordinary	 ego-centric	 personality	 largely	 conditioned	 by	 feeling-reactions	 and
“lunar”	 moods.	 In	 the	 “Sabian	 System,”	 “the	 Part	 of	 Fortune	 indicates	 in	 any
chart	 that	 department	 of	 life	 in	 which	 or	 through	 which	 the	 native	 either
expresses	himself	to	the	best	advantage,	or	is	forced	by	life	as	a	whole	to	express
himself.”*	To	the	term	“native”	we	would	merely	add,	“as	a	conscious	ego.”	The
Part	of	Fortune	represents	a	man’s	congenital	activity,	as	a	merely	conscious	ego
—and	discounting	all	his	deeper	intuitions	and	unconscious	or	super-conscious
motives.	 It	 deals	 with	 his	 strictly	 personal	 reaction	 to	 life,	 the	 spontaneous
reactions	 of	 the	 conscious	 personality	 which	 he	 has	 built,	 or	 which	 life	 has
forced	upon	him.

In	medieval	astrology	the	Part	of	Fortune	was	said	to	represent	the	native’s
“wealth.”	According	to	E.	Parker,	where	the	Part	is	found,	in	such	a	department
of	 life	 will	 the	 native	 find	 his	 happiness;	 this	 especially	 in	 terms	 of	 house
position.	The	three	interpretations	are	quite	definitely	related.	For	man	is	happy
in	 functioning	 according	 to	 his	 spontaneous	 personal	 reactions,	 and	 both
happiness	 and	 spontaneity	 of	 personal	 reactions	 are	 usually	 much	 involved	 in
money,	 or	 at	 least	 in	 social	 cooperation	 and	 credit	 (of	 which	 money	 is	 the
symbol).

The	 value	 of	 the	 Part	 of	 Fortune	 will	 become	 very	 clear	 for	 instance	 to

anyone	 who	 has	 observed	 individuals	 having	 it	 in	 conjunction	 with	 Jupiter	 or
with	 Saturn.	 Here	 you	 have	 two	 types	 of	 basic	 conscious	 reactions	 to	 life:
optimism	and	pessimism—	modified	as	they	may	be	by	other	factors.	Here	also
you	 have	 on	 one	 hand	 a	 tendency	 to	 get	 credit	 and	 social	 cooperation	 for	 any
personal	venture;	on	the	other,	a	tendency	for	the	native	to	be	thrown	back	upon
himself	 constantly,	 as	 if	 a	 foreigner	 in	 a	 strange	 land,	 whose	 natural	 conscious
reactions	 to	 life	 are	 perhaps	 unfamiliar	 and	 bewildering	 to	 the	 collectivity	 in
which	he	lives.

The	same	procedure,	described	in	reference	to	the	Moon,	can	be	followed	in
reference	 to	 all	 planets.	 The	 “Ascendants”	 of	 all	 planets	 are	 significant	 and
worth	 studying	 in	 a	 refined	 type	 of	 astrological	 analysis.	 One	 of	 the	 most
valuable,	practically	speaking,	is	the	“Ascendant”	of	Uranus,	to	which	we	have
given	the	name	“Part	of	Imaging.”	It	indicates	how	the	image-projecting	power
of	 the	 unconscious	 operates	 within	 the	 individual’s	 being	 and	 Destiny.	 It
symbolizes	 the	 creative	 genius	 of	 the	 individual,	 its	 mode	 of	 contact	 with	 the
deepest	 sources	 of	 his	 being,	 and	 his	 reactions	 to	 such	 a	 contact.	 The	 Moon’s
“Ascendant”	 reveals	 conscious	 reactions	 to	 outer	 situations	 conditioned	 by
heredity	 and	 environment.	 Uranus’	 “Ascendant”	 characterizes	 unconscious,
creative	reactions	to	situations	affecting	the	entire	field	of	consciousness.

### The	General	Theory	of	Astrological	“Parts”

The	“Ascendants”	of	the	planets	are	determined	by	calculating	the	“arcs”	(or
differences	 of	 longitude)	 between	 the	 Sun	 and	 the	 planets,	 and	 by	 adding	 the
value	of	these	arcs	to	the	longitude	of	the	actual	Ascendant.	This	procedure	can
be	 followed	 in	 the	 case	 of	 any	 two	 planets—or	 even	 of	 any	 two	 astrological
points	previously	determined.	As	the	result	of	such	a	procedure,	if	carried	out	to
its	 limits,	 we	 can	 locate	 on	 the	 zodiac	 an	 almost	 infinite	 number	 of	 symbolic
points.	These	are	the	“Parts,”	used	so	extensively	by	Arabian	astrologers.

The	procedure	involves	two	factors:	First	the	factor	of	distance	between	two
planets,	measured	in	terms	of	zodiacal	longitude.	Such	a	distance	is	considered
as	 establishing	 a	 significant	 relationship	 between	 two	 planets,	 or	 any	 two
astrologically	 valid	 points	 of	 reference.	 This	 is	 the	 factor	 on	 which	 all
astrological	“aspects”	are	founded.	However,	“aspects”	are	constituted	by	only	a
few	 significant	 values	 of	 distance	 determined	 by	 dividing
the	 whole
circumference	by	the	use	of	simple	denominators	(2,	3,	4,	5,	6,	8,	10,	12	mostly)
—such	 as	 180°,	 120°,	 90°,	 72°,	 60°,	 etc.	 Yet	 theoretically,	 any	 distance	 is
significant,	 and	 this	 distance-factor	 is	 made	 even	 more	 significant	 if	 it	 is

### connected	with	the	Ascendant.*

This	 is	 just	 what	 constitutes	 the	 reality	 of	 the	 Parts.	 A	 Part	 is	 the	 distance
between	 two	 planets,	 referred	 for	 its	 significance	 to	 the	 Ascendant.	 The
Ascendant	 is	 the	 point	 of	 individual	 awareness.	 Therefore	 a	 Part	 gives
significance	 to	 the	 relationship	 between	 two	 particular	 modes	 of	 life-activity
(planets),	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 individual’s	 intuitive	 perception	 of	 life	 and	 Destiny.
Thus	 the	 Part	 of	 Fortune	 shows	 how	 the	 relation	 between	 solar	 and	 lunar
energies	 operates	 in	 determining	 the	 individual’s	 attitude	 to	 himself	 and	 to	 his
Destiny.	The	Part	of	Imaging	indicates	the	manner	in	which	the	integrative	(Sun)
and	 regenerative-transforming	 (Uranus)	 factors	 of	 his	 being	 cooperate	 in
enhancing	the	creative	individuality,	the	uniqueness,	of	the	native.

Put	 any	 other	 planet	 in	 place	 of	 the	 Sun,	 and	 the	 same	 principle	 will	 be
working	 out.	 Special	 meanings	 are	 released	 when	 the	 two	 planets	 considered
form	 a	 positive-negative	 pair:	 Saturn-Moon,	 Jupiter-Mercury,	 Mars-Venus.
Others,	 where	 antagonistic	 life-activities	 are	 concerned;	 the	 most	 significant
being	 the	 case	 of	 Jupiter	 and	 Saturn.	 Not	 only	 planets,	 but	 such	 astrological
points	as	the	“New	Moon	before	birth,”	can	be	paired,	and	their	distance	related
to	the	Ascendant,	thus	constituting	Parts.	Parts	reveal	meanings	in	terms	of	their
house,	 first	 and	 foremost,	 and	 also	 their	 sign	 and	 degree	 position,	 in	 terms	 of
their	 conjunctions	 with	 other	 planets.	 They	 are	 “sensitive	 points”	 in	 a	 chart.
Only,	 so	 many	 of	 them	 are	 possible	 that	 their	 number	 detracts	 from	 their
significance.

This	number	is	increased	tremendously	by	the	fact	that	the	distance	between
two	 planets	 can	 be	 related	 (added)	 not	 only	 to	 the	 Ascendant,	 but	 also	 to	 the
Mid-Heaven,	Descendant	and	Nadir	(or	Imum	Coeli).	Each	of	these	four	points
represents	a	function	of	selfhood,	and	therefore	is	entitled	to	become	a	center	of
reference	 for	 combinations	 of	 planetary	 activities.	 And	 this	 is	 not	 all!	 When
considering	the	distance	between	two	points	of	the	zodiacal	circumference,	one
can	 obviously	 get	 two	 arcs	 of	 measurement.	 Supposing	 that	 we	 measure	 the
distance	 in	 the	 direction	 in	 which	 the	 signs	 of	 the	 zodiac	 increase	 (counter-
clockwise),	then	we	can	measure	the	distance	from	the	Sun	to	the	Moon;	but	just
as	well	that	from	the	Moon	to	the	Sun.	In	the	following	illustration	we	count	25
degrees	from	Sun	to	Moon,	and	therefore	335	degrees	from	Moon	to	Sun.	If	we
add	these	335	degrees	to	the	longitude	of	the	Ascendant	(or,	which	is	the	same,	if
we	subtract	25	degrees	from	its	longitude),	we	get	a	new	Part	of	Fortune	as	far
above	the	horizon	as	the	original	Part	was	below	the	horizon.	And	if	we	operate

likewise	with	regard	to	the	four	angles,	we	find	eight	symbolic	points	created	by
the	relationship	Sun-Moon!

The	 astrology	 of	 Parts	 is	 indeed	 a	 kind	 of	 “group-algebra”	 working	 out
nearly	 endless	 correlations	 and	 permutations	 between	 the	 original	 elements	 of
the	birth-formula.	Its	complexity	makes	it,	of	course,	most	unwieldy;	yet	there	is
no	 doubt	 that	 it	 represents	 the	 ultimate	 and	 most	 abstract	 type	 of	 astrological
thought—that	 by	 means	 of	 which	 we	 come	 most	 closely	 to	 life	 itself	 and	 its
multifarious	 network	 of	 relationships.	 Think	 for	 a	 moment	 of	 the	 myriads	 of
nerve-tracts	 in	 a	 human	 body,	 each	 one	 establishing	 a	 path	 of	 linkage	 between
cells	 of	 various	 kinds.	 Sensations,	 reactions,	 volitions,	 feelings,	 instincts,
thoughts,	 all	 travel	 along	 this	 unbelievably	 complex	 web	 of	 life-threads.
Personality	is	the	result.	And	if	we	are	to	approximate	with	our	tools	for	analysis
the	infinite	variety	of	the	connections	to	be	analyzed,	it	is	obvious	that	nothing
short	of	the	multitudes	of	Parts	can	do	the	work.	The	vistas	open	are	vast	almost
beyond	 comprehension,	 for	 personality	 is	 ubiquitous.	 Astrology	 studies	 the
personality	 of	 every	 minute	 of	 life,	 of	 every	 situation;	 of	 nations	 as	 well	 as	 of
individuals.	It	is	indeed	the	algebra	of	multiudinous	and	protean	Life.

The	 eight	 possible	 points	 interpreting	 as	 “Parts”	 the	 relation	 Sun	 to	 Moon—in
two	directions	and	applied	to	each	of	the	four	angles.

## DEGREES	OF	THE	ZODIAC	AND	THE	“SABIAN”
## SYMBOLS

The	 Degree	 is	 not	 merely	 a	 subdivision	 of	 the	 zodiacal	 sign,	 or	 of	 the	 whole
zodiac.	It	stands,	as	an	astrological	element,	alone	and	in	a	position	of	supreme
(though	 little	 understood)	 significance.	 The	 Degree	 is	 the	 most	 mysterious
element	in	astrology,	and	indeed	the	key	to	all	deeper	astrological	interpretation.
For	in	the	Degree	come	to	a	point	of	synthesis	the	two	motions	of	the	Earth—
and,	symbolically,	the	two	great	principles	of	all	life:	collective	and	individual,
universal	and	particular.	In	the	Degree	we	witness	the	operation	of	the	creative
within	an	individual	personality,	or	a	particular	situation.	Here	“meaning”	stands
revealed—	for	whosoever	knows	how	to	read	symbols.

Ignoring	for	the	time	being	the	numerical	discrepancy	existing	between	the
365	days	and	the	360	Degrees,	we	see	that	the	Degree	is	the	space	covered	by
the	Earth	in	its	orbital	revolution	while	it	effects	a	complete	axial	rotation.	The
Degree	 is	 thus	 the	 projection	 in	 space	 of	 the	 time-unit,	 the	 day.	 In	 the	 Degree,
time-value	and	space-value	are	integrated,	and	the	two	motions	of	the	Earth	are
combined.	 Every	 complete	 axial	 rotation	 distributes	 all	 over	 the	 Earth	 some
phase	of	the	Life-function	related	to	the	zodiacal	sign	(or	segment	of	the	Earth-
orbit)	 in	 which	 this	 particular	 rotation	 occurs.	 Because	 the	 Earth	 moves	 on	 its
orbit	while	rotating	around	its	axis,	there	can	be	only	a	limited	number	of	axial
rotations	 within	 the	 yearly	 revolution	 around	 the	 Sun.	 Each	 rotation	 generates
thus,	orbitally,	a	Degree.	These	Degrees	are	not	mere	subdivisions	of	the	zodiac;
for	the	fact	of	their	existence	is	not	dependent	upon	any	intrinsic	differentiation
caused	 by	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 zodiac	 itself,	 or	 of	 the	 universal	 Life-force.	 It	 is
dependent	solely	on	the	axial	rotation	of	the	Earth.	The	Degree	partakes	thus	of
two	 natures.	 It	 is	 an	 orbital	 element	 conditioned	 by	 the	 axial	 rotation.	 It	 must
stand	therefore	for	that	factor	in	life	which	“reconciles	the	opposites.”

What	 this	 function	 of	 reconciliation	 of	 the	 opposites	 is	 can	 be	 ascertained

from	 our	 previous	 study	 of	 Jung’s	 analytical	 psychology	 as	 well	 as	 from	 the
contents	of	 our	chapter	“Individual,	 Collective,	 Creative,”	etc.	 In	the	 “day”	we
see	 operating	 successively	 all	 the	 phases	 of	 consciousness—from	 the	 waking
state	to	the	deepest	sleep.	All	the	stages	from	clear	consciousness	to	the	deepest
unconsciousness	 are	 theoretically	 present.	 But	 if	 a	 “day”	 is	 a	 basic	 cycle	 of
being,	 there	 must	 be	 something	 which	 integrates	 all	 these	 stages,	 a	 function	 of
relation	between	conscious	and	unconscious.	This	function	manifests	in	various
ways;	mainly,	on	one	hand	in	dreams,	on	the	other	in	creative	phantasy.	In	the
former,	 the	 unconscious	 predominates;	 in	 the	 latter,	 the	 conscious.	 But	 in	 both
cases	we	find	a	linking	or	integrating	process	at	work;	and	this	process	manifests
through	 the	 projection	 of	 images,	 which	 are	 symbols.	 Dreams,	 or	 the	 greatest
inspirations	of	the	genius,	are	alike	the	products	of	an	integrating	process	linking
conscious	 and	 unconscious.	 In	 a	 sense,	 they	 are	 more	 often	 conditioned	 as	 to
form	 by	 the	 state	 of	 the	 conscious—as	 the	 Degree	 is	 conditioned	 by	 the	 axial
rotation	of	the	Earth—but	the	energy	with	which	they	are	endowed	comes	from
the	unconscious—the	Degree	is	a	part	of	the	zodiac.

It	 might	 be	 said	 that	 the	 planet	 Uranus	 (and,	 in	 another	 way,	 also	 Jupiter)
symbolizes	this	activity	of	the	unconscious	in	relation	to	the	conscious;	but	what
a	 planet	 represents	 is	 pure	 activity.	 Whether	 the	 individual	 extracts	 out	 of	 the
activity	the	“jewel	of	significance”	or	not,	the	planet	of	itself	does	not	reveal;	nor
does	it	indicate	the	particular	quality	of	the	meaning	that	the	individual	at	best
could	extract	from	the	completion	of	this	activity;	that	is,	the	nature	of	the	“jewel
of	significance.”

What	 is	 seen	 in	 the	 Degree	 is	 the	 archetypal	 “quality”	 of	 whatever	 occurs
within	 its	 boundaries;	 the	 potential	 selfhood	 of	 any	 life-manifestation	 focused
therein.	The	zodiac,	considered	as	a	complete	cyclic	series	of	Degrees,	becomes
much	more	than	a	representation	of	collective	energies.	It	becomes	the	universal
womb	of	significances.	It	becomes	Time	in	its	highest	sense:	A	cyclic	series	of
creative	 moments	 which	 are	 “wombs	 of	 souls,”	 each	 of	 which	 releases	 a
“quality”	 that	 becomes	 the	 “monad”	 of	 every	 entity	 reaching	 independent
existence	within	that	moment.	Time,	thus	understood,	is	identical	with	the	great
Chinese	 concept	 of	 Tao.*	 The	 Degrees	 are	 units	 of	 creative	 Time.	 They	 reveal
the	boundaries	of	the	great	creative	“moments”	for	human	beings	on	this	Earth.

That	 there	 are	 360	 of	 such	 Degrees	 means	 that	 there	 are,	 from	 a	 planetary
viewpoint,	as	many	basic	types	or	modalities	of	individual	selfhood	on	Earth;	as
many	 “meanings”	 incarnate	 as	 “groups	 of	 human	 beings.”	 It	 is	 a	 planetary

number.	 There	 is	 a	 different	 number	 for	 each	 planet,	 and	 it	 is	 determined
(archetypally	 rather	 than	 phenomenally,	 as	 we	 shall	 see)	 by	 the	 relationship
between	 the	 durations	 of	 the	 planet’s	 revolution	 and	 of	 its	 axial	 rotation.	 This
relationship	 between	the	two	 durations	is	the	mystical	and	creative	meaning	of
Time,	as	we	understand	the	term.	It	is	the	operative	number	of	Tao	on	Earth,	we
might	say—very	much	as,	for	instance,	the	number	Pi	(3.14159)	is	the	operative
number	of	life,	universally	considered.

From	the	foregoing	it	may	have	become	clear	that	the	reality	of	the	Degree,
being	 of	 such	 a	 transcendental	 nature,	 can	 be	 considered	 and	 studied	 only	 in
terms	of	a	particular	symbolical	representation	attached	to	it.	Each	Degree	of	the
zodiac	must	therefore	carry	a	symbol;	and	this	symbol	will	reveal	the	meaning
—the	potential	selfhood—of	whatever	is	found	located	in	this	Degree;	whether	it
be	a	planet	or	a	cusp	or	any	other	abstract	point.

How	can	one	perceive	or	visualize	these	symbols?	The	answer	is	not	so	easy
to	give.	To	perceive	symbols	that	are	“wombs	of	significance”	one	must	have	a
faculty	 of	 spiritual	 perception;	 moreover,	 the	 power	 to	 make	 the	 images
visualized	 explicit	 and	 self-revealing.	 The	 term	 “clairvoyance”	 does	 not
elucidate	 much,	 but	 we	 must	 use	 it	 in	 this	 connection.	 Space	 forbids	 us	 to
explain	what	type	of	“clairvoyance”	we	are	referring	to.	It	certainly	is	more	akin
to	real	intuition	than	to	mere	“psychic”	gifts.	It	can	be	said	to	be	a	special	type	of
“holistic	 perception”—but	 one	 which	 is	 of	 planetary	 scope.	 Also	 we	 must	 add
that	 the	 revelation	 of	 the	 symbols	 may	 reach	 the	 public	 only	 through	 several
stages	 of	 transmission.	 Those	 who	 actually	 have	 such	 a	 planetary	 “holistic
perception”	may	transmit	the	symbols	to	disciples,	who	in	turn	record	these	for
general	use.

Be	this	as	it	may,	we	find	that,	in	the	Alan	Leo	Astrological	Manuals	series,
the	 booklet	 entitled	 The	 Degrees	 of	 the	 Zodiac	 Symbolized	 gives	 two	 sets	 of
symbolic	interpretations	of	the	Degrees.	The	first,	by	Charubel,	is	quite	valuable;
the	 second,	 from	 a	 medieval	 source,	 seems	 completely	 useless.	 Marc	 Edmund
Jones	 has	 given	 out	 another	 set	 which	 is	 by	 far	 the	 best;	 which,	 in	 fact,	 actual
practice	 has	 proven,	 to	 those	 who	 know	 how	 to	 use	 symbols,	 absolutely
invaluable.	The	symbols	are	presented	as	quite	modern	pictures,	thus	in	a	garb
more	significant	to	the	average	student	of	today;	but	they	are	said	to	be	derived
from	 very	 ancient	 Egyptian	 sources.	 We	 are	 adding	 to	 this	 chapter,	 with	 the
special	 authorization	 of	 the	 recorder,	 our	 own	 condensed	 formulation	 of	 these
symbols.	 We	 believe	 that	 they	 constitute	 a	 momentous	 astrological	 revelation,
the	 significance	 and	 import	 of	 which	 may	 loom	 larger	 and	 larger	 as	 the	 years

pass.

In	this	“Sabian”	cycle	of	symbols	we	have	something	similar	to	the	cycle	of
the	Yi	King	as	interpreted	by	the	King	Wen	some	3000	years	ago.	The	Chinese
seer	used	pictures	and	scenes	taken	from	nature	and	from	the	simple	agricultural
life	 of	 his	 day	 in	 order	 to	 convey	 through	 the	 instrumentality	 of	 images
otherwise	 inexpressible	 meanings.	 He	 had	 to	 use	 such	 pictures	 and	 scenes
because	unless	they	were	familiar	to,	and	easily	experienced	by,	men	of	his	time,
these	 men	 would	 not	 have	 been	 able	 to	 extract	 the	 vital	 significance	 locked
therein.	The	same	thing	is	true	today.	Therefore	the	“Sabian”	symbols,	recorded
by	 Marc	 Jones,	 present	 to	 us	 moderns	 pictures	 and	 scenes	 which	 are	 relatively
familiar	or	at	least	within	 the	scope	of	 our	vicarious	experiences.	It	is	possible
that	the	formulation	of	these	360	symbols	is	not	yet	perfect;	that	in	some	cases
the	scenes	depicted	as	symbols	are	not	sufficiently	deeply	rooted	enough	in	the
common	experience	of	mankind,	and	not	universally	or	vitally	compelling.	But
in	 the	 main	 we	 believe	 that	 such	 a	 series	 of	 symbols	 goes	 to	 the	 very	 root	 of
planetary	significance	for	our	present	era,	and	that,	after	being	refined	here	and
there,	and	after	its	structural	rhythm	is	made	clear	through	interpretative	studies
at	 various	 levels,	 it	 will	 stand	 with	 a	 significance	 comparable	 to	 that	 of	 the	 64
symbols	 of	 the	 Yi	 King	 series.	 At	 any	 rate	 its	 practical	 value	 in	 astrological
practice	 is,	 to	 us,	 absolutely	 beyond	 doubt.	 It	 has	 proven	 itself	 in	 hundreds	 of
cases;	in	fact,	practically	whenever	it	has	been	tested,	both	in	natal	charts	and	in
important	horary	charts.

We	might	add,	for	the	sake	of	a	fuller	understanding	of	the	matter,	that	there
are	 very	 plausible	 reasons	 why	 several	 valid	 symbols	 recorded	 in	 more	 or	 less
the	 same	 way	 by	 persons	 of	 different	 spiritual	 “qualities”	 could	 be	 attached	 to
each	 Degree.	 We	 must	 realize	 that	 in	 the	 realm	 of	 pure	 significance	 values	 are
very	different	from	those	encountered	in	that	of	intellectual	or	scientific	analysis.
First,	the	individual	element	is	paramount;	second,	it	is	connected	with	the	factor
of	time.	A	symbol	may	be	valid	now,	which	may	prove	valueless	a	few	centuries
hence.	The	matter	is	not	one	of	truthfulness	or	correctness,	but	one	of	value.	And
values	 are	 cyclically	 changing.	 A	 set	 of	 values	 may	 be	 “true”	 or	 rather	 vitally
significant	now;	also	it	may	have	been	as	significant	5000	years	ago.	Yet	it	may
have	had	very	little	or	no	validity	1000	years	ago.	For	the	same	reasons,	cultures
and	art-expressions	change	periodically.	There	are	cycles	of	significance	within
cycles.	 Each	race,	each	cycle,	 is	the	 symbolic	image	 of	some	 vast	planetary	or
cosmic	 meaning.	 Some	 men	 who	 strive	 after	 real	 spiritual	 values	 refine	 their
inner	 awareness	 to	 the	 point	 at	 which	 they	 can	 become	 the	 recipients,	 the

“grails,”	 into	 which	 flows,	 and	 into	 which	 alone	 may	 flow,	 the	 “wine	 of
significance.”	They	are	the	“seers,”	the	creative	geniuses	of	the	race—the	avatars
of	 Time,	 and	 themselves	 seeds	 of	 significance	 to	 the	 monadic	 group	 to	 which
they	belong	by	spiritual	right.

These	monadic	groups	can	be	discovered	by	means	of	astrological	analysis.
They	are,	in	a	sense,	hidden	behind	the	zodiac.	But	not	the	ordinarily	understood
zodiac	 of	 signs;	 rather,	 the	 more	 mysterious	 cycle	 of	 360	 Degrees.	 The	 key-
number	 in	 such	 a	 cycle	 is	 not	 12,	 but	 6.	 The	 cycle	 is	 one	 of	 awareness,
awareness	 being	 the	 vehicle	 for	 significance.	 As	 such,	 its	 first	 division	 is	 one
which	corresponds	to	the	concept	of	horizon;	and	also	to	the	theoretical	division
between	 day	 and	 night;	 which	 refers	 to	 the	 division	 between	 conscious	 and
unconscious,	outer	and	inner,	man	and	woman,	sensation-thinking	and	intuition-
feeling.	 The	 concept	 of	 meridian,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 refers	 to	 the	 element	 of
“power.”	 The	 birth-chart	 of	 the	 individual	 uses	 both	 axes,	 because	 birth	 means
crucifixion	in	space	and	the	number	4	is	the	number	of	formation.	The	ordinary
zodiac,	 symbolizing	 also	 as	 a	 whole	 the	 universal	 “power	 of	 formation,”	 had
therefore	to	be	divided	into	4	sections,	which	by	trisection,	gave	the	twelvefold
division—or	by	bisection,	the	eightfold	one.

Significance	 is	 based	 on	 the	 type	 of	 spiritual	 activity	 which	 constantly
“reconciles	the	opposites.”	It	is,	in	an	absolute	sense,	the	source	of	this	activity;
in	 a	 relative	 and	 concrete	 sense	 it	 is	 the	 result	 thereof.	 Its	 keynote	 is	 thus	 2
multiplied	 by	 3;	 the	 number	 3	 referring	 to	 the	 principle	 of	 essential
manifestation,	or	individuation.	In	other	words,	in	terms	of	significance,	we	find
the	 cycle	 divided	 into	 6	 phases.	 Each	 phase	 is	 the	 spiritual	 reality	 of	 what	 the
occultist-theosophist	calls	a	“Ray.”	Each	Ray,	as	it	manifests	concretely,	has	to
subdivide	 itself	 into	 4	 parts:	 the	 crucifixion	 of	 the	 Ray.	 Thus	 we	 have	 the	 24
Elders	 of	 the	 Bible,	 standing	 around	 the	 throne	 of	 God.	 In	 ancient	 times,	 as
manifestation	 was	 more	 potential	 and	 energic	 than	 concrete	 and	 actually
embodied,	each	Ray	was	rather	trisected,	giving	the	number	18—the	18	chapters
of	the	Bhagavad	Gita.	Krishna	was	the	nineteenth,	just	as	in	the	first	phase	of	the
Bahai	 movement,	 the	 Bab	 (the	 Herald	 of	 the	 Avatar-to-be)	 and	 his	 closest
companions	formed	the	19	“Letters	of	the	Living”—because	they	constituted	the
group	before	the	concrete	manifestation	of	the	“Glory	of	God”—Baha’u’llah.

The	 24	 Elders	 represent	 the	 24	 hours	 of	 the	 day,	 for	 the	 day	 is	 the	 unit	 of
Time	and	the	reality	of	the	Degree,	which	in	turn	is	the	unit	of	significance.	Each
“hour”	 stands	 therefore	 in	 the	 complete	 zodiac	 of	 significance	 for	 15	 degrees;
just	as	each	Ray	stands	for	a	two-month	period—or	two	successive	signs	of	the

zodiac	 (which	 are	 traditionally	 referred	 to	 as	 a	 masculine-feminine	 pair;	 for
instance,	the	pair	Aries-Taurus).

In	 his	 interpretation	 of	 the	 “Sabian”	 cycle	 of	 symbols	 Marc	 Jones	 refers	 to
these	 “hours”	 as	 spans,	and	 divides	 them	 each	 into	 three	 five-degree	 sections:
“In	each	hour	the	first	five	degrees	express	the	factor	of	the	habit	realm	in	man;
the	second	five,	the	emotional	realm;	the	third	five,	the	mental	realm—the	order
of	all	trisection	in	.	.	.	evolution	from	matter	upward	towards	spirit”	(Symbolical
Astrology:	Lesson	II.)

At	 this	 point,	 however,	 it	 seems	 necessary	 to	 answer	 two	 questions	 which
probably	 have	 presented	 themselves	 many	 times	 to	 the	 reader’s	 mind	 while
reading	the	last	paragraphs.	The	first	is:	If	there	are	over	365	days	in	the	year,
why	only	360	degrees?—The	second:	Are	there	not	seven	Rays,	rather	than	six?
These	 two	 questions	 can	 be	 answered	 simultaneously,	 the	 two	 answers
deriving	 from	 the	 same	 principle.	 We	 can	 state	 this	 principle	 briefly	 by	 saying
that	there	is	always	in	Nature	a	value	of	indeterminacy	where	two	fundamental
polarities	are	to	be	interpreted	 in	terms	of	each	 other.	The	axial	rotation	of	the
earth	 is	 a	 cosmically	 subjective	 and	 individualistic	 time-factor.	 The	 orbital
revolution	is	an	objective	and	universalistic	space-factor.	And	the	former	cannot
serve	 as	 an	 exact	 unit	 of	 measurement	 to	 determine	 the	 latter.	 We	 cannot
measure	 one	 set	 of	 values	 by	 a	 unit	 belonging	 to	 another	 realm	 of	 value.	 The
collectivity	 is	 not	 an	 exact	 sum	 total	 of	 individuals.	 There	 may	 be	 360
individuals	 in	 a	 group;	 but	 the	 value	 of	 the	 group	 is	 not	 the	 exact	 sum	 of	 the
values	of	each	individual.	There	is	in	any	collectivity	an	increment	of	growth,	a
plus;	a	mysterious	quantity	which,	in	a	sense,	is	not	a	quantity—at	any	rate	never
a	rational	number.

The	process	may	be	reversed,	and	one	may	say	that	the	individual	is	not	an
exact	fraction	of	the	group-value.	Life	is	not	as	mathematical	as	we	might	think;
and	 modern	 physics	 has	 discovered	 this	 while	 investigating	 the	 behavior	 of
electrons.	 The	 result	 has	 been	 Heisenberg’s	 principle	 of	 indeterminacy:	 You
cannot	 know	 accurately	 and	 at	 the	 same	 time	 the	 position	 and	 the	 speed	 of	 an
electron.	 Likewise	 no	 two	 planetary	 motions	 of	 different	 orders	 can	 be	 related
quantitatively	 by	 rational	 numbers.	 Perhaps	 the	 most	 universal	 symbol	 of	 this
law	of	cosmic	relationship	is	to	be	found	in	the	value	of	Pi	which	measures	the
relation	 of	 circumference	 to	 diameter;	 3.14159.	 It	 would	 seem	 logical	 that	 the
circumference	should	contain	3	diameters	or	6	radii.	But	it	contains	more	than	6
radii,	just	as	the	year	contains	more	than	6	X	60	days.

The	 “more”	 represents	 the	 coefficient	 of	 indeterminacy	 in	 all	 integrative
processes.	 It	 represents	 the	 freedom	 of	 the	 Soul,	 the	 Seventh	 Day	 of	 Creation,
the	Atman	of	Hindu	philosophy:	the	Imprevisible.	Occultists	speak	of	the	Seven
Rays.	 But	 the	 seventh	 is	 not	 really	 a	 Ray;	 it	 is	 a	 bridge	 between	 two	 sixfold
scales	of	being.	Musically	speaking,	it	is	the	“leading	note”	of	the	major	scale.	It
is	the	irrational	value	by	which	the	length	of	the	circumference	is	more	than	the
sum	of	the	lengths	of	six	radii;	that	is	.14159.	...	It	represents	the	freedom	of	all
Rays;	 that	 by	 which	 they	 can	 be	 more	 than	 they	 are.	 Likewise	 if	 one	 divides
365%	 by	 360	 one	 gets	 a	 decimal	 value	 which	 represents	 symbolically	 that	 by
which,	 each	 year,	 the	 individual	 may	 grow	 to	 a	 higher	 state	 of	 selfhood.	 This
value,	curiously	enough,	gives	again	the	number	14—being	.014+.*

In	another	sense,	the	extra	days	mean	also	that	the	Earth’s	orbit	is	not	perfect
nor	the	Earth’s	pace	steady.	This	might	be	referred	to	the	tilting	of	the	polar	axis
over	the	plane	of	the	ecliptic.	Whichever	way	one	looks	at	the	subject,	360	must
be	 taken	 as	 the	 archetypal	 number	 measuring	 the	 relation	 of	 individual	 to
collective	 on	 Earth:	 the	 creative	 number	 of	 the	 Earth	 as	 an	 archetype	 of
significance.	The	realm	of	significance	is	the	archetypal	realm;	and	no	concrete
manifestation	 is	 ever	 a	 perfect	 replica	 of	 its	 archetype.	 Likewise,	 no
astronomical	cycle	can	be	calculated	in	whole	numbers;	and,	we	might	add,	no
actual	life	is	ever	absolutely	and	rigidly	true	to	the	pattern	offered	by	the	birth-
chart;	no	group	of	prognostications	can	ever	be	absolutely	accurate.	Somewhere,
at	some	time,	some	discrepancy	will	always	occur.	Otherwise	the	universe	would
already	have	reached	a	point	of	static	perfection.	The	fact	that	life	is,	is	the	surest
indication	 that	 spirit	 and	 matter,	 significance	 and	 form,	 can	 never	 be	 perfectly
adjusted,	 and	 their	 opposite	 emphases	 never	 perfectly	 reconciled.	 Therefore
there	 must	always	be	destruction	and	regeneration.	Out	of	the	“indeterminate,”
the	 creative	 freedom	 of	 Shiva	 arises—the	 symbol	 of	 all	 transitions,	 the	 god	 of
the	 “First	 Ray.”	 All	 creation	 that	 is	 absolutely	 significant	 is	 imprevisible,
because	it	arises	out	of	relative	imperfection,	out	of	the	perpetual	need	to	find	a
new	form	to	integrate	the	unintegrable.

There	 is	 a	 great	 symbolic	 truth	 in	 the	 tradition	 that,	 in	 leap	 years,	 on
February	 29,	 women	 can	 propose	 to	 men.	 For	 that	 extra	 day	 symbolizes	 the
unfulfilled	part	of	any	cycle;	and	in	that	part	the	call	of	substance	unmarried	to
spirit	 rises	 to	 spirit.	 And	 it	 must	 be	 heard.	 And	 the	 answer	 is	 the	 Avatar,	 the
Christ-being,	the	Seventh	Who	is	the	First.

### We	 now	 give	 the	 “Sabian”	 series	 of	 Degree-symbols	 in	 our	 condensed

version.	 We	 shall	 add	 only	 these	 few	 remarks	 which	 are	 excerpts	 from	 Marc
Jones’	course:

“Symbolical	 astrology	 is	 a	 living	 art	 and	 must	 be	 studied	 as	 such.	 The
symbols	 connected	 with	 the	 degrees	 of	 the	 zodiac	 are	 seldom	 to	 be	 taken
literally.	They	are	rather	catalytics	to	the	astrologer’s	higher	understanding,
the	development	of	which	will	enable	him	to	add	content	and	implication	to
every	factor	of	life.”

Marc	Jones	gives	a	positive	and	a	negative	interpretation	of	every	symbol.	In
the	 present	 version,	 only	 the	 positive	 meaning	 is	 usually	 given,	 although
occasionally	 both	 meanings	 are	 mentioned.	 This	 dualism	 of	 meanings	 is	 the
expression	 of	 the	 fact	 that	 all	 being	 can	 orient	 itself	 toward	 spirit	 or	 toward
matter,	and	all	conditioning	is	susceptible	of	two	basic	types	of	interpretation—
which,	 in	 turn,	 can	 be	 related	 to	 one	 of	 several	 (at	 least	 three)	 levels	 of
consciousness.	 Hence	 the	 application	 of	 symbols	 to	 individual	 cases	 requires	 a
technique,	based	on	the	higher	understanding.

Any	fraction	of	a	degree	is	to	be	considered	as	a	whole	degree.	Aries	15°	o’
is	to	be	read	as	Aries	15°;	but	Aries	15°	1’,	as	well	as	Aries	15°	59’,	represents
Aries	 16°.	 The	 symbols	 are	 the	 expression	 of	 a	 span	 of	 activity,	 a	 cycle,	 the
significance	of	which	is	released	at	once,	the	moment	it	begins.

*	These	ideas	have	been	developed	in	the	first	part	of	this	book:	Cf.	p.	99	and	p.	108.

*	The	number	365¼	refers	to	the	solar	day	but	there	are	366¼	sidereal	days	in	a	solar	year.	One	can	take
either	of	these	two	values	according	as	one	considers	(1)	the	motion	of	the	Earth	along	its	orbit,	that	is,	in
reference	 to	 the	 Sun;	 or	 else	 (2)	 the	 cycle	 of	 axial	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth	 in	 reference	 to	 the	 fixed	 stars
(sidereal	day).	The	difference	is	subtle,	philosophically	speaking.	The	sidereal	day	refers	to	the	individual	as
an	individual;	the	solar	day,	to	the	individual	in	relation	to	its	spiritual	source	(symbolically,	the	Sun).

Form	 is,	 generally	 speaking,	 the	 element	 of	 being	 which	 defines	 the	 particular
out	 of	 the	 universal.	 Every	 particular	 manifestation	 of	 life	 has	 a	 form	 which
essentially	and	 spiritually	characterizes	it,	giving	it	a	determinable	significance
in	terms	of	the	manner	in	which	it	relates	itself	as	a	whole	to	universal	life.	Form
is	an	abstraction.	To	speak	of	form	as	a	tangible	reality	is	to	misuse	the	term	and
to	 confuse	 it	 with	 “body.”	 One	 of	 the	 most	 unfortunate	 practices	 in	 modern
Theosophy	 has	 been	 to	 use	 the	 term	 “form”	 where	 “body”	 was	 meant.	 The
confusion	is	apparently	rooted	in	an	old	distinction	current	in	Hindu	philosophy,
but	 which	 is	 most	 likely	 due	 to	 a	 faulty	 translation	 of	 words;	 or	 perhaps	 even
more	 to	 a	 misinterpretation	 or	 misunderstanding	 of	 the	 concept	 behind	 the
words.	Our	Western	mind	is	apt	to	materialize	the	metaphysical	concepts	of	the
East	 and	 by	 so	 doing	 to	 get	 involved	 in	 an	 approach	 to	 life	 which	 is	 not	 truly
integrative.

Form	is	an	abstraction.	It	signifies	the	essential	patterning	or	relationship	of
parts	 within	 a	 whole	 by	 means	 of	 which	 this	 whole	 is	 defined	 as	 a	 particular
entity.	 Form	 is	 a	 complex	 of	 relationships:	 a	 total	 formula	 of	 relationships	 of
parts	to	parts	and	parts	to	whole.	The	individuality	of	this	whole	is	thus	totally
defined	and	made	significant	by	this	form.

Body	is	unsubstantiated	form	and	incorporated	substance.	Form,	in	itself,	has
no	 substantial	 implications,	 though	 it	 is	 originally	 and	 in	 terms	 of	 life-purpose
determined	 by	 the	 need	 of	 the	 substantial	 elements	 which	 it	 correlates	 and
integrates	into	a	body.	Body	is	an	agglomeration	of	substantial	elements	(atoms,
molecules,	etc.)	which	is	made	relatively	permanent	and	significant	by	the	fact
that	it	has	form.	Form	is	abstract.	It	is	the	blueprint	of	the	skyscraper	defining	its
structure	generally	and	in	all	its	details	of	functioning.	The	completed	skyscraper
is	a	body—	substantial	and	tangible.

The	form	defines	the	significance	and	purpose	of	the	body.	One	can	conceive
of	 a	 realm	 of	 pure	 form	 inoperative	 and	 unconnected	 with	 substance	 or
materials:	a	realm	of	blue-prints	and	algebraical	formulas.	This,	in	a	sense,	is	the
world	of	archetypes	or	ideas—	except	that	energy	is	always	associated	with	what
are	called	archetypes	or	ideas,	whereas	there	is	no	energy	ordinarily	 connected
with	the	concepts	of	algebraical	formulas	or	blue-prints.	One	might	say	that	this
is	 the	 difference	 between	 idea	 and	 concept:	 The	 idea	 is	 vital	 and	 charged	 with
potential	life-energy;	the	concept	is	purely	intellectual.	The	distinction	might	be
the	 same	 as	 that	 between	 algebra	 (a	 system	 of	 abstract	 symbolism	 which
“works,”	 i.e.,	 which	 has	 been	 useful	 in	 interpreting	 data	 of	 experiences)	 and
algorism	(also	a	perfectly	logical	system	of	symbolism,	but	one	which	as	yet	has
never	been	useful	or	applied).

In	 this	 sense—which	 is	 not	 universally	 accepted—an	 idea	 is	 a	 seed	 at	 the
psycho-mental	 level.	 It	 is	 a	 seed,	 because	 it	 is	 both	 form	 and	 energy.	 The	 idea
will	eventually	germinate	and	become	a	body:	an	individual	organism	or	a	social
racial	 organism—a	 great	 human	 movement,	 an	 institution	 that	 is	 operative
among	men.	On	the	other	hand,	the	concept	is	a	mere	intellectual	structure,	form
as	yet	un-charged	with	life	energy.	A	concept	becomes	an	idea	when	a	being—
human,	 superhuman,	 or	 divine—identifies	 himself	 with	 the	 concept	 and	 pours
energy	into	it.

Thus	 we	 have	 the	 basic	 trinity:	 energy,	 form,	 substance,	 synthetized	 by	 the
fourth	term:	personality.	Personality	itself	is,	however,	the	ultimate	manifestation
of	 a	 more	 universal	 term:	 activity.	 When	 activity	 becomes	 truly	 creative	in	 an
individual	sense,	real	personality	is	born.	But	we	have	previously	used	the	term
personality	as	meaning	“a	pattern	of	human	behavior;”	and	so,	inasmuch	as	we
are	considering	primarily	the	psychological	aspect	of	astrology,	we	can	use	the
term	 personality	 as	 the	 fourth	 term,	 in	 which	 energy,	 form	 and	 substance	 are
synthetized.

In	 the	 preceding	 chapters	 we	 have	 studied	 the	 four	 fundamental	 factors	 in
astrology:	the	dial	of	houses,	the	signs	of	the	zodiac,	the	planets	and	the	degrees.
We	 pointed	 out	 that	 the	 first	 two	 factors	 were	 generated	 by	 the	 two	 primary
motions	 of	 the	 Earth,	 axial	 rotation	 and	 orbital	 revolution,	 and	 as	 such,
corresponded	respectively	to	the	individual	and	the	collective	elements	of	being.
The	degree,	being	a	synthesis	of	the	two	motions,	was	said	to	reveal	the	creative
element,	 the	 element	 of	 significance.	 We	 further-more	 referred	 to	 the	 planets
(considered	 in	 their	 totality	 as	 the	 solar	 system	 viewed	 from	 the	 Earth)	 as
indicators	of	personality.

These	 characterizations	 were	 made	 in	 relation	 to	 human	 psychology.	 But	 if
we	 wish	 to	 broaden	 them	 so	 as	 to	 include	 every	 possible	 manifestation	 of	 life,
we	 shall	 have	 to	 refer	 to	 the	 four	 terms	 above	 mentioned:	 energy,	 form,
substance	 and	 activity.	 Using	 now	 these	 latter	 terms,	 we	 can	 re-define	 our
fundamental	astrological	factors	as	follows:

The	 zodiac	 represents	 substance.	 It	 constitutes	 the	 substance	 of	 all	 life-
manifestations	on	Earth,	for	it	refers	to	the	varying	relationship	of	the	Earth	to
the	 source	 and	 origin	 of	 all	 life.	 The	 signs	 of	 the	 zodiac	 symbolize	 the	 twelve
basic	 types	 of	 life-substance,	 at	 every	 level	 of	 being.	 Substance	 stands	 for	 the
collective.	Every	astrological	factor	is	always	referred	to	the	zodiac,	just	as	every
individual	manifestation	of	being	is	born	out	of,	and	is	a	particular	combination
of,	collective	materials.

The	 dial	 of	 houses	 stands	 thus	 for	 form,	 for	 that	 which	 essentially
characterizes	the	“particular	combination”—i.e.,	the	individual.	While	the	zodiac
is	a	spatial	and	objective	factor,	the	dial	of	houses	refers	inherently	to	time	and
subjective	 values,	 to	 the	 form	 of	 the	 individual	 selfhood,	 symbolized	 primarily
by	the	“cross	within	the	circle”—the	familiar	astrological	wheel	being	a	further
differentiation,	 by	 trisection,	 of	 the	 basic	 mandala	of	 the	 soul	 (Cf.	 “Astrology
and	Analytical	Psychology,”	p.	100).

Form,	 however,	 may	 be	 considered	 either	 from	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the
individual	selfhood	or	from	that	of	the	active	and	creative	personality.	That	is	to
say,	 it	 can	 be	 represented	 astrologically	 by	 the	 relation	 of	 the	 Earth	 to	 the
zodiacal	space	surrounding	it—	the	Earth’s	magnetic	field;	or	by	the	relation	of
the	 Earth	 to	 the	 totality	 of	 the	 solar	 system	 surrounding	 it.	 In	 other	 words,	 my
particular	orientation	to	life	as	an	individual	is	a	subjective	factor.	It	is	the	way	I
realize,	I	feel,	I	sense,	I	think	of	myself.	It	is	my	point	of	view	on	life.	It	relates
myself	to	life.	The	form	of	this	relationship	is	given	by	the	houses.

On	the	other	hand,	as	a	human	personality	involved	in	actions	and	reactions,
living	with	other	personalities	in	a	vast	world	of	human	relationships,	I	also	have
a	certain	rhythm	of	behavior.	This	rhythm	is	my	personality;	and	it	may	express
exactly	my	individual	point	of	view	on	life—or	it	may	not.	This,	because	it	is	an
attempt	at	adjusting	or	balancing	the	individual	and	the	collective	factors	in	my
life;	thus,	a	sort	of	compromise—at	best,	the	integration	of	opposite	tendencies.
Astrologically	speaking,	this	complex	rhythm	of	behavior	is	symbolized	by	the
solar	 system	 as	 a	 whole,	 as	 seen	 from	 the	 Earth;	 which	 means	 by	 the	 related
positions	of	all	planets	(including	always	Sun	and	Moon)	in	my	birth-chart.	This

we	called	the	“planetary	pattern.”	It	gives	us	a	second	type	of	form—form,	not	in
relation	to	the	individual	per	se,	but	with	reference	to	personality,	or	to	the	term
“activity.”

Thus	 we	 have,	 let	 us	 say,	 subjective	 form—determined	 by	 the	 relationship
between	the	chart’s	axes	and	the	ecliptic;	and	objective	form—determined	by	the
relative	 positions	 of	 all	 the	 planets,	 and	 also	 by	 their	 positions	 relative	 to	 the
chart’s	 axes	 (horizon	 and	 meridian).	 We	 shall	 study	 briefly	 these	 two	 types	 of
form;	but	there	is	one	more	point	to	dispose	of.	We	have	considered	the	elements
of	“substance,”	“form”	and	“activity.”	Nothing	has	as	yet	been	said	concerning
“energy.”

Energy	is	the	factor	of	motion,	implied	in	all	the	other	factors	discussed	so
far.	Motion	is	the	energizing	principle	in	all	living.	It	is	at	the	core	of	zodiacal
substance	spread	in	collective	space.	It	is	the	power	of	unfoldment	at	the	center
of	all	individual	selfhood	born	out	of	the	womb	of	time.	It	is	the	vital	power	in
the	 maze	 of	 activities	 in	 and	 through	 which	 personality	 demonstrates	 itself.
Moreover,	 significance	 is	 born	 out	 of	 a	 combination	 of	 motions.	 It	 is	 as	 the
individual	 interprets	 the	 collective	 substance	 of	 all	 functions	 and	 all	 activities
that	 significance	 arises.	 Significance	 is	 symbolized	 by	 the	 “degree”	 which	 is
archetypally	 the	 amount	 of	 orbital	 space	 covered	 in	 a	 day	 by	 the	 Earth,	 the
amount	of	universal	substance	(zodiac)	assimilated	by	the	individual	in	his	basic
cycle	of	awareness	(cycle	of	the	Earth’s	rotation—day).

Significance	 is	 ubiquitous,	 but	 only	 as	 a	 potentiality.	 Every	 astrological
symbol	is	not	only	to	be	interpreted	in	terms	of	its	position	in	one	or	another	of
the	 zodiacal	 signs,	 but	 it	 is	 located	 in	 (or	 on)	 a	 degree.	 It	 has,	 therefore,
potentially	 at	 least,	 significance.	 But	 the	 realm	 of	 significance	 is	 not	 only
“individual,”	it	is	“collective”	as	well.	The	number	of	degrees	of	the	zodiac	is	a
finite	number.	And	this	number	characterizes	the	spiritual	status	of	the	planet	as
a	whole.	Significance	is	thus	a	planetary	factor	applicable	to	individuals.	It	is	the
gate	 through	 which	 the	 individual	 man	 enters	 the	 being,	 or	 be-ness,	 of	 the
planetary	 Individual.	 Conversely,	 there	 is	 an	 action	 of	 the	 planetary	 Individual
(call	it	Logos,	or	God)	upon	the	individual	man,	as	there	is	one	upon	collective
mankind.	 The	 latter	 is	 revealed	 in	 what	 we	 called	 the	 “Great	 Polar	 Cycle”—
ordinarily	named	the	cycle	of	the	precession	of	the	equinoxes;	the	former	might
be	 found	 in	 a	 symbolization	 of	 the	 “degrees”	 of	 that	 cycle.	 What	 is	 meant	 by
“degrees”	in	such	a	cycle	might	be	suggested	indirectly	by	the	subsidiary	motion
of	the	poles	(nutation)	whose	cycle	equals	the	cycle	of	the	Moon’s	nodes.

It	might	be	added	that	the	Moon,	and	those	cycles	of	energy	which	we	have
considered	as	“higher	Moons,”	represent	a	particular	aspect	of	energy	in	terms	of
the	“personality”	factor.	The	Moon	is	the	visible	symbol	of	those	energy-cycles
because	 it	 is	 the	 Earth’s	 satellite.	 Its	 revolution	 around	 the	 Earth	 represents
Earth-centered	 actual	 motion.	 Its	 phases	 can	 be	 seen	 to	 affect	 the	 processes	 of
life-growth.	 At	 higher	 levels	 the	 several	 “Moons”	 control	 the	 tides	 of	 psychic,
mental	and	spiritual	energy.

### Subjective	Form

What	 is	 considered	 under	 this	 heading	 is	 really	 the	 factor	 of	 the	 Earth’s
inclination	 upon	 the	 plane	 of	 its	 orbit,	 as	 it	 manifests	 in	 the	 birth-charts	 of
individuals.	 Because	 of	 this	 inclination,	 a	 house	 contains,	 in	 most	 cases,	 either
more	 or	 less	 than	 thirty	 degrees	 of	 zodiacal	 longitude.	 The	 crowding	 or
spreading	 of	 zodiacal	 space	 within	 the	 fixed	 framework	 of	 the	 twelve	 houses
creates	a	certain	type	of	form.	The	same	sign	of	the	zodiac	may	appear	on	two
successive	cusps,	or	there	may	be	“intercepted	signs.”	This	brings	out	important
elements	 of	 significance,	 which	 cannot	 be	 easily	 understood,	 however,	 unless
one	gives	more	attention	to	the	matter	of	cusps,	a	matter	often	misunderstood.

Referring	 to	 previous	 chapters,	 we	 need	 hardly	 emphasize	 the	 fact	 that	 the
“dial	of	houses”	is	to	be	considered	as	the	dial	of	a	watch	projecting	in	space	a
process	that	actually	occurs	in	time.	The	circle	of	twelve	houses	charts	on	a	flat
sheet	the	rotation	of	the	Earth	around	its	axis,	the	successive	changes	of	position
of	the	horizon	throughout	the	day.	The	two	opposite	cusps	represent	a	position	of
the	horizon	every	two	hours	as	the	Earth	turns	around	the	axis	whose	ends	are
the	North	and	South	Poles.	In	the	birth-chart,	the	line	formed	by	the	cusps	of	the
first	and	the	seventh	houses	is	actually	the	horizon	at	the	time	and	place	of	the
birth.	 The	 line	 formed	 by	 the	 cusps	 of	 the	 second	 and	 eighth	 houses	 gives	 the
position	of	the	horizon	two	hours	later;	the	line	formed	by	the	cusps	of	the	third
and	 ninth	 houses,	 the	 position	 of	 the	 horizon	 four	 hours	 later,	 etc.	 Thus	 the
contents	 of	 a	 house	 are	 the	 sum	 total	 of	 celestial	 phenomena	 reaching	 the
horizon	 during	 a	 two-hour	 period;	 and	 each	 cusp	 should	 be	 considered	 as	 the
Eastern	horizon—the	point	of	awareness	of	self—at	different	times	and	related
to	successive	phases	of	individual	selfhood	and	destiny.

Each	 cusp	 carries	 the	 basic	 significance	 of	 “Eastern	 horizon.”	 It	 marks	 the
beginning	 of	 a	 new	 period	 of	 awareness,	 and	 is	 a	 moment	 of	 primordial
significance	in	relation	to	everything	that	will	occur	during	the	period	it	initiates.
Each	cusp	is	a	moment	of	initiation,	a	birth-moment.	What	the	self	of	the	native,

the	“I	am,”	becomes	aware	of	during	that	moment	determines	the	significance	of
the	 two-hour	 period	 which	 follows.	 He	 becomes	 aware	 of	 a	 certain	 section,	 or
degree,	of	the	zodiac—and	the	whole	period	(house)	is	characterized	by,	“ruled”
by,	that	degree	and	sign	of	the	zodiac—and,	by	implication,	by	the	planet	whose
function	correlates	with	the	nature	of	the	sign.

In	 other	 words,	 at	 each	 cusp	 the	 “I	 am”	 is	 born	 in	 one	 of	 its	 aspects.	 This
cuspal	 moment	 is	 a	 seed-moment,	 a	 moment	 of	 transition	 from	 one	 stage	 of
being	 to	 another.	 The	 twelve	 cusps	 represent	 twelve	 great	 life-transitions,	 and
thus	 carry	 the	 meaning	 of	 those	 critical	 moments	 in	 life	 in	 which	 not	 only	 is
there	 a	 slow	 passage	 from	 one	 phase	 to	 another,	 but	 when	 something	 occurs
which	is	unique	and	which	partakes	of	the	meaning	of	“birth”	or	“seed.”

Such	“seed-moments”	are	creative	utterances	of	the	whole	individual.	They
are	 acts	 of	 manifestation	 of	 the	 self:	 creative	 acts,	 moments	 of	 freedom.	 The
individual	is	“free”	only	at	his	cusps.	It	is	only	during	these	moments	of	“life-
transition”	 that	 man	 is	 not	 conditioned	 utterly	 by	 the	 consequences	 of	 past
actions,	by	the	effects	of	previous	causes.	It	is	only	then	that	he	can	truly	operate
as	an	“individual;”	for	at	any	other	time	he	is	bound	by	the	group	or	collectivity
of	which	he	has	become	a	part.	He	is	geared	to	his	group,	bound	by	the	initiative
he	has	taken	during	the	cusp-moment	and	by	the	environment	he	has	chosen—
more	or	less	deliberately—in	which	to	work	out	this	initiative.	At	the	cusp,	the
individual	is,	as	it	were,	“in	neutral”—able	to	move	into	whatever	gear	or	speed
he	chooses.

For	 instance,	 at	 the	 cusp	 of	 the	 seventh	 house	 the	 individual	 chooses,
symbolically,	his	mate	or	partner.	The	cusp	is	the	symbol	of	his	initiative	and	of
his	 creative	 freedom	 in	 this	 particular	 seventh-house	 phase	 of	 life-experience.
Once	he	has	chosen,	he	is	no	longer	free;	he	has	to	work	out	the	results	of	this
initiative.	 The	 cusps	 of	 the	 eighth	 and	 of	 the	 ninth	 houses	 show	 the	 secondary
moments	of	choice	in	relation	to	this	matter	of	partnership.	At	the	former,	self-
regeneration	 is	 possible	 within	 the	 sphere	 of	 human	 relationship;	 at	 the	 latter,
self-expansion	and	broadening	of	life-perspective.

The	concept	of	cusp	must	be	extended	in	practice	to	that	of	“cuspal	zone.”	In
some	lives,	the	speed	of	life-transitions	is	great	and	changes	come	suddenly;	in
others,	the	transition	is	very	gradual.	As	a	result,	it	is	difficult	to	determine	the
exact	 dimensions	 of	 these	 cuspal	 zones.	 But	 in	 most	 cases	 they	 should	 not
encompass	more	than	three	or	four	degrees.	Planets	located	within	these	 zones
have	 a	 particularly	 creative	 significance.	 They	 emphasize	 the	 element	 of

individual	 freedom,	 and	 characterize,	 according	 to	 their	 own	 nature,	 the	 nature
and	 potentiality	 of	 the	 free	 operation	 of	 the	 “I	 am”	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 phase	 of
selfhood	represented	by	the	house.

Planets	located	at	the	very	beginning	of	a	house	are	“rising,”	from	the	point
of	 view	 of	 the	 cusp	 of	 this	 house,	 and	 represent	 initiating	 impulses.	 Planets
located	at	the	very	end	of	a	house	represent	fulfilling	qualities,	the	gathering-in
of	the	fruits	of	experience	related	to	a	particular	phase	of	selfhood.	If	within	the
cuspal	 zone,	 these	 planets	 indicate	 that	 the	 self	 will	 manifest	 creatively	 and
realize	 itself	 powerfully	 through	 either	 the	 initiating	 impulse	 or	 the	 fulfilling
quality,	as	the	case	might	be.

This	being	understood,	we	can	solve	the	problem	of	“intercepted	signs,”	that
is,	the	case	when	a	zodiacal	sign	does	not	appear	on	any	cusp,	but	is	sandwiched,
as	it	were,	inside	a	house.	When	a	sign	does	not	appear	on	a	cusp,	this	shows	that
the	 individual	 self	 of	 the	 native	 does	 not	 operate	 creatively,	 or	 does	 not	 reach
awareness	 through	 the	 life-quality	 symbolized	 by	 that	 sign.	 The	 native,	 as	 a
spiritual	 being,	 does	 not	 exercise	 his	 freedom	 by	 means	 of	 the	 power	 of	 that
sign;	 but	 he	 exercises	 it	 doubly,	 as	 it	 were,	 by	 means	 of	 the	 power	 of	 the	 sign
which	appears	on	two	successive	cusps.	By	“doubly,”	we	mean	in	relation	to	two
basic	phases	of	his	being	and	destiny.

In	 other	 words,	 great	 issues	 do	 not	 arise	 for	 him	 positively	 through	 the
quality	represented	by	the	intercepted	sign.	If,	for	instance,	Aries	is	intercepted
in	the	tenth	house,	the	impulsive,	pioneering	quality	of	Aries	is	not	a	life-issue	in
the	native’s	life.	He	has	no	choice	as	to	whether	he	uses	it	or	not.	He	does	not,	as
an	 individual	 self,	 express	 himself	 through	 it.	 What	 happens	 is	 that	 this	 Aries
quality	is,	as	it	were,	taken	for	granted	in	all	tenth-house	matters.	It	can	be	seen
operating	 in	 the	 background	 of	 all	 the	 public	 and	 professional	 activities	 of	 the
native—sub-consciously	 or	 instinctively.	 This	 may	 mean	 that	 the	 Aries	 quality
operates	as	a	psychological	“complex.”	It	may	have	been	inhibited;	in	this	case,
perhaps	 because	 of	 the	 father’s	 social	 position.	 It	 may	 have	 become	 the
substance	 of	 an	 “inferiority	 complex;”	 and	 this	 complex	 drives	 the	 native
powerfully,	yet	fatefully	and	perhaps	tragically,	toward	public	achievements.

Thus	 the	 Aries	 quality	 dominates	 tenth-house	 matters;	 but	 the	 domination
may	in	some	cases	be	an	almost	neurotic	one.	It	is	rooted	in	unconscious	factors,
factors	 over	 which	 the	 individual,	 as	 an	 individual,	 has	 very	 little	 control,	 and
through	which	he	neither	gains	real	awareness	nor	expresses	himself	creatively.
This	may	be	because,	in	past	lives	(if	such	are	believed	in)	the	individual	soul

has	gained	from	the	quality	of	the	intercepted	sign	all	that	could	be	gained—and
in	 this	 case	 the	 quality	 is	 built	 in	 in	 the	 new	 personality	 as	 an	 unquestioned
instinct.	 Or	 else	 it	 may	 be	 because	 the	 personality	 became	 formed	 under	 an
external	 pressure	 which	 inhibited	 the	 conscious	 and	 harmonious	 (spiritual)
development	of	the	quality,	and	a	“complex”	developed.

The	 outer	 results	 will	 be	 quite	 different	 in	 each	 case;	 yet	 what	 can	 be
ascertained	astrologically	is	the	fact	that	there	is	a	certain	fatefulness	connected
with	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 intercepted	 sign-something	 which	 is	 inherent	 or
subconscious,	 which	 operates	 with	 inevitability,	 and	 over	 which	 the	 individual
has	practically	no	control.	It	will	be	insistent,	if	not	pathological	or	tragic.	It	will
always	 mean	 a	 sort	 of	 disequilibrium,	 psychologically.	 But
this	 very
disequilibrium	may	mean	a	concentration	of	forces	which	will	drive	the	native	to
striking	accomplishments.	As	C.	G.	Jung	often	points	out,	a	“complex”	is	indeed
not	necessarily	“bad.”	It	is	often	the	means	whereby	the	individual	rises	above
the	 average	 and	 the	 norm.	 It	 spurs	 him	 on	 to	 heights	 of	 individual
accomplishment-provided	 a	 psychological	 adjustment	 is	 effected	 which	 is
individually	significant	and	steady.

If	the	quality	of	the	intercepted	sign	has	such	a	character	of	unconscious	and
fateful	 motivation,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 sign	 spread	 over	 two
successive	cusps	is	shown	to	be	one	of	decisive	importance	in	the	conscious	and
deliberate	 life	 of	 the	 native.	 Should,	 for	 instance,	 the	 sign	 Leo	 rule	 the	 second
and	the	third	houses,	matters	pertaining	to	both	these	houses	will	be	solved	by
the	 individual	 by	 means	 of	 the	 Leo	 quality.	 In	 dealing	 with	 his	 ancestral
possessions,	as	well	as	with	his	close	environment,	for	instance,	the	native	will
express	 himself	 and	 find	 himself	 through	 forceful,	 emotional,	 self-projective
assertion.

We	shall	study	in	a	later	chapter	the	matter	of	progressions;	but	we	might	say
here	that	whenever	the	progressed	Moon	(or	Sun)	or	the	“point	of	Self”	passes
through	an	intercepted	sign,	the	rhythm	of	life	(external	or	internal,	respectively)
is	usually	accelerated.	The	individual	faces	issues	that	are	deeply	rooted	in	the
past	and	which	are	compelling.	On	the	other	hand,	when	these	moving	indices	of
life-unfoldment	pass	through	spread-out	signs,	the	rhythm	of	life	slows	down	or
becomes	 freer	 from	 compulsion.	 The	 individual	 may	 seem	 to	 take	 a	 breathing
spell	and	to	go	after	one	type	of	thing	in	a	quieter	and	more	deliberate	way.

Such	 indications	 as	 are	 given	 by	 intercepted	 and	 spread-out	 signs	 have,	 of
course,	 to	 be	 modified	 by	 other,	 and	 often	 more	 important,	 indications	 derived

from	 planetary	 positions,	 aspects,	 etc.	 But	 by	 utilizing	 all	 the	 various	 elements
connected	with	the	cusps	the	intuitive	astrologer	may	read	the	spiritual	story	of
the	 individual	 in	 a	 way	 which	 probably	 cannot	 be	 duplicated.	 It	 is	 perhaps	 for
this	 reason	 that	 the	 exact	 degree	 of	 cusps	 is	 so	 hard	 to	 determine!	 For	 the
spiritual	story	of	an	individual’s	development	should	ever	remain	a	deep	mystery
to	the	superficial	investigator.

### Objective	Form

## A.	PLANETARY	ASPECTS

### The	first	condition	to	a	successful	grasp	of	the	subject	of	“aspects”	is	a	real

understanding	of	sphere,	circle	and	circumference.

It	has	been	said	that	“all	forms	reach	toward	the	condition	of	sphere”—that
the	 circle	 is	 the	 perfect	 form.	 If,	 however,	 form	 means	 the	 defining	 of	 the
particular	 out	 of	 the	 universal,	 then	 the	 sphere	 and	 circle	 (according	 as	 one
chooses	 to	 consider	 three-dimensional	 or	 two-dimensional	 being)	 are	 not	 to	 be
considered	as	“forms.”	They	are	instead	the	symbols	of	universal	being.	But	as	it
would	be	a	grievous	mistake	to	think	of	universal	being	as	“formless”—in	spite
of	the	fact	that	this	is	often	done—we	may	extend	the	concept	of	form	and	say
that	 the	 circle	 (or	 the	 sphere)	 is	 the	 “universal	 Form,”	 the	 summation	 or
culmination	of	the	evolutionary	series	of	particular	and	thus	imperfect	forms.

It	 is	 truly	 “universal,”	 by	 etymological	 derivation,	 because	 every	 point
thereof	 is	 “turning	 toward	 the	 one,”	 toward	 the	 center.	 For	 the	 convenience	 of
our	 analysis	 we	 may	 describe	 a	 circle	 as	 the	 total	 of	 an	 infinite	 number	 of
infinitely	 close	 circumferences	 having	 a	 common	 center.	 Thus	 we	 are	 dealing
essentially	 with	 circumference	 and	 center;	 and	 the	 circumference	 is	 a	 curve
every	point	of	which	is	equally	distant	from	a	common	center.	This	symbolizes	a
state	of	being	in	which	absolute	universality	of	viewpoints	is	attained;	in	other
words,	 the	 Universal	 Mind,	 the	 Perfect	 Personality,	 that	 men	 have	 called	 God.
God	 is	 not	 formless,	 but	 He	 is	 the	 equilibratedness	 of	 all	 forms,	 the	 total
harmony	 or	 integratedness	 of	 all	 viewpoints.	 A	 divine	 Person	 is	 a	 man	 who,
although	operating	temporarily	within	a	particular	form,	yet	has	so	equilibrated
his	 spiritual	 being	 that	 his	 “body	 of	 light”	 is	 a	 perfect	 sphere	 of	 being	 and
understanding.	 He	 has
the
reached—not	 beyond
disequilibrated	state	that	a	particular	form	implies—the	condition	of	“universal
Form.”	In	Gnostic	philosophy,	such	a	one	is	called	Eon	or	Sphere.	In	a	sense,	of
course,	 he	 is	 not	 only	 a	 “one.”	 He	 is	 an	 absolutely	 centered,	 integrated,

### form,	 but	 beyond

unanimous	Host.

But	every	one	of	us	is	a	host	of	lives.	It	is	so	in	a	psychological	sense,	and
the	psychological	Great	Work	is	that	of	harmonizing	and	integrating	the	“soul-
forces.”	It	is	so	also	in	an	even	deeper	sense,	for	our	physical	body	is	a	host	of
“lives”—and	in	the	perfected	man	(the	 man	of	the	“third	birth”)	the	individual
draws	 to	 himself,	 as	 to	 a	 center,	 this	 host	 and	 makes	 of	 it,	 as	 it	 were,	 the
substance	 of	 this	 “body	 of	 light”—the	 perfect	 and	 radiant	 Sphere	 of	 spirit-
substance.

If	we	now	proceed	from	the	universal	to	the	particular,	we	shall	see	that	birth
as	 a	 particular	 personality	 means	 establishing	 linear	 or	 angular	 disequilibrium
within	the	circle	or	sphere.	A	particular	being	is	one	in	whom	some	elements	(or
viewpoints)	 are	 emphasized,	 others	 subdued.	 He	 is	 no	 longer	 a	 “perfectly
rounded”	 individual,	 but	 an	 angular	 being,	 with	 points	 of	 stress	 and
concentration	of	energy,	and	zones	of	relative	emptiness.

This	particularizing	of	the	universal	(which	means	birth)	can	be	symbolized
accurately	 by	 inscribing	 a	 polygon	 within	 the	 circle.	 There	 is	 an	 infinity	 of
polygons	 which	 can	 be	 inscribed	 within	 a	 circle,	 some	 regular	 (with	 sides	 of
equal	length),	all	others	irregular.	Regular	polygons	are	geometrical	figures	such
as	the	equilateral	triangle,	the	square,	the	pentagon,	the	hexagon,	the	heptagon,
etc—having	 respectively	 3,	 4,	 5,	 6,	 7,	 etc,	 sides.	 If	 lines	 are	 drawn	 from	 the
center	of	the	circle	to	the	points	of	the	figures,	angles	are	formed	at	the	center.
The	 triangle	 produces	 three	 angles	 of	 120-degrees	 each;	 the	 square,	 four	 90-
degree	angles;	the	pentagon,	five	72-degree	angles;	the	hexagon,	six	60-degree
angles,	etc.

If,	on	the	other	hand,	we	consider	an	irregular	polygon,	such	as	the	one	in	the
adjacent	 illustration,	 we	 find	 it	 composed	 of	 a	 number	 of	 unequal	 sides
subtending	unequal	arcs	which	represent	unequal	angles.

If	 one	 should	 mark	 on	 a	 circumference	 the	 twelve	 signs	 of	 the	 zodiac,
considered	 archetypally	 as	 equal	 segments	 of	 the	 circular	 magnetic	 field
surrounding	the	Earth,	and	further	divide	each	sign	so	as	to	mark	the	degrees	on
the	 circumference;	 if,	 moreover,	 one	 connected	 by	 lines	 each	 one	 of	 these	 360
degree-marks—one	 would	 then	 have	 a	 regular	 polygon	 with	 360	 sides.	 This,
symbolically,	would	represent	the	perfect	form	of	a	being	still	identified	with	an
Earth-body.	 He	 would	 be	 a	 particular	 being—but	 one	 in	 which	 every	 “life-
quality”	possible	on	our	planet	would	be	equally	represented.

The	“God”	of	our	planet	(what	the	Theosophist	calls	the	“planetary	Logos”)
would	have	to	be	conceived,	however,	not	as	such	a	complete	polygon,	but	as	the
circumference	 (or	 circle)	 itself,	 considered	 as	 a	 complete	 series	 of	 arcs,	 each
having	 a	 universal	 significance.	 This	 would	 symbolize	 the	 universal	 quality	 of
His	total	being.	From	this	standpoint,	we	can	see	that	the	symbols	of	the	degrees
of	the	zodiac	are	attempts	at	bridging	this	gap	between	the	very	small	side	of	a
360-side	regular	polygon	and	the	arc	(segment	of	the	circumference)	which	this
line	 subtends.	 If	 we	 consider	 such	 a	 relation	 between	 line	 and	 curve	 at	 the
horizon,	we	have	an	interesting	symbol.	For	we	get	the	figure	of	a	bow,	the	line
of	horizon	being	the	arrow	shot	by	an	invisible	archer.	As	the	line	of	horizon	is	a
line	of	self-awareness	and	intuition,	we	have	a	graphic	illustration	of	the	eternal
effort	 of	 man,	 the	 archer,	 shooting	 at	 Space—the	 Universal.	 His	 bow	 is	 the
symbol	 itself,	 the	 taut	 string	 of	 which	 is	 the	 concrete	 image	 presented	 in	 the
symbol,	and	the	curved	wood	the	inner	and	universal	significance	of	the	symbol.
The	act	of	shooting	is	the	act	of	piercing	through	appearances	and	reaching	the
Universal	Self,	which	here	becomes	space,	the	circle	whose	center	is	everywhere
and	whose	circumference	is	nowhere.	This	symbol	is	an	ancient	one,	often	found
in	Hindu	philosophy,	and	embodied	also	in	the	symbolism	of	the	zodiacal	sign
Sagittarius.

In	an	ordinary	birth-chart,	if	one	links	by	lines	the	points	determined	on	the
ecliptic	by	the	position	of	the	planets,	one	obtains	an	irregular	polygon	with	ten
sides.	 This	 polygon	 is	 the	 “objective	 form”	 symbolically	 characterizing	 the
native’s	personality—as	we	use	this	term.	By	drawing	the	radii	linking	the	points
of	the	polygon	to	the	center,	the	angles	are	made	apparent	which	separate	each
planet	 from	 the	 others.*	 Such	 a	 polygon	 is	 what	 we	 have	 already	 called	 the
“planetary	pattern.”	The	task	of	the	astrologer	is	to	analyze	it	and	to	extract	its
life-significance.

Theoretically	 speaking,	 of	 course	 every	 angular	 value	 has	 its	 particular
significance,	just	as	every	degree	of	the	zodiac	has	its	particular	significance.	As
the	nature	of	the	relationship	between	two	planets	is,	in	this	phase	of	astrological
analysis,	 characterized	 by
the	 zodiacal	 positions
(longitudes)	 of	 the	 two	 planets,	 it	 is	 evident	 that	 an	 angular	 distance	 of	 92
degrees	is	as	significant	in	itself	as	one	of	90	degrees.

### the	 angle	 separating

However,	 just	 as	 we	 divide	 the	 Earth’s	 orbit	 (or	 magnetic	 field)	 into	 only
twelve	 regions	 which	 we	 call	 “zodiacal	 signs,”	 likewise,	 and	 for	 equally	 valid
philosophical	reasons,	we	use	only,	or	mostly,	for	the	purpose	of	form-analysis,
the	first	twelve	regular	polygons	and	the	angles	they	generate.	That	is	to	say,	we
assume	 that	 there	 are	 twelve	 (or	 even	 six)	 basic	 types	 of	 form-relationship
between	life-activities	symbolized	by	the	planets;	and	we	symbolize	these	types
by	 the	 angles	 produced	 by	 dividing	 the	 360	 degrees	 of	 the	 total	 circumference
into	 three,	 four,	 five,	 six—up	 to	 twelve	 parts.	 Two	 planets	 “aspect	 each	 other”
when	 they	 are	 separated	 by	 an	 angle	 measuring	 to	 such	 a	 value:	 for	 instance
120°,	 90°,	 6o°,	 etc.	 The	 list,	 names	 and	 characteristics	 of	 these	 aspects	 will
presently	follow.

It	is,	however,	necessary	to	add	at	once	that	with	regard	to	“aspects”	we	face
a	 situation	 not	 unlike	 that	 which	 we	 found	 while	 discussing	 “cusps.”	 In	 other
words,	we	must	extend	the	concept	of	“aspect”	so	as	to	make	it	signify	not	only
an	exact	angular	value	(90°)	but	an	“angular	zone”	(such	as	from	85°	to	95°).

The	exact	square-aspect	measures	to	an	angular	distance	of	90°.	But	two	planets
are	also	said	to	form	a	square	when	their	angular	distance	measures	to	any	value
between,	 say,	 85°	 and	 95°.	 This	 is	 true	 of	 any	 aspect,	 especially	 of	 the	 most
significant	ones.

Yet,	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 a	 deeper	 understanding	 of	 the	 factor	 of	 planetary
relationship	or	“personality-form,”	it	is	obviously	necessary	to	consider	not	only
“angular	zones”	but	each	angular	value.	This,	very	much	for	the	same	reason	for
which	 the	 substance	 of	 being	 is	 not	 sufficiently	 analyzed	 by	 the	 twelve-fold
differentiation	of	the	zodiac	into	signs,	but	often	requires	further	differentiation.

In	 his	 course	 entitled	 Pythagorean	 Astrology,	 Marc	 Edmund	 Jones
approached	 this	 problem	 of	 how	 to	 analyze	 all	 possible	 values	 of	 angular
relationship	 between	 planets	 in	 a	 strikingly	 original	 and	 convincing	 manner.
After	 studying	 the	 basic	 astrological	 aspects,	 he	 went	 on	 to	 analyze	 the
significance	of	the	degree	of	exactness	(or	degree	of	separation)	of	aspects.	If	the
angular	 distance	 between	 two	 planets	 is	 85°	 or	 95°,	 these	 two	 planets	 form	 a
“square;”	but	the	square	is	not	exact.	It	is	a	square	minus	or	plus	five	degrees.	If
the	 distance	 between	 the	 planets	 had	 been	 88°	 or	 93°,	 the	 aspect	 would	 be	 a
square	minus	two	or	plus	three	degrees.

If,	therefore,	one	should	allow	for	consideration	an	“angular	zone”	of,	let	us
say,	seven	degrees	on	 both	sides	of	exactness	of	aspect,	one	would	get	aspects
with	 a	 coefficient	 of	 inexactness	 varying	 from	 o	 to	 7.	 The	 value	 of	 this
coefficient	 is,	 according	 to	 Marc	 Jones,	 most	 significant,	 and	 characterizes	 the
manner	 in	 which	 the	 aspect	 itself	 operates.	 The	 matter	 is	 too	 complex	 to	 be
discussed	 here;	 but	 it	 was	 mentioned	 to	 show	 how	 every	 angular	 value	 can	 be
made	significant.

The	table	of	aspects	which	follows	will	make	the	matter	clear;	for	we	shall
see	 for	 instance	 that	 a	 “sextile”	 represents	 an	 angular	 value	 of	 6o°,	 the	 “semi-
square”	of	45°.	If	one	allows	a	7-degree	zone	on	each	side	of	the	exact	values,
one	 will	 have	 in	 fact	 covered	 every	 angular	 value.	 For	 53°	 is	 a	 sextile
“coefficient	 7;”	 and	 52°	 is	 a	 semisquare	 also	 “coefficient	 7.”	 By	 this	 method
every	angular	value	in	whole	degrees	is	given	an	individual	significance.*

Of	 these	 aspects	 the	 most	 commonly	 used	 are:	 conjunction,	 opposition,	 trine,
square,	 sextile.	 The	 semi-sextile	 is	 usually	 considered	 as	 a	 sub-division	 of	 the
sextile;	 the	 semi-square,	 a	 subdivision	 of	 the	 square.	 The	 quintile	 is—
unfortunately—little	used,	and	septile,	nonagen	and	one-eleventh	are	practically
never	found	in	modern	astrological	text-books.

All	 these	 aspects	 are	 generated	 by	 the	 inscription	 within	 a	 circle	 of	 regular
polygons—save	 the	 conjunction	 and	 opposition,	 which	 require	 some	 special
attention.	 The	 conjunction	 is,	 essentially,	 the	 prototype	 of	 all	 particular
manifestation,	 because	 it	 stresses	 the	 element	 of	 activity	 in	 a	 particular	 or
personal	way.	We	might	say	that	the	very	fact	that	a	planet	is	located	in	a	degree
means	that	a	conjunction	is	established	between	the	planet	and	that	degree.	The
degree,	 of	 itself,	 is	 one	 among	 360	 harmonized	 and	 integrated	 phases	 of
universal	 being.	 But	 when	 a	 planet	 comes	 to	 that	 degree	 in	 the	 chart	 of	 a
particular	 man,	 the	 degree’s	 quality	 suddenly	 becomes	 vivified,	 energized,
emphasized.	 The	 harmonious	 sequence	 of	 the	 360	 degrees	 becomes	 therefore
disturbed.	 One	 of	 the	 degrees	 acquires	 an	 accent	 Particularity	 of	 being	 is	 the

result	of	a	pattern	of	accents;	whereas	in	universal	being	there	are	no	permanent
accents,	 no	 structure-making	 points	 of	 emphasis.	 It	 is	 this	 fact	 which	 has	 been
misconstrued	as	meaning	“formlessness.”

In	 any	 chart,	 planets	 are	 points	 of	 emphasis,	 accents,	 releases	 of	 energy,
sources	of	activity.	The	significant	quality	of	the	energy	released	is	determined
by	the	symbol	of	the	degree;	the	type	of	activity,	by	the	planet.	It	is	this	element
of	activity	which	becomes	the	raw	material	of	personality.	Activity	means	stress,
tension,	 disequilibrium.	 Therefore	 every	 planet
represents	 a	 state	 of
disequilibrium	of	zodiacal	wholeness;	just	as,	to	use	Goethe’s	phrase,	“colors	are
the	 sufferings	 and	 joys	 of	 the	 light.”	 The	 zodiac	 is	 the	 equilibrated	 cycle	 of
wholeness.	Planets	introduce	disequilibrium,	differentiation,	sufferings	and	joys
—which	mean	accents	up	or	accents	down.

One	 planet	 located	 within	 the	 span	 of	 one	 degree	 creates	 an	 accent.	 Two
planets	 in	 this	 same	 location	 may	 either	 stress	 further	 the	 accent	 or	 blur	 the
directness	of	the	release	of	energy	implied	by	accentuation.	Everything	depends:
1)	 upon	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 planets	 in	 conjunction;	 2)	 upon	 the	 “co-efficient	 of
inexactness”	 of	 the	 conjunction.	 For	 instance,	 if	 two	 planets	 of	 opposite
polarities,	like	Mars	and	Venus,	are	conjunct	in	exactly	the	same	degree,	a	sort	of
psychological	short-circuit	is	indicated.	A	curious	kind	of	self-centeredness	and
emotional	 inertia	 is	 shown—which	 can	 produce	 an	 accentuated	 type	 of
narcissism.	But	if	these	two	planets	are	several	degrees	apart,	then,	while	there	is
a	 peculiar	 sense	 of	 self-reliance	 and	 often	 a	 sort	 of	 psychological
“hermaphroditism,”	this	contributes	to	emotional	self-control	of	the	type	which
is	found,	for	instance,	in	occultists.	There	is,	however,	always	the	suspicion	of	a
“complex”	 lurking	 back	 of	 every	 such	 conjunction	 of	 masculine-feminine
planets;	 it	 lies,	 in	 fact,	 back	 of	 every	 conjunction,	 especially	 multiple
conjunctions,	or	“stellium.”	But	it	is	often	through	“complexes”	of	some	sort	that
strong	releases	of	psychic	energy	are	induced;	perhaps	always	so.

A	 conjunction	 is	 a	 symbol	 of	 particular	 stress	 which	 releases	 activity—at
times	explosively,	as	in	the	case	of	conjunctions	of	Mars	and	Saturn,	Uranus	and
Saturn,	etc.	It	stresses	the	uniqueness	of	the	particular	being,	or	of	the	particular
activity	 implied.	 It	 does	 not	 make	 for	 spiritual	 equilibrium;	 but	 it	 generates
momentum	 of	 one	 sort	 or	 another.	 It	 is	 a	 concentrated	 massing	 of	 energy.
Whether	 that	 energy	 will	 be	 released	 constructively	 or	 destructively,	 whether
even	it	will	be	released	at	all,	depends	on	the	nature	of	the	planets,	and	on	the
actual	distance	between	the	planets	said	to	be	“in	conjunction.”

The	 aspect	 of	 opposition	 is	 the	 opposite	 of,	 and	 the	 antidote	 to,	 the
conjunction.	 Two	 planets	 in	 opposition	 are	 located,	 in	 terms	 of	 zodiacal
longitude,	 exactly	 in	 opposite	 directions	 from	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the	 Earth-
observer.	The	latter	is	therefore,	as	it	were,	subjected	to	two	contrary	pulls.	He
may	 be	 actually	 “pulled	 apart”	 by	 the	 opposition.	 But	 also,	 if	 the	 two	 opposed
planets	 are	 considered	 as	 two	 poles	 of	 a	 battery,	 he	 may	 be	 illumined	 by	 the
spark	flowing	from	pole	to	pole.	This	is	especially	so	where	the	two	planets	are
basically	of	opposite	polarities.

In	 order	 to	 understand	 oppositions,	 one	 has	 to	 grasp	 fully	 the	 meaning	 of
polarity.	 The	 Ascendant	 and	 Descendant,	 the	 Zenith	 and	 Nadir,	 in	 every	 chart,
are	points	in	zodiacal	opposition.	Consciousness,	which	is	integrated	awareness,
is	the	result	of	such	basic	oppositions.	Again,	all	depends	on	whether	or	not	the
individual	 has	 the	 power	 to	 “reconcile	 the	 opposites;”	 whether	 he	 will	 pull
together	or	be	pulled	apart.	If	the	former,	then	his	consciousness	will	expand	and
objectify	itself;	if	the	latter,	he	will	experience	psychological	confusion	and	will
not	 be	 able	 to	 know	 which	 way	 to	 go.	 And	 so	 he	 will	 sit	 and	 suffer,	 torn	 by
doubt.

In	 the	 opposition,	 we	 witness	 the	 more	 or	 less	 simultaneous	 operation	 of
accent	 and	 counter-accent.	 If	 the	 aspect	 is	 not	 exact,	 a	 quick	 rhythm	 is
established	 which	 can	 lead	 to	 intense	 objectivity	 of	 consciousness,	 almost
absolute	 awareness.	 But	 if	 the	 aspect	 is	 exact,	 or	 if	 the	 native	 has	 a	 very	 slow
“speed	 of	 reaction,”	 the	 counter-accent	 neutralizes	 the	 accent.	 It	 may	 mean
nirvana—the	 absorption	 of	 the	 particular	 in	 the	 universal—and	 the	 Buddha	 is
said	to	have	reached	nirvana	at	 the	 full	 moon	 of	 May	 (Sun-Moon	 opposition).
But	 it	 may	 mean	 also	 disintegration,	 schizophrenia	 and	 the	 like,	 thus	 the	 often
nefarious	meaning	of	a	lunar	eclipse.

Conjunction	and	opposition	can	hardly	be	said	to	create	form;	rather,	as	we
have	 seen,	 they	 produce	 accentuation	 and	 counter-accentuation,	 which	 are	 the
basic	phenomena	of	the	life	of	the	personality.	The	other	aspects	will,	as	it	were,
distribute	 the	 idea	 of	 accent	 or	 emphasis;	 and	 will	 thus	 convey	 the	 idea	 of
purpose.	There	will	be	accentuation	or	counter-accentuation,	tending	toward	this
or	 that	 purpose.	 The	 purpose	 itself	 will	 be	 fulfilled	 if	 the	 aspects	 involve	 the
completion	of	the	polygonal	form	which	is	the	foundation	of	the	aspect;	that	is	to
say.	if	configurations	named	“Grand	trine”	and	“Great	Cross”—or	the	very	rare
“Great	quintile”	and	“Grand	sextile”—are	formed,	as	we	shall	see	later	on.

### What	is	meant	will	be	easily	grasped	if	we	realize	that	the	polygonal	forms

with	which	we	ordinarily	deal	in	astrology	are	based	either	on	the	triangle	or	on
the	square.	Trine,	sextile,	semi-sextile	(and	quincunx)	are	essentially	triangular;
square	and	semi-square	(and	sesquiquadrate)	are	quadrangular.	The	first	series	is
usually	 considered	 “fortunate;”	 the	 second	 “unfortunate.”	 But	 such	 an	 ethical
valuation,	 which	 finds	 its	 full	 meaning	 in	 “horary	 astrology,”	 is	 almost	 out	 of
place	 in	 the	 type	 of	 astrology	 which	 we	 are	 more	 particularly	 studying.	 In	 its
stead	we	shall	use	another	classification	of	meanings,	and	say	that	the	triangular
series	deals	with	the	various	stages	of	creative	ideation	(information”),	while	the
quadrangular	series	deals	with	the	insubstantiation	of	forms.

These	terms	may	sound	formidable,	but	they	are	simple	enough.	The	trine	is
an	 aspect	 of	 “vision”	 and	 “perspective.”	 It	 refers	 to	 the	 birth	 of	 ideas	 or
viewpoints,	 to	 the	 initial	 phase	 of	 a	 new	 plan	 and	 a	 new	 purpose.	 The
conjunction	is	emphasis.	As	this	emphasis	begins	to	operate	it	takes	form	as	an
idea,	 a	 project,	 a	 new	 interest	 for	 the	 personality	 to	 flow	 into	 creatively.	 At	 a
further	 stage,	 the	 sextile	 brings	 forth	 the	 project	 or	 idea	 to	 a	 point	 where	 it	 is
seen	actually	at	work	within	the	warp	and	woof	of	personality.	Still	further,	the
semi-sextile	 shows	 the	 idea	 decomposed	 into	 its	 polar	 elements	 and	 correlated
with	the	routine	of	everyday	activity.

If	we	now	consider	the	quadrangular	series,	we	see	in	the	square	the	power
that	 forces	 the	 abstract	 idea	 to	 become	 a	 concrete	 body.	 It	 is	 the	 power	 of
incarnation,	 of	 birthing.	 It	 is	 indeed	 crucifixion,	 from	 the	 spirit’s	 viewpoint.
From	the	point	of	view	of	substance,	it	means	getting	the	stones	out	of	the	quarry
and	 building	 them	 into	 the	 perpendicular	 walls	 of	 the	 future	 building.	 The
general	keynote	is	mobilization.	The	semi-square	symbolizes	the	first	realization
of	 the	 self	 after	 its	 being	 encased	 in	 substance.	 It	 can	 be	 a	 very	 depressing
realization;	but	it	can	also	be	the	first	realization	of	power,	for	power	necessitates
some	kind	of	insubstantiation.	The	semi-square	is	thus	an	aspect	of	power	for	the
soul	who	understands	the	laws	of	life	and	of	power.	But	it	is	an	aspect	of	despair
and	 great	 loneliness	 for	 the	 soul	 which	 regrets	 its	 spiritual	 “freedom.”	 If	 the
square	signifies	“mobilization,”	the	semi-square	has	the	meaning	of	“action”	in
the	 military	 sense	 of	 this	 term.	 The	 individual	 is	 in	 the	 service	 of	 collective
purposes.

There	 is,	 however,	 another	 series	 which	 is	 also	 important:	 the	 series	 of
quintile,	 semi-quintile	 and	 semi-semi-quintile	 (18	 degrees).	 This	 series	 deals
with	 the	 operation	 of	 the	 individual	 factor	 per	 se;	 and	 as	 such	 is	 very	 little
understood.	It	is	based	on	a	fivefold	differentiation,	and	integrates,	as	it	were,	the
two	 preceding	 series.	 When	 two	 planets	 are	 in	 quintile	 aspect,	 the	 relation

between	 these	 two	 planets	 is	 seen	 to	 release	 a	 particular	 value	 of	 individual
significance.	 From	 quintiles	 the	 genius	of	 an	 individual	 can	 be	 to	 some	 extent
determined.	In	between	the	square	(90°)	and	the	sextile	(6o°),	the	quintile	(72°)
shows	the	creative	freedom	of	the	individual	in	molding	materials	into	forms	that
are	 true	 to	 the	 idea	 they	 are	 meant	 to	 express.	 There	 is	 found	 the	 “individual
touch”	 of	 the	 genius	 which	 transforms	 a	 routine	 action	 into	 an	 inspiring,
significance-releasing	performance.	The	semi-quintile	refers	more	particularly	to
the	technique	 of	 the	 performance.	 Its	 half	 (18°)	 suggests	 the	 point	 where	 mere
accentuation	 (conjunction)	 orients	 itself	 toward	 significant	 performance:	 the
imponderable	factors	of	talent.

The	septile	is	significant	only	in	a	planetary	sense.	It	is,	we	may	remember,
the	division	of	the	“Great	Polar	Cycle.”	Through	the	septile	we	may	see,	in	rare
instances,	 an	 overshadowing	 of	 planetary	 purpose—truly,	 as	 Marc	 Jones	 says,
fatality	at	work.	As	for	the	nonagen,	its	importance	may	be	revealed	in	an	age	in
which	 the	 number	 9	 is	 coming	 to	 increased	 significance—as	 evidenced	 by	 the
fact	 that	 it	 is	 the	 sacred	 number	 of	 Bahaism,	 and	 the	 number	 on	 which	 Bahai
temples	are	to	be	founded.	We	spoke	before	of	the	meaning	of	the	number	40.
The	relationship	between	two	planets	forty	degrees	apart	may	indicate	spiritual
birth	or	initiation	in	the	realm	to	which	the	planets	refer.	It	signifies	“birth	out	of
captivity.”

All	these	aspects	have	been	taken,	as	it	were,	from	the	point	of	conjunction.
But	 some	 of	 them	 can	 be	 taken	 also	 from	 the	 opposition.	 That	 is	 to	 say,	 a
sesquiquadrate	aspect	(135°)	is	an	opposition	(180°)	less	a	semi-square	(45°).	A
quincunx	 (150°)	 is	 an	 opposition	 less	 a	 semi-sextile	 (30°),	 etc.	 In	 those
secondary	 aspects	 we	 see	 the	 operation	 of	 “counter-accent.”	 They	 indicate,	 in
subtle	 analysis,	 the	 reaction	 to	 personal	 activity:	 the	 residua	 of	 activity.	 They
may	 also	 refer	 to	 the	 “turning	 back”	 of	 activity	 upon	 its	 source:	 inner
sublimation,	spiritual	transmutation.	The	so-called	bi-quintile	(144°)	can	also	be
considered	as	an	opposition	less	a	semi-quintile	(36°).	Here	may	be	seen	at	work
the	 technique	 of	 creative	 introversion.	 But,	 negatively	 speaking,	 this	 may	 also
suggest	certain	types	of	obsessions,	a	“complex”	creating	its	hallucinations.

Again	 let	 us	 repeat	 that	 no	 aspect	 is	 fortunate	 or	 unfortunate.	 Each	 may	 be
seen	as	a	positive	or	a	negative	phase	of	the	personality.*	What	is	more	important
still,	no	single	aspect	is	of	any	real	significance	unless	it	be	seen	as	an	integral
part	 of	 the	 total	 planetary	 pattern.	 We	 have	 to	 analyze,	 first,	 each	 aspect
separately,	in	order	to	get	our	basic	elements	for	synthetic	realization.	But	this	is

merely	the	preliminary	phase	of	the	acquisition	of	a	technique	of	interpretation.
The	 true	 interpreter	 reads	 the	 planetary	 pattern	 as	 a	 reader	 reads	 a	 word	 or	 a
sentence.	Only	the	beginner	keeps	spelling	the	letters	one	by	one.

## B.	THE	PLANETARY	PATTERN	AS	A	WHOLE

Here	we	deal	not	only	with	the	elementary	relationship	between	two	planets
but	with	relationships	that	involve	the	whole	personality,	that	focus	the	meaning
of	 the	 whole	 personality.	 When	 a	 person	 is	 met	 for	 the	 first	 time,	 the	 intuitive
individual	gets	at	once	a	general,	synthetic	“feeling”	from	such	a	meeting.	The
wholeness	of	him	reacts	to	the	wholeness	of	the	other	person.	This	is	what	we
previously	called	“holistic	perception.”	If	such	a	perception	is	very	keen,	it	will
often	single	out	one	or	 two	 basic	characteristics	 which,	as	 it	 were,	 focalize	 the
“feeling”	 aroused	 by	 the	 person.	 Some	 of	 the	 features	 of	 this	 person’s	 total
personality	 will	 stand	out	as	centers	 of	significance.	 Significance	 will	 organize
itself	around	these	centers.	Through	the	latter	the	person	will	be	classified	into
one	of	a	few	general	types,	and	such	a	classification	will	center	and	clarify	the
general	“feeling.”

The	determination	of	centers	of	significance,	of	what	Marc	Jones	calls	“focal
determinators,”	 is	 the	 first	 and	 most	 important	 factor	 in	 the	 interpretation	 of	 a
birth-chart,	 if	 such	 an	 interpretation	 is	 to	 reveal	 truly	 the	 wholeness,	 the
livingness,	 of	 the	 personality—and	 not	 be	 merely	 pieced-together	 fragmentary
information	about	the	behavior	of	the	person.	It	is	not	only	the	most	important
but	 the	 most	 difficult	 factor.	 Each	 individual	 interpreter	 must	 more	 or	 less
develop	 his	 own	 technique	 of	 “focal	 determination”—according	 to	 the	 genius
which	his	own	chart	may	reveal.	Besides,	only	he	who	is	(relatively)	whole	can
have	 correct	 holistic	 perceptions;	 and	 in	 order	 to	 determine	 centers	 of
significance	one	must	needs	be	also	a	center	of	significance.

There	are,	however,	a	few	general	principles	of	“focal	determination”	which
can	 be	 stated,	 for	 they	 are	 after	 all	 only	 extensions	 of	 well-known	 astrological
factors	upon	which	the	very	symbolism	of	zodiac,	houses	and	aspects	is	founded.
To	understand	these	is	to	understand	“form,”	or	“Gestalt”—in	terms	of	modern
psychology;	 it	 is	 to	 grasp	 the	 genius	 of	 “groupings”	 and	 of	 “patterns	 of
behavior.”	Just	as,	according	to	new	methods	of	learning	how	to	read,	the	child
is	 no	 longer	 taught	 to	 spell	 letter	 after	 letter,	 but	 instead	 to	 recognize	 at	 once
groups	of	letters	and	word-formations,	so	also	the	astrologer	who	seeks	to	learn
how	 to	 fathom	 the	 livingness	 of	 the	 personality	 which	 the	 chart	 symbolizes
should	 train	 himself	 in	 the	 instantaneous	 recognition	 of	 basic	 planetary	 and

zodiacal	 formations.	 Tabulation	 of	 factors	 is	 helpful	 in	 checking	 results	 and
getting	to	a	finer	degree	of	analysis.	But	holistic	perception	draws	the	whole	and
its	parts	to	a	center	of	significance	and	of	livingness.	It	reveals	the	“soul”	of	the
situation,	 the	 power	 that	 animates	 the	 whole—the	 wholeness	 of	 the	 whole,	 the
spirit-energy	within	the	form.

The	 first	 and	 simplest	 determination	 of	 the	 total	 meaning	 of	 the	 planetary
pattern	 is	 made	 when	 the	 planets	 are	 distributed	 in	 specific	 ways	 through	 the
four	quarters	of	the	chart;	that	is,	in	relation	to	the	“axes	of	selfhood”—horizon
and	 meridian.	 For	 the	 sake	 of	 simplicity	 and	 brevity,	 we	 shall	 enunciate,	 one
after	the	other,	the	general	(very	general!)	meaning	to	be	attributed	to	the	basic
configurations	which	one	may	encounter.

All	 planets	 above	 the	 horizon:	 “The	 native	 necessarily	 lives	 out	 in	 life”	 or
“finds	 the	 focus	 of	 his	 own	 inner	 consciousness	 wholly	 in	 external	 events.”
(Marc	 Jones.)	 A	 tendency	 to	 extraversion	 and	 to	 adopt	 an	 objective—often
materialistic—viewpoint.	(Cf.	Queen	Victoria’s	and	Mussolini’s	charts.)

All	 planets	 below	 the	 horizon:	 “The	 native	 lives	 within	 himself	 or	 in	 more
subjective	 realms”	 or	 “finds	 the	 focus	 of	 his	 own	 inner	 consciousness	 within
internal	reactions.”	(Marc	Jones.)	A	tendency	to	introversion.	An	intuitive	type.

All	 planets	 East	 or	 West	 of	 the	 meridian:	 “The	 zenith	 meridian	 divides	 the
universe	 (all	 experience)	 into	 realms	 of	 rising	 things	 (East)	 and	 setting	 things
(West).	...	If	all	planets	are	East	the	native	is	called	upon	to	make	his	own	choice
in	every	issue,	and	to	create	the	issue	at	will;	whereas	if	West	he	must	accept	the
choices	and	issues	of	life	as	these	are	placed	before	him.”	(Marc	Jones.)	This	is	a
division	 of	 “outer	 volition.”	 Usually	 an	 exclusively	 Eastern	 preponderance
indicates	 an	 accent	 on	 thinking—for	 thought	 is	 the	 element	 of	 (relative)	 free-
will;	while	an	exclusively	Western	preponderance	indicates	a	feeling-emphasis,
for	 feelings	 are	 almost	 purely	 determined	 by	 the	 external	 conditioning	 of	 the
relation	between	subject	and	subject,	or	between	subject	and	object.

Moreover,	all	planets	may	be	found	in	one	of	the	four	quarters.	This	is	rare,
but	 produces	 a	 still	 more	 absolute	 emphasis	 on	 one	 of	 the	 four	 functions	 of
individual	selfhood:	intuition	(North-east	quarter),	feeling	(North-west	quarter),
sensation	or	relationship	(South-west	quarter),	thinking	(South-east	quarter).

In	considering	such	matters	two	important	ideas	must	be	held	in	mind.	The
first	 one	 is	 that	 no	 definite	 conclusions	 can	 be	 drawn	 from	 the	 fact	 that	 no
planets	 are	 found	 in	 a	 house.	 The	 absence	 of	 accentuation	 does	 not	 mean	 a

negative	 emphasis.	 Wholeness	 is	 always	 to	 be	 understood	 as	 the	 basis	 of	 any
organic	 being;	 therefore	 it	 is	 always	 implied	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 any	 particular
emphasis.	 This	 absence	 of	 emphasis	 may	 mean	 the	 previous	 fulfillment	 of	 the
quality	 represented	 by	 the	 non-emphasized	 house	 or	 sign;	 or	 it	 may	 mean	 a
virgin	state	of	non-differentiation.	It	always	refers	to	an	unconscious	state,	rather
than	to	a	conscious	one.	But	health	is	unconscious,	until	it	is	experienced	by	the
sick	 person	 as	 the	 absence	 of	 illness.	 Likewise	 unconsciousness	 may	 be	 most
potent	as	a	background	of	psychological	health.	Again	let	us	repeat	that	God,	or
Universal	Being,	may	be	said	to	be	beyond	any	planetary	accentuations,	because
every	“degree”	of	the	wholeness	of	universal	being	is	accentuated	equally.	Man
only	has	“planets”	because	he	is	a	particular	being.	God	has	none—figuratively
speaking,	of	course.

The	 second	 point	 refers	 to	 what	 Marc	 Jones	 calls	 “balance	 in	 weight,”	 a
matter	which	fits	in	perfectly	with	the	principles	of	Gestalt	 psychology.	 If	 nine
planets	are	found	in	one	hemisphere	and	the	tenth	in	the	other	hemisphere,	this
tenth	stands	out	powerfully,	from	a	form	point	of	view.	A	pattern	is	constituted	in
which	 one	 planet,	 because	 of	 its	 position,	 is	 seen	 balancing	 the	 nine	 others.	 It
becomes	 an	 absolutely	 “outstanding”	 factor;	 and,	 to	 a	 considerable	 extent,
destroys	 the	 implication	 of	 all	 the	 other	 planetary	 factors	 in	 the	 other
hemisphere.	Marc	Jones	compares	this	formally	isolated	planet	(“singleton”)	to
an	 aching	 tooth	 which	 dominates	 the	 whole	 consciousness.	 It	 is	 a	 type	 of
accentuation	which	is	“irrational,”	which	tends	to	destroy	the	sense	of	wholeness
of	the	personality.	It	is	an	autocratic	factor	dictating	its	singular	will	to	the	rest	of
the	organism,	which	by	contrast	appears	inchoate.

As	an	interesting	illustration,	we	have	Mussolini’s	chart	which	shows	a	dual
type	of	form-emphasis.	All	his	planets	are	above	the	horizon.	Moreover,	Uranus
stands	 alone	 in	 the	 eastern	 hemisphere	 —more	 precisely,	 in	 the	 South-east
quarter.	The	mass-emphasis	is	in	the	section	of	the	chart	which	deals	with	human

relationship	 and	 denotes	 self-realization	 through	 human	 contacts	 and	 objective
being.	 He	 is	 seen	 to	 accept	 the	 choices	 and	 issues	 of	 life	 as	 these	 are	 placed
before	 him:	 a	 man	 ruled	 by	 his	 objective	 destiny.	 But,	 while	 this	 is	 true	 in	 a
fundamental	 sense,	 Uranus,	 accentuated	 as	 a	 “singleton	 by	 house	 position,”
indicates	 that	 there	 is	 a	 powerful	 and	 insistent	 release	 of	 unconscious	 factors
operating	 as	 subjective	 volition	 (Eastern	 hemisphere),	 and	 moreover,	 that	 the
operation	is	through	a	mechanism	of	sudden	thinking	(South-east	quarter).	The
latter	 fact	 is	 corroborated	 by:	 1)	 a	 planetary	 concentration	 in	 zodiacal	 signs	 of
concrete	thinking	(Gemini	and	Virgo)	or	of	vivid	image-making	power	(Venus-
Jupiter	 conjunction	 in	 Cancer,	 in	 the	 house	 of	 “vision”);	 2)	 the	 fact	 that	 the
Moon’s	 North	 Node	 is	 in	 the	 twelfth	 house,	 implying	 power	 released	 through
meditation	or	subjective	introspection.

This	last	fact,	and	the	power	of	unconscious	racial	factors	in	Mussolini’s	life,
are	further	emphasized	by	the	massing	of	all	the	planets	inside	of	an	exact	trine
of	Neptune	and	Uranus	(planets	of	the	unconscious).	The	total	configuration	is
balanced,	as	it	were,	each	side	of	the	Jupiter-Venus	conjunction	which	is	sextile
to	both	Uranus	and	Neptune.	This,	however,	belongs	to	another	type	of	emphasis
to	which	we	shall	come	presently.	At	present,	we	have	yet	to	stress	the	point	of
the	 placing	 of	 all	 the	 planets	 in	 the	 southern	 hemisphere.	 This	 is	 a	 basic
accentuation	 of	 collective	 or	 objective	 factors—so	 that	 however	 much	 Uranus
might	suggest	the	operation	of	an	interior	self-conditioned	will	or	power,	yet	this
will	is	seen	operating	solely	in	terms	of	collective	factors.	Even	while	his	“part
of	imaging”	(his	release	of	genius)	is	located	below	the	horizon,	yet	it	is	in	the
second	 house	 referring	 to	 racial	 inheritance	 and	 atavistic	 possessions—a
collective	factor,	though	within	the	individual	realm.

### Another	type	of	emphasis	is	produced	by	the	placing	of	all	planets	in	the	four

basic	divisions	of	the	zodiac.

All	planets	between	Aries	and	Libra	(in	the	order	of	the	signs):	This	indicates
that	 the	 “principal	 responsibility	 of	 the	 life	 is	 spiritual”	 (Marc	 Jones)—or,	 we
would	rather	say,	it	refers	to	the	projection	of	ideas	and	archetypes	into	objective
manifestation.	 Mussolini	 is	 an	 amazingly	 strong	 example	 of	 this	 type	 of
emphasis	—whether	one	likes,	or	does	not,	the	type	of	ideas	which	he	projects.

All	 planets	 between	 Libra	 and	 Aries:	 This	 indicates	 that	 “the	 principal
responsibility	 of	 the	 life	 is	 material”	 (Marc	 Jones)—or	 rather,	 it	 refers	 to	 the
development	of	faculties	which	are	the	outcome	of	previous	spiritual	activity	and
the	matrix	of	future	manifestations.

All	planets	in	signs	of	long	ascension	(from	Cancer	up	to	Capricorn):	“The
inner	life	is	lived	to	make	itself	manifest	to	the	outer	life.”	(Marc	Jones.)	This	is
the	 period	 when	 the	 Sun	 moves	 southward.	 What	 has	 been	 gained	 during	 the
other	 half	 of	 the	 year	 is	 brought	 out	 into	 objectivity.	 The	 soul	 comes	 into
manifestation.

All	planets	in	signs	of	short	ascension	(from	Capricorn	up	to	Cancer):	“The
inner	life	is	lived	to	make	outer	life	manifest	to	itself.”	(Marc	Jones.)	This	is	the
period	when	the	Sun	moves	northward:	traditionally,	a	period	of	spiritual	growth
and	inner	realizations.	The	fruits	of	objective	experience	are	garnered	and	there
is	an	inward	maturing	process,	the	growth	of	significance.

Here	 also	 one	 could	 apply	 the	 principle	 of	 singleton	 emphasis,	 a	 planet	 in
one	section	of	the	zodiac	balancing	all	others	in	the	opposite	section.	We	should
add,	moreover,	that	by	changing	the	words	“all	planets”	into	“most	planets”	one
could	still	get	at	a	less	strong,	yet	noticeable,	preponderance	of	values.

Whether	the	circle	of	houses	or	that	of	zodiacal	signs	is	considered,	what	is
done	actually	is	a	quartering	of	the	whole	cycle	by	establishing	two	axes	at	right
angles	to	each	other.	Such	an	operation	is	related	to	the	determination	of	square
aspects.	 It	 deals	 with	 the	 establishment	 of	 a	 structure	 of	 manifestation,	 the
prototype	 of	 which	 is,	 of	 course,	 the	 “four	 seasons	 of	 the	 year.”	 One	 could
attempt	 the	 same	 thing	 with	 any	 one	 of	 the	 axes	 provided	 by	 astrological
symbolism—especially	 with	 the	 nodal	 axes	 of	 the	 planets.	 We	 saw	 previously
that	 the	 Moon’s	 nodal	 axis	 could	 be	 considered	 as	 establishing	 a	 “line	 of
Destiny”	 between	 the	 past	 and	 the	 future	 (the	 karma	 and	 dharma)	 of	 an
individual.	 Thus	 the	 hemisphere	 counted	 from	 the	 North	 Node	 (counter-
clockwise)	refers	to	the	power	of	developing	new	spiritual	faculties,	whereas	the
hemisphere	 counted	 from	 the	 South	 Node	 refers	 to	 the	 working	 out	 of	 past
tendencies.

In	 Mussolini’s	 chart,	 all	 planets	 are	 in	 the	 hemisphere	 counted	 from	 the
South	Node,	which	gives	a	striking	testimony—which	might	astonish	many.	The
Italian	 dictator	 is	 shown	 as	 doing	 in	 this	 life	 what	 he	 presumably	 had	 done	 in
several	 preceding	 lives	 —or,	 to	 state	 it	 differently,	 as	 being	 the	 last	 of	 a	 long
ancestral	line	of	similar	figures.	In	this	sense,	he	may	be	said	to	be	a	replica	of
the	 Caesar-image:	 a	 restatement	 of	 an	 old	 racial	 formula,	 which	 thus	 adds
nothing	 spiritually	 new,	 but	 is	 a	 culmination	 of	 racial	 karma—of	 individual
karma	also,	according	to	the	theory	of	reincarnation.

### This	same	procedure	could	be	followed	by	considering	the	nodal	axes	of	the

planets;	 but	 the	 results	 require	 too	 subtle	 an	 interpretation	 to	 be	 of	 practical
importance.	 Mussolini’s	 chart	 again	 offers
interesting	 possibilities	 of
interpretation	 along	 the	 line	 of	 planetary	 nodes’	 analysis,	 as	 at	 least	 five	 of	 his
planets	 are	 situated	 on	 the	 North	 Nodes	 of	 other	 planets.	 This	 would	 tend	 to
show	that	his	personality	is	a	pattern	drawn	according	to	an	inner	super-personal
plan.	We	might	call	him	a	“racial	avatar,”	with	tremendous	psychic	race-forces
back	of	him.	This	is	suggested	by	the	symbol	of	the	Sun-degree.

Another	type	of	zodiacal	emphasis	is	provided	by	the	unequal	distribution	of
planets:	1)	in	fire,	air,	water,	earth	signs;	2)	in	cardinal,	fixed	or	mutable	signs.
This	 is	 a	 type	 of	 emphasis	 very	 often	 found	 in	 modern	 astrological	 practice.	 It
seems	to	have	little	significance,	however,	unless	the	inequality	of	distribution	is
very	 great.	 A	 most	 definite	 preponderance	 of	 planets	 in	 one	 type	 of	 zodiacal
signs	is	needed,	if	significant	conclusions	are	to	be	arrived	at.	We	must	refer	to
our	analysis	of	the	meaning	of	zodiacal	categories.	A	planetary	emphasis	in	any
category	will	bring	out	the	meaning	and	power	of	that	category	in	the	life	of	the
native.

So	 far	 we	 have	 studied	 planetary	 formations	 which	 were	 determined	 by
reference:	1)	to	the	circle	of	houses;	2)	to	the	circle	of	zodiacal	signs.	The	first
refers	 basically	 to	 the	 individual’s	 character	 and	 destiny;	 the	 second,	 to	 the
collective	factors	of	his	being.	By	considering	the	“patterns	of	aspects”	made	by
the	planets,	we	have	another	type	of	form-determination	which	refers	mostly	to
the	 personality	 itself.	 What	 we	 are	 dealing	 with	 now	 is	 an	 extension	 of	 the
principle	 of	 “aspect.”	 The	 following	 are	 aspects	 involving	 several	 planets;	 in
other	words,	planetary	groupings.	Their	names	and	a	brief	description	follows:

Stellium.	 This	 is	 a	 multiple	 conjunction;	 a	 complex	 accentuation	 which
involves	 more	 than	 two	 planets	 located	 in	 a	 small	 area.	 There	 is	 a	 stellium	 by
house,	 when	 a	 mass	 of	 planets	 (at	 least	 four	 or	 five)	 are	 found	 inside	 of	 one
house;	a	stellium	by	sign,	when	the	same	number	are	located	in	one	sign,	or	in
half	 of	 a	 sign.	 Here,	 as	 in	 the	 simple	 conjunction,	 much	 depends	 on	 what	 the
planets	 are,	 and	 how	 distant	 they	 are	 from	 each	 other.	 The	 result	 is	 often
confusion	 and	 personal	 involvement	 in	 the	 qualities	 represented	 by	 house	 or
sign.	 The	 planetary	 accents	 blur	 each	 other.	 What	 stands	 out	 is	 the	 quality
represented	by	house	or	sign,	rather	than	the	activity	symbolized	by	the	several
planets.

Fan-handle.	 This	 magnified	 type	 of	 opposition	 occurs	 when	 a	 singleton
opposes	a	stellium;	that	is,	when	one	planet,	alone	in	a	hemisphere,	opposes	all

other	 planets	 in	 the	 opposite	 hemisphere.	 According	 to	 Marc	 Jones,	 “the
singleton	 contributes	 to	 the	 stellium	 and	 throws	 the	 emphasis	 back	 into	 the
hemisphere	 containing	 the	 other	 planets.	 The	 stellium	 emphasis	 becomes	 a
psychological	or	inner	burden	of	manifestation.	It	indicates	a	soul	with	a	more-
than-physical	problem.”	The	meaning	of	the	emphasized	sign	(rather	than	house)
becomes	 the	 outstanding	 factor.	 The	 twentieth	 century	 opened	 with	 a	 most
characteristic	 stellium,	 opposing	 Neptune	 to	 all	 other	 (then	 known)	 planets.	 To
add	to	the	meaning	of	this	configuration,	it	was	balanced	exactly	on	the	Moon’s
nodes	 axis.	 Placing	 Pluto	 on	 the	 map	 detracts	 from	 the	 one-pointedness	of	 the
configuration,	 as	 this	 planet	 was	 close	 to	 Neptune.	 Yet,	 as	 Neptune	 and	 Pluto
both	refer	to	universalistic	factors,	and	as	the	configuration	is	so	striking,	it	can
still	profitably	be	considered	as	a	fan—with	a	forked	handle!

Grand	 Trine.	 In	 this	 and	 the	 following	 multiple	 aspects	 we	 are	 confronted
with	 the	 perfect	 manifestation	 of	 single	 aspects.	 We	 saw	 that	 a	 trine	 was
produced	by	inscribing	an	equilateral	triangle	in	the	circumference;	a	square,	by
inscribing	 a	 square,	 etc.	 We	 are	 now	 considering	 configurations	 in	 which	 a
planet	(or	several	planets)	are	found	located	at	each	of	the	angles	of	the	inscribed
polygon.

A	Grand	Trine	is	thus	a	figure	in	which	three	planets	are	mutually	related	by
120°	 angles.	 Some	 astrologers	 have	 considered	 such	 a	 configuration	 very
favorable,	 others	 unfavorable.	 That	 it	 should	 be	 deemed	 unfavorable	 when	 the
trine	is	always	taken	as	the	most	harmonious	aspect	does	not	seem	very	logical.
Yet	 there	 is	 some	 truth	 in	 the	 assertion,	 when	 we	 are	 confronted	 with	 an	 exact
triangular	 formation;	 for	 when	 some	 of	 the	 most	 important	 activities	 of	 the
personality	are	symbolically	so	related,	they	are	so	well	equilibrated	or	“formed”
that	 there	 is	 very	 little	 incentive	 for	 outward	 manifestation	 and	 creation.	 The
Grand	Trine	is	thus,	especially	when	a	very	exact	formation,	a	symbol	of,	at	least
relative	 spiritual	 inertia.	 If,	 however,	 one	 of	 the	 planets	 (or	 groups	 of	 planets)
entering	into	this	configuration	forms	a	square	aspect	to	another	planet,	then	this
square	acts	as	a	“channel	of	release”	for	the	energies	locked	in	the	Grand	Trine.

Usually	 the	 Grand	 Trine	 produces	 an	 emphasis	 on	 one	 of	 the	 four	 zodiacal
qualities	 (fire,	 air,	 water,	 earth)	 as	 it	 links	 normally	 the	 three	 signs	 referring	 to
the	same	quality.	Yet	this	need	not	be	so,	if	the	planets	are	located	near	the	cusps.
Therefore	 the	 Grand	 Trine	 cannot	 be	 said	 to	 have	 any	 particular	 significance
because	of	that.	If	it	does	link,	let	us	say,	three	fire	signs,	then	the	implication	is
that	the	“fire”	quality	(“motion	toward	objective	manifestation”	or	“emanation”)
is	thoroughly	formed	within	the	native’s	being.

Great	 (or	 Cosmic)	 Cross.	 This	 configuration	 is	 established	 by	 four	 planets
(or	 groups	 of	 planets)	 in	 mutual	 90°	 relationship.	 It	 is	 to	 be	 considered	 as
establishing	the	“perfect	cube,”	or	“perfect	stone”	of	Masonic	lore.	It	symbolizes
the	total	em-bodiment	of	the	idea,	or	purpose,	or	self,	in	other	words,	fulfillment
in	 objective	 and	 concrete	 existence.	 In	 a	 negative	 sense,	 what	 is	 meant	 is
crystallization	and	spiritual	bondage	in	matter.

The	most	usual	way	in	which	a	multiple	square	is	found	is,	however,	as	a	T
configuration.	 The	 square	 figure	 is	 not	 complete.	 Instead	 of	 the	 four-armed
cross,	we	have	an	Egyptian	Tau,	or	by	implication,	an	ansated	cross—which,	of
course,	 is	 the	 hieroglyph	 of	 a	 man	 with	 arms	 horizontally	 stretched	 out.	 In	 a
birth-chart	with	such	a	configuration	there	is	an	empty	house	(or	sign)	where	the
man’s	head	would	be.	What	is	indicated	is	the	utmost	release	of	spirit	or	purpose
toward	 material	 existence.	 This	 is	 a	 highly	 dynamic	 configuration.	 The	 three
arms	of	the	cross	throw	a	dynamic	emphasis	into	the	empty	house,	which	often
is,	as	it	were,	occupied	by	a	whirlpool.	In	the	phase	of	individual	selfhood	and
destiny	represented	by	the	empty	house	the	native	finds	himself	usually	helpless,
torn	by	raging	conflicts.	Only	the	very	strong	and	conscious	ego	is	able	to	master
such	 a	 dissonant	 release	 of	 power.	 If	 he	 does,	 then	 an	 amazing	 amount	 of
creative	energy	is	his.

The	perfection	of	more	complex	polygonal	formations,	like	the	quintile	and
the	 sextile,	 is	 a	 rare	 phenomenon.	 But	 sometimes	 three	 planets	 are	 in	 mutual
quintile	 aspect—or	 rather	 three	 of	 them	 constitute	 two	 quintiles,	 and	 the	 outer
two	are	related	by	tri-quintile	aspect	(216°)—a	very	creative	linkage	between	the
three	types	of	activities	symbolized	by	the	planets,	with	the	suggestion	that	what
is	being	created	is	a	spiritual	faculty,	which	very	likely	may	not	be	evident	in	the
outer	life.

A	 complete	 hexagonal	 formation	 (Grand	 Sextile)	 is	 even	 rarer;	 but	 often
three	planets	are	in	correlated	sextile—the	outermost	constituting	a	trine	equally
divided	by	the	middle	one.	This	is	what	is	seen	so	strikingly	in	Mussolini’s	chart,
with	 the	 added	 emphasis	 due	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 all	 planets	 are	 located	 within	 the
trine	 of	 Uranus	 and	 Neptune	 (bisected	 by	 the	 conjunction	 Venus-Jupiter).	 This
particular	configuration	tends	to	show	that	the	entire	personality	is	a	“formation
of	 the	 race’s	 unconscious,”	 governed	 by	 the	 conscious.	 The	 Jupiter-Venus
conjunction	at	the	center	of	the	configuration	indicates	the	point	of	emergence	of
the	 formative	 power	 of	 the	 collective	 unconscious	 in	 terms	 of	 consciousness.
Being	 in	 the	 ninth	 house,	 this	 power	 is	 not	 only	 formative	 but	 expansive.	 The

conjunction	Jupiter-Venus	shows	it	to	be	of	an	idealistic	order.	Being	in	Cancer,
the	ideal	will	project	itself	with	clearly	imaged	outlines.	Jupiter	is	situated	in	a
degree	 (Cancer	 19°)	 which	 symbolizes	 “the	 inner	 adjustment	 of	 values	 by	 the
unconscious	processes	of	nature,	taking	the	best	of	the	old	for	the	inspiration	of
the	new.”	(Marc	Jones)

A	complete	hexagonal	configuration	occurred	on	July	15,	1935,	with	Uranus
in	 Taurus;	 Mercury,	 Sun	 and	 Pluto	 in	 Cancer;	 Venus	 and	 Neptune	 in	 Virgo;
Jupiter	 in	 Scorpio;	 Moon	 in	 Capricorn;	 and	 Saturn	 in	 Pisces—linking	 all
“feminine”	 signs	 of	 the	 zodiac.	 This	 was	 a	 configuration	 highly	 productive	 for
work	and	especially	for	detailed	planning	in	terms	of	practical	sustained	activity.
Children	born	at	such	a	time	should	prove	to	be	skillful	organizers	—especially
as	the	square	of	Sun	and	Mars	was	at	the	same	time	releasing	the	power	which
otherwise	 might	 have	 remained	 in	 a	 static	 condition	 of	 self-enjoyment	 and
esthetical	self-indulgence.

A	 configuration	 of	 the	 same	 type	 is	 that	 in	 which	 four	 planets	 constitute
alternately	 sextiles	 and	 trines.	 A	 rectangle	 is	 formed	 whose	 geometrical
proportions	suggest	a	mystical	significance.	In	the	chart	of	the	wife	of	one	of	the
greatest	living	painters	Uranus	in	Virgo	8°,	Moon	in	Scorpio	6°,	Jupiter	in	Pisces
4°,	 Neptune	 in	 Taurus	 12°	 constitute	 such	 a	 configuration.	 Uranus	 is	 sextile	 to
the	 Moon	 and	 trine	 Neptune,	 which	 is	 sextile	 to	 Jupiter	 in	 trine	 to	 the	 Moon.
This	 is	 an	 interesting	 combination	 of	 trines,	 sextiles—and	 of	 course,	 two
oppositions.	 A	 good	 symbol	 of	 “practical	 mysticism.”	 This	 person	 has	 been	 a
remarkable	 force	 of	 sustainment	 to	 her	 husband,	 in	 inner	 as	 well	 as	 in	 outer
ways,	 combining	 spiritual	 awareness,	 outer	 productivity	 and	 purposeful
planning.

In	 all	 such	 definite	 planetary	 patterning	 we	 may	 always	 suspect	 equally
definite	 problems	 in	 the	 sphere	 of	 personality.	 Either	 these	 problems	 are	 the
manifestation	 of	 psychological	 complexes	 which	 tend	 to	 make	 the	 personality
“different”	and	often	socially	unadapted,	or	else	the	personality	carries	a	burden
of	 super	 personal	 (planetary)	 responsibility	 demanding	 a	 strict	 focalization	 and
particularization	of	viewpoint.	Mussolini’s	chart	is	the	most	typical	of	the	latter
case	which	has	come	to	our	attention.	It	is	an	over-focalized	chart.	The	man	is
alive	solely	to	serve	a	racial	purpose	and	will	die	in	that	purpose.

On	 the	 other	 hand,	 a	 chart	 without	 any	 outstanding	 focalization	 may	 mean
either	a	scattered	personality	or	a	being	whose	destiny	it	is	to	link,	to	harmonize,
and	to	be	a	symbol	of	wholeness	of	being.	This	of	course	is	the	mark	of	a	true

individual—one	approximating	the	likeness	of	the	perfect	Individual	that	is	God,
the	 equally	 all-accentuated	 Being.	 A	 Mussolini	 is	 not	 an	 individual,	 but	 is	 a
racial	purpose	made	personality.	He	is	a	most	particularized	or	specialized	being:
the	man	of	a	collective	work.	This	is	made	clear	by	every	possible	factor	in	his
chart,	even	to	the	position	of	the	South	Node	(karma	point)	in	the	sixth	house	(of
service,	work	and	discipleship	to	ideal	or	personality)	and	on	a	degree	“of	real
capitalization	 upon	 tradition	 and	 established	 value.”	 (The	 woman	 of	 Samaria
comes	to	draw	from	Jacob’s	well.)

### ______________

*	One	might	ask	what	a	polygon	which	could	not	be	inscribed	in	a	circle	would	signify	as	a	particular
form.	It	would	be	a	form	which	is	not	“organic;”	that	is,	in	which	the	principle	of	wholeness	(circularness)
could	 not	 operate	 and	 integrate	 the	 separate	 parts.	 This	 occurs	 symbolically	 in	 cases	 of	 schizophrenia,	 of
multiple	personalities,	of	insanity—and	of	suicide.	The	hand	of	the	man	who	shoots	himself	is	guided	by
one	 of	 the	 soul-energies	 which,	 because	 of	 internal	 disharmony	 or	 external	 compulsion,	 has	 bulged,	 as	 it
were,	outside	of	the	circle	of	wholeness	of	the	psyche.	In	this	sense,	every	suicide	is	partially	insane.	“He”
does	not	kill	himself;	but	one	of	his	“soul-forces”	that	has	burst	outside	of	the	sacred	circle	of	the	self	pulls
the	trigger.	Another	word	describing	the	process	is,	of	course,	“obsession.”

*	The	reader	may	notice	that	the	first	aspect	after	the	conjunction,	considering	angular	distance,	is	the
semi-sextile—or	30°.	Even	if	we	allow	ten	or	more	degrees	“orb”	for	a	conjunction,	there	are	still	several
angular	 values	 unaccounted	 for.	 In	 subtle	 analysis	 the	 half	 of	 semi-quintile	 (18°),	 and	 even	 semi-sextile
(15°),	can	be	taken	into	consideration.	But	the	main	idea	is	that	no	aspect	of	practical	significance	occurs
until	two	 planets	are	 separated	 by	 a	 whole	 zodiacal	sign	 (30°).	 Actually,	 if	 the	 planets	 are	located	 in	two
different	signs,	there	may	be	“aspects”	of	less	than	thirty	degrees.	But	they	are	ordinarily	unnoticed.

*	 In	 horary	 astrology,	 or	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 casting	 charts	 from	 lunations,	 ingresses,	 etc.,	 for	 general
prognostications,	“personality”	becomes	“the	particular	situation	and	problem	considered.”	These,	not	being
actual	 organisms,	 do	 not	 react	 to	 or	 compensate	 for	 special	 stresses	 or	 accents.	 In	 such	 cases,	 the
quadrangular	series	of	aspects	means	a	breaking	down	of	factors,	while	the	triangular	series	is	an	integrating
of	values.	Thus	one	is	considered	good,	the	other	evil.	But	where	there	is	true	organic	being,	these	ethical
terms	become	subservient	to	the	purposes	of	the	whole	organism.

## THE	BIRTH-CHART	AND	THE	PROGRESSIONS

Selfhood	and	Destiny
It	is	said	that	on	the	portal	of	the	temple	of	Delphi	in	ancient	Greece	one	could
see	 inscribed	 these	 words:	 KNOW	 THYSELF.	 These	 words	 were	 truly	 indeed	 the
keynote	of	an	age	and	a	civilization	which,	for	the	first	time	in	human	history,
sought	 to	 raise	 the	 focus	 of	 man’s	 consciousness	 to	 the	 intellectual	 level.	 The
great	life-problem	for	Greek	civilization—and	for	most	of	the	European	culture
which	 unfolded	 from	 the	 seed	 sowed	 by	 the	 Greeks—was	 the	 problem	 of
knowledge:	 the	 nature,	 limitations	 and	 extension	 of	 knowledge.	 This	 led	 to	 a
study	of	the	process	of	development	of	the	conscious	and	rational	sphere	of	the
ego;	then,	by	complementary	reaction,	with	Christianity,	to	the	development	of	a
system	 of	 devotional	 ethics—which	 in	 turn	 modified	 itself	 into	 a	 system	 of
rational	ethics.

We	claim	that	a	new	basic	life-problem	is	confronting	the	“New	World”	of
the	 West—by	 which	 we	 mean,	 not	 only	 the	 races	 living	 on	 the	 American
continent,	 but	 all	 men	 who	 are	 willing	 to	 emerge	 from	 the	 typical	 patterns	 of
classical	 Europeanism	 and	 into	 a	 new	 realm	 of	 being.	 We	 believe	 that	 the
American	 continent	 is	 the	 symbol	 of	 this	 new	 realm	 of	 being,	 but	 not	 the
exclusive	 habitat	 of	 men	 that	 are	 born	 therein.	 The	 new	 life-problem	 for	 such
men—	individually—and	for	the	American	continent—in	a	planetary	sense—is
the	problem	of	fulfillment	And	thus	we	present	the	future	builders	of	the	temple
of	American	“mysteries”	with	a	key-utterance,	not	new	in	itself,	of	course,	but
new	as	a	focal	point	for	the	collective	consciousness:	FULFILL	THYSELF.

Knowledge	and	Fulfillment:	two	words	of	tremendous	importance	when	used
as	 focal	 terms	 for	 whole	 civilizations!	 In	 a	 sense,	 at	 least,	 they	 can	 be	 seen	 to
correspond	respectively	to	two	other	mighty	words:	Space	and	Time.	Knowledge
is	 spatial	 in	 its	 essence	 because	 it	 is	 derived	 from	 the	 establishment	 of
relationships	 of	 extension	 and	 contrast.	 Intellectual	 knowledge	 is	 based	 on

analysis	 and	 objectivity,	 on	 the	 isolation	 of	 factors	 and	 elements	 studied	 apart
from	the	whole	to	which	they	belonged,	and	from	which	they	had	been	removed
for	analytical,	experimental	or	even	esthetical	purposes.

On	 the	 other	 hand,	 fulfillment	 is	 durational	 and	 cyclic—holistic	 —in	 its
essence.	 It	 is	 a	 process	 which	 unfolds	 at	 the	 very	 core	 of	 duration,	 and	 is
conditioned	 by	 the	 general	 laws	 of	 cyclic	 becoming.	 It	 is	 not	 analytical	 or
ethical;	 not	 even	 rational	 or	 predominantly	 conscious.	 It	 cannot	 be	 charted	 by
exact	 formula.	 It	 cannot	 be	 defined	 accurately	 so	 as	 to	 fit	 all	 particular	 or
individual	 cases,	 even	 though	 it	 follows	 a	 well-definable	 rhythm	 with
computable	 climaxes	 and	 critical	 phases.	 Moreover,	 this	 process	 of	 fulfillment
does	not	deal	with	the	parts	of	an	organism	or	with	the	elements	of	a	situation,	as
detachable	factors.	It	must	always	be	referred	to	wholes.	The	fulfillment	of	parts
is	bound	to	the	fulfillment	of	the	whole	of	which	they	are	parts.	There	can	be	no
isolated	fulfillment	of	a	part.	It	can	be	only	a	relative	or	illusory	consummation.

Yet	as	each	part	is	a	whole,	just	as	each	whole	can	be	considered	a	part	of
some	 vaster	 whole,	 there	 are	 relative	 moments	 of	 fulfillment:	 “life-transitions”
during	 which	 wholeness	 operates	 within	 any	 fulfilled	 whole.	 After	 this	 occurs,
this	whole	realizes	itself	as	part	of	a	greater	whole—and	duration	and	its	cycles
of	fulfillment	go	on,	ever	and	ever	more.	But	every	fulfillment,	though	we	may
analyze	 it	 spatially	 and	 intellectually	 as	 purely	 relative—in	 terms	 of	 some
greater	whole—is,	after	all,	an	absolute.	It	is	absolute	inasmuch	as	wholeness	is
operating	 absolutely	 through	 every	 fulfilled	 whole,	 small	 or	 large.	 In	 fact,
smallness	 or	 greatness	 are	 spatial,	 “knowledge”	 valuations.	 In	 terms	 of
fulfillment,	 every	 fulfilled	 whole	 is	 actually	 and	 absolutely	 God.	 This	 is	 the
realization	 often	 symbolized	 by	 the	 term	 “eternal	 now.”	 We	 may	 call	 it	 a
“mystical”	 realization.	 What	 it	 is	 called	 matters	 little.	 Experienced	 fulfillment
has	no	need	of	intellectual	definition.	It	is	a	subjective	totalistic	experience;	and
this	experience	is	“one-with”	the	moment	within	which	it	occurs.	Such	a	moment
is	 what	 we	 previously	 called	 a	 “seed-moment”—what	 the	 modern	 Theosophist
expresses	(and	materializes)	in	a	planetary	sense	as	a	“Seed-Manu.”

We	have	already	stated	such	ideas	in	the	chapters:	“Astrology	Faces	Modern
Thought”	and	“Individual,	Collective,	Creative,”	etc.	But	it	was	necessary	to	re-
formulate	them	in	a	somewhat	altered	fashion,	for	this	fundamental	dualism	of
knowledge	 and	 fulfillment,	 space	 and	 time,	 is	 the	 key	 to	 the	 most	 important
distinction	 which	 we	 encounter	 as	 we	 come	 to	 consider	 the	 practical
applicability	 and	 utility	 of	 astrology.	 On	 one	 hand,	 we	 have	 what	 is	 called	 the
radical	birth-chart	which	gives	us	the	symbolical	pattern,	or	hieroglyph,	of	the

individual	being—a	spatial	figure.	On	the	other	hand,	 we	have	what	are	 called
progressions	 or	 directions,	 which	 aim	 at	 determining	 the	 unfoldment	 of	 the
individual	being	throughout	the	span	of	his	Earthly	life—a	time	element.

The	confused	state	in	which	astrological	theory,	as	well	as	practice,	is	found
today	 is	 due	 largely	 to	 the	 common	 lack	 of	 understanding	 of	 the	 relationship
existing	 between	 these	 two	 realms	 of	 astrological	 determination:	 spatial	 and
durational.	 Moreover,	 system	 after	 system	 of	 progressions	 or	 directions	 are
propounded	 —each	 apparently	 most	 satisfactory
in	 many	 cases,	 most
unsatisfactory	in	just	as	many	others.	Hardly	ever	is	an	attempt	made	to	give	a
philosophical,	coherent	interpretation	of	what	“progressions”	really	mean	and	of
why	 they	 operate	 at	 all—when	 they	 do.	 This	 and	 the	 next	 chapter	 will	 be
devoted	 to	 the	 suggestion	 of	 such	 an	 interpretation,	 in	 the	 hope,	 at	 least,	 of
elucidating	several	basic	points	and	of	offering	solutions	for	confusing	problems.
The	 birth-chart	 of	 an	 individual,	 indicating	 the	 pattern	 made	 by	 celestial
bodies	surrounding	the	Earth,	in	reference	to	horizon	and	meridian	and	in	terms
of	 zodiacal	 longitudes,	 is	 called	 also	 the	 radical	 chart,	 being	considered	as	the
root-factor	 in	 all	 astrological	 interpretation.	 The	 term	 “root”	 is	 somewhat
inaccurate,	and	“seed”	would	be	a	much	better	word;	for	it	is	in	the	seed	and	not
in	 the	 root	 that	 the	 “archetypal	 form”	 of	 the	 plant-to-be	 is	 focused.	 But	 the
distinction	is	a	purely	philosophical	one,	with	no	practical	bearing	on	the	matters
which	we	are	now	considering.

A	 birth-chart	 is	 the	 symbolical	 macrocosmic	 representation	 of	 the	 potential
fullness	of	the	perfected	microcosm.	It	is	the	“blueprint”	of	the	complete	man.	It
is	 therefore	 nothing	 but	 a	 set	 of	 potentialities;	 and	 it	 defines	 by	 implication
everything	that	could	possibly	be	found	in	 the	perfected	man.	Because	 it	refers
only	to	potentialities,	it	is	entirely	abstract.	Because	it	is	a	representation	formed
by	 macrocosmic	 factors	 (planets,	 horizon,	 etc.),	 it	 is	 purely	 symbolical.	 It
indicates	nothing	factual;	nothing	concrete;	nothing	precisely	“fated.”	It	outlines
what	would	be	if	the	personality	matured	into	the	full	likeness	of	the	archetype,
if	actuality	accurately	matched	potentiality.	There	is	not	one	single	precise	event
of	 a	 man’s	 life	 to	 be	 found	 as	 such	 in	 his	 birth-chart.	 What	 can	 be	 traced	 are
more	 or	 less	 definite	 types	 of	 potential	 eventualities,	 with	 varying	 degrees	 of
“actualizability”	at	certain	more	or	less	accurately	determinable	times	of	his	life.
In	other	words,	the	birth-chart	is	a	set	of	spatial	factors	which	determine	the
archetypal	 structure,	 or	 form,	 of	 the	 whole	 man—if	 he	 ever	 becomes	 whole.
Nothing	can	indicate	absolutely	whether	the	man	will	become	whole,	or	remain

—like	 most	 people—a	 vague	 sketch,	 with	 ill-defined	 outlines	 largely	 absorbed
by	the	collective	racial	background.	However,	from	the	whole	chart	there	arises
often	an	imponderable	significance	which	gives	to	the	astrologer	with	developed
holistic	 perception	 (or	 with	 inherited	 “psychic”	 gifts)	 a	 clue	 as	 to	 the	 ultimate
status	of	the	native	at	the	end	of	his	life;	in	other	words,	how	much	of	his	life
will	be	a	success,	 how	much	a	failure.	But	 failure	and	success	mean	only	this:
Whether	 or	 not	 the	 actual	 life-performance	 has	 been	 true	 to	 the	 “score”	 of	 the
individual	 selfhood	 and	 destiny;	 whether	 or	 not,	 speaking	 in	 terms	 of	 Hindu
philosophy,	the	man	has	fulfilled	his	dharma.

Selfhood	 and	 Destiny.	 These	 two	 terms	 can	 be	 referred	 respectively	 to	 the
radical	chart,	and	to	the	progressions	derived	therefrom;	also	to	space	and	time,
knowledge	 and	 fulfillment.	 The	 self	 is	 to	 be	 known:	 Destiny	 is	 to	 be	 fulfilled.
Both	 are	 abstractly	 identical	 in	 form.	 Yet	 the	 life	 of	 a	 man	 may	 be	 a	 mere
caricature	of	his	Destiny,	or	a	mere	sketch	with	blurred	outlines.	Destiny,	as	we
understand	the	term,	carries	no	meaning	of	absolute	and	factual	determinism.	It
is	a	schedule	of	unfoldment	for	the	purpose	of	manifesting	concretely	the	blue-
print	 which	 selfhood	 represents.	 We	 have	 already	 emphasized	 this	 point,	 but	 it
needs	repeated	emphasis.	Selfhood	is	a	set	of	potentialities;	at	the	most,	a	small
architect’s	model	of	the	finished	building.	But	while	the	architect	draws	the	blue-
print	and	sets	the	schedule	of	operation	and	of	delivery	of	building	materials,	he
cannot	tell	whether	an	earthquake,	a	strike,	a	war	or	any	such	collective	factor,
transcending	 both	 architect	 and	 plans,	 will	 disturb	 the	 schedule.	 Yet	 if	 the
building	 is	 completed,	 it	 will	 have	 to	 be	 an	 actual	 embodiment	 of	 the	 plans—
unless	a	spiritual	tragedy	occurs,	such	as	the	death	of	the	architect.

Selfhood	is	a	space-factor.	Abstractly,	this	refers	to	the	interior	space	of	pure
being,	a	factor	of	pure	relationship	containing	as	many	“dimensions	of	space”	as
there	 are	 related	 elements.	 Concretely,	 this	 refers	 to	 the	 outer	 structure	 of	 the
body—that	 is	 to	 say,	 essentially,	 to	 the	 skeleton	 (the	 Saturn	 factor)	 and	 to	 the
individual	 appearance,	 the	 Ascendant.	 Being	 a	 space-factor,	 selfhood	 is
susceptible	 of	 being	 known,	 through	 form-analysis	 and	 significance-releasing
synthesis.	 It	 is	 the	 seed-factor	 of	 manifested	 being.	 The	 monad—the	 unit	 of
energy,	or	life—is	the	root-power.	Destiny	is	the	schedule	of	growth	of	the	plant.
It	is	the	process	whereby	selfhood	is	made	manifest.	It	is	therefore	conditioned
primarily	 by	 the	 form	 of	 the	 self	 (seed-form:	 viz.,	 the	 birth-chart);	 but	 also
secondarily	by	the	nature	of	the	social	and	cosmic	environment	in	the	midst	of
which	growth	takes	place.

In	 other	 words,	 while	 Destiny	 is	 essentially	 the	 individual	 schedule	 of

growth,	 it	 is	 also	 subject	 to	 modifications	 which	 are	 not	 determined	 by	 the
individual	(his	form	or	his	past),	but	which	are	the	results	of	the	Destiny	of	the
greater	whole	(race,	planet,	cosmos)	of	which	the	individual	is	a	part.	The	basic
internal	 relationship	 of	 this	 greater	 whole	 to	 the	 individual	 is	 indicated	 by
various	factors	in	the	individual’s	birth-chart;	but	the	transitory	external	pressure
of	 the	 collectivity	 upon	 the	 individual	 is	 another	 factor	 belonging	 to	 the
becoming	(not	to	the	being)	of	the	greater	whole.	This	is	seen	in	what	astrology
calls	“transits.”

Destiny	is	selfhood	in	the	becoming.	Fulfillment	is	knowledge	demonstrated
and	 made	 operative	 through	 the	 whole	 of	 the	 knower’s	 physiological	 and
psychological	 organism.	 Thus	 fulfillment	 is	 dependent	 upon	 knowledge.	 The
completeness	 of	 fulfillment	 is	 a	 function	 of	 the	 depth	 and	 extension	 of
knowledge.	 Thus	 knowledge	 symbolically	 represents	 the	 East,	 fulfillment,	 the
West.	 All	 knowledge	 comes	 from	 the	 East,	 but	 fulfillment	 occurs	 in	 the	 West.
This	is	so,	not	only	symbolically	and	astrologically	speaking,	but	concretely	as
well.	 In	 every	 unit	 of	 civilization	 knowledge	 arises	 in	 the	 East,	 fulfillment	 is
reached	in	the	West.	India	was	the	source	of	the	knowledge	that	was	fulfilled	in
the	East-Mediterranean	world.	Greek	knowledge	in	turn	was	fulfilled	in	French
integration.	 European	 knowledge	 is	 being	 fulfilled	 in	 America.	 Atlantic
knowledge	reaches	Pacific	fulfillment.	All	that	is	needed	to	complete	the	picture
is	to	add	that	spiritual	and	regenerative	power	comes	from	the	North	and	takes
form	as	religion	in	the	South,	as	is	shown	in	the	fact	that	all	effete	civilizations
so	 far	 have	 been	 overcome	 and	 regenerated	 by	 the	 invasions	 of	 “barbarians”
(regenerative	men	who	are	pure	power	without	formed	consciousness)	from	the
North—in	 India,	 in	 Europe,	 in	 Mexico.	 Moreover,	 most	 established	 religions
find	 their	 permanent	 center	 in	 the	 South	 and	 propagate	 northward:	 witness
Buddhism	spreading	from	India	to	China	and	Japan;	Catholicism	established	in
Rome;	Islam	moving	from	Arabia	to	Persia,	Northern	India	and	Spain,	etc.

The	foregoing	may	thus	explain	the	reason	why	we	consider	the	birth-chart
as	 the	 symbol	 of	 the	 knowledge	 and	 power	 (selfhood)	 of	 the	 individual,	 while
progressions	 refer	 to	 the	 fulfillment,	 the	 re-ligion	 (etymologically,	 that	 which
“binds	 back”)	 of	 his	 life.	 To	 interpret	 the	 birth-chart	 is	 relatively	 (most
relatively!)	simple	because	we	are	there	dealing	with	a	self-contained	structure.
Certain	 factors	 in	 the	 chart	 truly	 refer	 to	 the	 outside	 world	 and	 the	 collective
inheritance	 and	 environment;	 but	 the	 reference	 is	 always	 to	 be	 considered	 in
terms	of	the	individual	person.	What	is	shown	is	not	the	state	of	the	collective
environment	 (as	 in	 transits	 and	 birthday	 charts)	 pressing	 upon	 the	 individual

person,	 but	 the	 knowledge	 and	 power	 of	 adaptation	 of	 this	 individual	 to	 the
collective	within	his	total	being.

In	 other	 words,	 everything	 found	 in	 the	 natal	 or	 radical	 chart	 refers	 to	 the
native’s	total	being;	that	is,	to	the	sum	total	of	potentialities	this	being	contains.
And	we	may	here	add	that	these	potentialities,	while	they	are	definite	as	to	their
structure,	are	practically	infinite	as	to	the	depth	of	their	connections.	That	is	to
say,	 the	 form	 of	 my	 being—my	 individual	 selfhood—is	 basic;	 and	 change	 or
development	here	means	only	an	increasingly	closer	approximation	of	the	outer
“body”	(or	bodies)	to	the	archetypal	seed-form,	which	is	changeless	throughout
an	 entire	 planetary	 cycle.	 But	 the	 contents	 of	 my	 being—the	 sum	 of	 the
connections	I	have	established	with	the	universe,	the	total	of	my	assimilations	—
are	 relatively	 unlimited.	 The	 limits	 are	 drawn	 only	 by	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 human
person,	 being	 a	 part	 of	 the	 greater	 whole	 that	 we	 called	 the	 “planetary
Individual,”	 is	 conditioned	 by	 the	 harmonious	 development	 of	 this	 “planetary
Individual.”	This	refers	to	what	the	occultist	calls	the	“Ring-Pass-Not.”

Scientifically	 speaking,	 we	 would	 say	 that,	 the	 number	 of	 brain	 and	 nerve-
cells	 not	 being	 infinite,	 the	 sum	 total	 of	 their	 possible	 connections	 and
correlations	 is	 therefore	 not	 infinite.	 But	 the	 ordinary	 man	 of	 today	 operates
relatively	so	few	of	these	possible	connections	that	the	possibilities	of	expansion
of	the	contents	of	his	being	are	practically	unlimited—even	though	the	form	of
his	 individual	 selfhood	 remains	 a	 constant	 factor.	 Likewise,	 the	 skeleton	 is	 an
almost	 constant	 factor	 in	 the	 human	 race,	 approximating	 ever	 more	 closely	 by
very	 slow	 and	 cyclic	 progress	 (which	 includes	 regressive	 periods)	 what	 we
would	call	the	Archetypal	Form	of	Man.	Yet	man	may	change	the	contents	of	his
body	by	eating	one	kind	of	food	or	another	(within	the	limits	of	what	the	Earth
produces),	by	overeating	or	by	starving	himself,	etc.

On	 the	 other	 hand,	 in	 “progressions”	 we	 are	 dealing	 with	 a	 very	 complex
proposition,	 because	 we	 are	 dealing	 with	 the	 process	 of	 life	 itself.	 And	 this
means	 perpetual	 change	 and	 thus,	 theoretically	 at	 least,	 imprevisibility.	 The
process	of	life	is	the	constant	flux	of	the	birth,	fulfillment	and	breaking	away	of
relationship.	 And	 it	 can	 never	 be	 absolutely	 and	 accurately	 charted.	 It	 contains
necessarily,	 unavoidably,	 a	 coefficient	 of	 indeterminacy,	 which	 in	 numerical
symbolism	is	the	fractional	value	by	which	π	(3.14159	.	.	.)	is	greater	than	3,	and
in	astrological	Earth-symbolism	the	value	of	the	fraction	365	(or	366%)	divided
by	360.

### Selfhood	and	Relationship	are	the	two	polarities	of	being,	corresponding	in

astrological	 symbolism	 to	 the	 Eastern	 and	 Western	 horizons.	 The	 former
constitutes	the	form	of	being;	the	latter	refers	to	the	contents	of	the	manifested
“body”—at	all	levels—of	the	being.	Selfhood	per	se	is	changeless	(throughout	a
cycle	of	the	greater	Whole	in	which	it	occurs).	Relationship	is	in	a	constant	state
of	 flux;	 and	 is	 fundamentally	 imprevisible	 from	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the	 self
which	 is	 one	 of	 the	 multiple	 factors	 constituting	 this	 multitudinous	 stream	 of
relations.	 The	 Eastern	 world	 has	 emphasized	 the	 element	 of	 selfhood;	 the
Western	world	that	of	relationship—two	opposite	viewpoints	which	can	never	be
rationally	reconciled,	though	they	can	be	integrated	in	the	creative	behavior	of
personality.

This	 fact	 constitutes	 the	 general	 principle	 of	 indeterminacy	 which	 extends
Heisenberg’s	 special	 principle	 of	 indeterminacy	 stating	 that	 one	 can	 never
accurately	determine	at	the	same	time	the	location	and	the	speed	of	a	sub-atomic
particle.	 Location	 here	 symbolizes	 selfhood,	 and	 speed	 symbolizes	 process:
space	and	time,	once	more.	In	astrology,	we	have	likewise	to	concentrate	either
on	selfhood-determination	or	on	prognostications.	Each	factor	requires	a	special
type	of	emphasis,	and	a	special	type	of	astrologer.

Birth-chart	and	relatively	unchartable	progressions.	To	some	extent	at	least
we	 must	 choose	 our	 polarization	 and	 allegiance.	 The	 highly	 individualized
person	will	be	usually	more	at	ease	with	the	determination	of	selfhood	through
natal	symbolism;	while	the	person	largely	influenced	by,	and	an	 expression	of,
collective	 and	 racial	 factors	 will	 be	 more	 naturally	 attracted	 toward	 and	 more
successful	 in	 prognostication,	 “horary	 astrology”	 and	 fortune-telling.	 The	 two
points	of	view	can,	of	course,	be	integrated	in	a	highly	gifted	personality,	but	an
emphasis	of	either	one	or	the	other	will	be	always	noticeable.	The	situation,	in
this	 respect,	 is	 similar	 to	 that	 referring	 to	 psychological	 introversion	 and
extraversion.	 There	 is	 always	 an	 accentuation	 one	 way	 or	 the	 other;	 but	 the
determination	 of	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 accentuation	 is	 at	 times	 made	 very	 difficult
because	 “in	 every	 pronounced	 type	 there	 exists	 a	 special	 tendency	 towards
compensation	for	the	one-sidedness	of	his	type,	a	tendency	which	is	biologically
expedient	since	it	is	a	constant	effort	to	maintain	psychic	equilibrium.”*

The	same	is	true	in	relation	to	the	accuracy	of	a	person’s	actual	response	to
indications	 contained	 either	 in	 the	 natal	 chart	 or	 in	 the	 calculation	 of
progressions	 and	 transits.	 Some	 lives	 will	 be	 most	 accurately	 charted	 by
implications	 found	 in	 the	 birth-chart	 and	 in	 those	 “directions”	 which	 merely
spread	 out	 in	 time	 the	 structure	 of	 the	 birth-chart.	 Others	 will	 seem	 accurately

governed	 by	 transits,	 “secondary	 progressions,”	 birthday	 charts,	 and	 will	 not
seem	to	“fit	in”	very	closely	with	a	birth-chart	interpretation.

The	 natural	 conclusion	 would	 be	 that	 introverts	 and	 highly	 individualized
persons	 live	 true	 to	 their	 birth-chart	 and	 not	 so	 exactly	 to	 their	 progressions;
while	the	opposite	applies	to	extraverts	and	collectively	influenced	persons.	But
it	is	not	always	so.	For	a	strongly	introverted	person,	by	virtue	of	his	or	her	lack
of	 ease	 of	 functioning	 in	 society,	 may	 be	 at	 the	 mercy	 of	 society—	 helplessly
conditioned	 outwardly	 by	 demands	 made	 by	 others,	 the	 more	 he	 or	 she
withdraws	inwardly	and	tries	to	be	strictly	an	“individual.”	On	the	other	hand,	a
typical	 extravert	 may	 be	 unconsciously	 pulled	 toward	 “spiritual”	 subjects	 to
compensate	 for	 his	 extraversion,	 and	 he	 or	 she	 may	 be	 utterly	 helpless	 and
compelled	by	whatever	occurs	in	his	inner	self,	and	in	his	or	her	attempts	to	be
“individual”	 and	 “different.”	 Thus	 transits	 are	 often	 cruel	 to	 introverts,	 and
“primary”	 or	 “radix	 directions”	 shattering	 to	 extra-verts.	 The	 problem	 is	 as
complex	as	life	itself.	Not	to	see	why	it	should	be	so,	and	to	depreciate	astrology
because	 it	 is	 so,	 are	 symptoms	 of	 poor	 judgment	 and	 of	 a	 total	 lack	 of
understanding	of	the	nature	and	function	of	astrology.

in	 which	 astrological

factors	of	radical	positions,	of	progressions,	directions,	transits,	into	some	sort	of

maze	of	usually	unrelated	concepts,	we	shall	be	able	to	summon	before	his	mind
a	vision	of	the	total	operation	of	a	birth-chart	and	of	its	consequences,	in	space
and	time—a	vision	which	undoubtedly	is	not	easily	held	in	mind,	yet	which,	if
referred	to	consistently	and	constantly,	will	bring	order	and	significance	where,
presumably,	there	was	before	but	chaos	or	vagueness.

### Steps	in	the	Interpretation	of	a	Birth-chart

A	birth-chart	can	(and	should)	be	regarded	as	a	complex	geometrical	formula
establishing	 relations	 between	 a	 number	 of	 points	 determined	 by	 astronomical
observations.	Fundamentally,	there	are	ten	“planets”	(including	Sun	and	Moon),
twelve	 cusps	 and	 the	 Moon’s	 nodes—viz.,	 twenty-four	 factors.	 A	 birth-chart	 is
thus	 a	 formula	 relating	 these	 twenty-four	 primary	 factors	 in	 terms	 of	 their
zodiacal	 longitude	 (to	 which	 declination—distance	 North	 or	 South	 of	 the
Celestial	 Equator—is	 also	 sometimes	 added	 to	 determine	 what	 are	 called

“parallels	 of	 declination”).	 To	 interpret	 a	 birth-chart	 is	 to	 extract	 out	 of	 these
twenty-four	factors	all	the	significance	which	they	contain,	or	rather,	which	the
astrologer	is	able	to	perceive.	This	extraction	of	significance	is	done	by	means	of
a	 series	 of	 analyses,	 each	 analysis	 being	 theoretically	 complete	 in	 itself	 as	 it
covers	 a	 whole	 field	 of	 being,	 yet	 all	 these	 analyses	 constituting	 only	 the	 raw
materials	 out	 of	 which	 the	 final	 synthesis	 is	 built.	 As	 already	 said,	 astrology
depends	 mostly,	 insofar	 as	 a	 life-interpretation	 is	 concerned,	 upon	 synthetic
“holistic	perception.”	But	the	latter	is	a	purely	individual	factor;	and	in	writing
about	 chart-interpretation	 one	 must	 needs	 emphasize	 the	 analytical	 processes,
which	are	necessary:	1)	as	a	training	for	the	development	of	basic	knowledge;	2)
as	 a	 means	 of	 checking	 up	 on	 the	 results	 of	 “holistic	 perception;”	 that	 is,	 of	 a
direct	 perception	 of	 the	 total	 interrelationships	 linking	 the	 twenty-four	 primary
elements	of	the	birth-chart	and	any	other	secondary	factors	that	may	be	derived
therefrom.

These	several	analyses	to	which	the	birth-chart	is	subjected	can	be	made	in
varying	order,	such	an	order	being	a	purely	individual	matter.	We	shall	indicate
what	they	are,	giving	them	in	a	sequence	which	is	derived	from	the	logic	of	the
situation,	as	we	have	studied	it	in	this	book.	But	let	us	always	keep	in	mind	that
our	 first	 task	 is	 to	 study	 the	 twenty-four	 primary	 factors	 above-mentioned
(planets,	cusps,	Moon	nodes).	These	factors	are	significant	in	terms	of:

1)	Their	sign	position.
2)	Their	house	position	(this	does	not	apply	to	cusps).
3)	Their	degree	position	(symbols	of	the	degree;	also	relation	to	planetary

nodes).

This	first	stage	of	interpretation	is	an	analysis	of	position	in	which	each	factor	is
considered	 independently	 of	 any	 other,	 and	 is	 followed	 by	 an	 analysis	 of
relationships	between	these	factors,	thus:

4)	The	planetary	pattern	as	a	whole.
5)	The	aspects	between	every	two	isolated	factors.

Then	 comes	 another	 type	 of	 analysis,	 which	 may	 or	 may	 not	 be	 made	 use	 of.
Two	 factors	 are	 being	 related	 to	 a	 third	 factor,	 which	 is	 ordinarily	 (but	 not
necessarily)	either	the	line	of	horizon	or	the	meridian.	This	is	a	higher	degree	of
analysis	of	relationship,	and	it	reveals	significance	of	a	complex	sort—such	as	is

related	to	man’s	social	nature	and	to	the	processes	whereby	his	own	society	of
cells	and	nerves	become	ever	more	closely	integrated	toward	the	formation	of	a
“spiritual	body.”	This	refers	to	the	Parts.

In	 this	 last	 type	 of	 analysis	 we	 no	 longer	 deal	 solely	 with	 the	 human
personality	as	it	is	archetypally	or	in	“blueprint.”	We	deal	with	the	use	to	which
this	 personality	 or	 any	 group	 of	 factors	 within	 the	 total	 personality	 can	 be	 put.
We	 are	 now	 considering	 not	 only	 “being”	 and	 its	 structure,	 but	 also	 “purpose”
and	its	axes	of	crystallization.

One	step	further,	and	we	shall	be	studying	not	only	axes	of	crystallization	(or
sensitive	nexi	of	relationship),	but	we	shall	visualize	the	very	crystallization	of
potential	 relationship	 into	 actual	 personality-occurrences.	 How	 shall	 we	 do	 so?
By	considering	these	same	angular	relationships	between	the	twenty-four	factors
—and	more	simply	the	arcs	(distances)	separating	them,	but	considering	them	in
terms	of	potential	phases	of	maturation.	In	other	words,	we	shall	simply	convert
spatial	 values	 into	 time	 values.	 But	 we	 shall	 do	 so	 without	 having	 recourse	 to
anything	outside	of	our	twenty-four	factors;	simply	by	a	refinement	of	analysis
such	 as	 to	 bring	 in	 a	 fourth-dimensional	 value	 of	 mathematical	 time,	 where
before	we	had	only	three-dimensional	spatial	relationship.

To	 put	 it	 simply,	 we	 shall	 interpret	 our	 birth-chart	 in	 such	 a	 way	 that,	 by
transposing	our	point	of	view	of	analysis,	we	shall	obtain	time-values	(phases	of
the	life-process)	where	before	we	had	considered	space-values.

In	 order	 to	 accomplish	 this	 result	 we	 have	 to	 cease	 considering	 the	 360
degrees	of	the	zodiac	as	indices	to	structural	relationship	of	being,	and	to	begin
to	regard	them	as	symbols	of	phases	of	life-unfoldment	We	have	to	transpose	our
analysis	 from	 the	 plane	 of	 geometrical	 measurements	 to	 that	 of	 clock-
measurements.	By	doing	this	we	are	evidently	entering	the	realm	of	progressions
and	more	particularly	of	“directions.”	But	there	is	a	great	difference	between	the
ordinary	 progressions	 or	 directions	 and	 the	 procedure	 just	 stated—even	 if	 the
difference	appears	on	the	surface	to	be	more	theoretical	than	practical.

We	shall	be	able	to	evaluate	this	difference	more	accurately	as	we	presently
study	the	foundation	on	which	the	complex	weaving	of	progressions,	directions
and	 transits	 is	 built.	 But	 we	 must	 take	 one	 step	 at	 a	 time,	 lest	 we	 become
hopelessly	 entangled	 in	 concepts	 which	 have	 grown	 in	 the	 field	 of	 modern
astrological	thought	more	like	wild	flowers	than	like	cultivated	productions.	Our
next	step	will	consist	in	studying	briefly	what	might	be	called	the	“time-analysis
of	the	birth-chart.”

### Time-analysis	of	the	Birth-chart

The	 procedure	 is	 a	 simple	 one.	 Consider	 Mussolini’s	 chart.	 The	 Moon	 is
placed	 on	 Gemini	 8°	 50’;	 Jupiter,	 on	 Cancer	 18°	 33’.	 The	 distance	 (or	 “arc”)
between	them	is	therefore	39°	43’.	Let	us	translate	a	one-degree	arc	into	a	year
of	 the	 life-process.	 In	 this	 case	 the	 relationship	 Moon-Jupiter,	 instead	 of	 being
expressed	by	a	39°	43’	arc	(a	spatial	value),	will	be	stated	as	a	39-year	and	less
than	9-months’	relationship.	What	is	meant	thereby	is	that	the	rapport	between
Moon	 (referring	 to	 the	 relation	 to	 the	 public,	 to	 the	 past	 ancestry,	 the	 feelings,
etc.)	 and	 Jupiter	 (referring	 to	 the	 point	 of	 emergence	 of	 the	 Self,	 to	 authority,
power,	etc.),	which	exists,	potentially	and	archetypally	in	the	birth-chart,	will	be
actualized	 at	 a	 time	 of	 the	 life	 which	 we	 postulated	 as	 39	 years	 and	 9	 months
after	 birth.	 The	 Fascists’	 march	 on	 Rome,	 which	 gave	 Mussolini	 dictatorial
power,	occurred	when	Mussolini	was	39	years	and	3	months	old.	Other	aspects
made	it	occur	somewhat	ahead	of	the	time	above	calculated.

The	 birth-relationship	 Mars	 to	 Sun	 can	 be	 expressed	 likewise	 by	 saying
either	 that	 it	 is	 a	 52°	 51’	 relation	 of	 arc,	 or	 a	 52	 years	 and	 about	 10	 months’
relation	of	period.	In	terms	of	aspect	the	relationship	is	balanced	between	an	8
degree-plus	 semi-square	 and	 a	 7	 degree-minus	 sextile.	 Does	 it	 mean	 “fate	 is
hanging	 in	 the	 balance”	 for	 Mussolini	 in	 June	 1936?	 Other	 indications	 might
corroborate	 the	 possibility	 of	 that	 month	 being	 one	 of	 expansion	 (Sun	 in	 ninth
house)	and	traveling	involving	aggressiveness	and	danger.	But	as	Mars	and	Sun
are	the	two	so-called	“rulers”	of	the	chart	(a	point	the	meaning	of	which	we	shall
discuss	briefly	later),	there	is	a	chance	that	the	relationship	may	actualize	itself
as	 extreme	 increase	 of	 power;	 though	 it	 is	 undoubtedly	 a	 dangerous	 chance,
considering	 the	 fact	 that	 an	 eclipse	 fell	 on	 his	 Sun	 July	 29,	 1935;	 a	 “transit”
indication.	At	any	rate,	it	will	mark	a	turning	point	in	Mussolini’s	destiny.*

The	 arc	 between	 Saturn	 and	 Jupiter	 equals	 41°.	 The	 age	 41	 was	 a	 very
critical	 time	 for	 Mussolini,	 as	 the	 result	 of	 the	 Matteotti	 murder	 in	 which
prominent	Fascists	were	implicated.	Yet	he	rode	through	the	storm	roused	by	the
opposition;	perhaps	because	Saturn	was,	at	his	birth,	sextile	Sun.	So	what	might
have	been	his	doom	fortified,	instead,	his	position.

Mussolini’s	 planets	 being	 placed	 in	 relatively	 close	 grouping,	 the	 result	 is
that	nearly	all	of	them	can	be	mutually	related	by	this	“time-analysis”	method.
This	 indicates	 that	 the	 whole	 of	 the	 nature	 will	 be	 drawn	 out	 into	 actual	 and
positive	 operation.	 Instead	 of	 calculating	 the	 arcs	 separating	 the	 planets,	 one
could	calculate	arcs	separating	a	planet	from	an	aspect	of	opposition	to	another

planet.	The	period	so	revealed	would	show	a	linking	of	the	two	planets,	not	in
terms	 of	 activity	 (conjunction	 aspect)	 as	 previously,	 but	 in	 terms	 of	 awareness
(opposition	aspect).	In	Mussolini’s	chart	this	could	probably	occur	only	between
Neptune	and	Uranus,	at	the	age	of	60.	This	would	mark—if	he	reaches	that	age
—a	moment	of	great	realization	of	the	fundamental	and	spiritual	significance	of
his	 mission	 and	 Destiny—not	 in	 terms	 of	 something	 to	 be	 done,	 but	 of	 the
meaning	of	something	that	has	been	done.

Linking	 through	 squares,	 trines,	 sextiles,	 may	 also	 be	 attempted.	 For
instance,	Mussolini’s	Sun	and	Mercury	are	separated	from	a	square	to	Moon	(in
Virgo	 8°	 50’)	 by	 32°	 51’	 and	 33°	 20’.	 This	 brings	 out	 time-values	 of	 about	 33
years	and	33	years	and	one-half.	He	was	seriously	wounded	in	the	war	at	the	age
of	33	years	and	6	months.

These	examples	will	have	sufficed	to	give	an	idea	of	the	procedure	followed.
It	 remains,	 however,	 for	 us	 to	 explain	 why	 the	 operation	 of	 translating	 space-
values	into	time-values	was	based	upon	the	equivalence	of	degrees	of	zodiacal
arcs	 to	 years	 of	 the	 life.	 This	 much-discussed	 question	 will	 be	 dealt	 with	 from
another	angle	when	we	study	the	theory	of	progressions	and	directions;	but	we
may	say	now	that	the	degree	is	the	most	convenient	point	of	departure	for	such	a
translation	of	space-values	into	time-values,	for,	after	all,	it	is	the	unit	of	zodiacal
measurement,	and	the	entire	fabric	of	astrological	symbolism	rests	more	or	less
upon	the	degree.

As	we	already	said,	the	degree	is,	as	it	were,	a	translation	of	time-value	into
space-value,	for	it	is	theoretically	the	orbital	space	which	the	Earth	covers	during
the	 period	 of	 time	 it	 accomplishes	 a	 total	 rotation	 around	 its	 axis,	 viz.,	 a
(sidereal)	day.	Thus	the	degree	is	a	day,	in	terms	of	spatial	measurement	along
the	 Earth’s	 orbit.	 From	 the	 day,	 we	 pass	 now	 to	 a	 year,	 saying,	 a	 day	 equals	 a
year—and	thus	a	degree	equals	a	year.	Marc	Jones	states	the	matter	most	ably	in
his	course	Directional	Astrology,	as	follows:

“The	theory	...	is	that	movement	upon	any	circle	of	celestial	motion	has
an	affinity	with	the	movement	in	any	other	related	circle	of	the	same	scheme,
and	that	the	expression	of	this	relationship	in	any	one	of	the	circles	creates	in
that	circle	an	entity	which	has	correspondence	with	the	whole	circle	in	terms
of	 units.	 Thus,	 since	 there	 are	 two	 circles	 of	 the	 heavens	 used	 for	 the
measurement	 of	 motion	 of	 the	 planets	 .	 .	 .	 the	 circles	 in	 which	 the	 diurnal
(daily)	and	annual	(yearly)	motions	of	the	earth	are	measured,	it	is	said	at	the
outset	that	a	day	corresponds	to	a	year;	and	this	is	a	correspondence	familiar

to	symbolism	of	every	sort	(as	a	year	becoming	a	day	in	the	eyes	of	God).
This	means	that	a	degree	on	the	circle	in	one	instance	equals	the	whole	of	the
other	 circle	 .	 .	 .	 and	 from	 this	 fact,	 by	 extension,	 the	 degrees	 upon	 either
circle	correspond	to	a	year	of	life.”

What	 complicates	 matters,	 where	 progressions	 and	 directions	 are	 concerned,	 is
the	fact	that	there	are	“more	days	than	degrees”	and	that	actually	the	day	does
not	correspond	to	a	whole	degree	but	on	an	average	to	59’	8”.	We	have	discussed
this	point	in	our	chapter	on	the	Degrees	of	the	Zodiac,	and	stated	that	with	the
degree,	 considered	 as	 the	 symbol	 of	 a	 fundamental	 release	 of	 creative
significance,	we	are	dealing	with	an	archetypal	value;	and	that	the	discrepancy
between	 the	 365	 or	 366	 days	 and	 the	 360	 degrees	 is	 an	 expression	 of	 the
fundamental	 “coefficient	 of	 indeterminacy”	 which	 dominates	 in	 one	 way	 or
another	any	attempt	to	translate	factors	belonging	to	one	level	or	sphere	of	being
into	factors	belonging	to	another	level	or	sphere.

When	 dealing	 with	 phenomenal	 facts	 and	 concrete	 events—as	 does	 the
ordinary	astrologer	using	directions	or	progressions-there	is	a	real	justification	in
using	 the	 ever-changing	 value	 of	 the	 space	 covered	 by	 the	 Sun	 in	 one	 day	 (it
varies	 from	 o°	 57’	 to	 1°	 1’),	 because,	 as	 we	 shall	 see,	 the	 idea	 back	 of	 these
methods	is	that	birth	is	a	progressive	event	But	in	the	case	of	the	“time-analysis
of	 a	 birth-chart”	 the	 fact	 of	 birth	 (or	 rather	 of	 the	 beginning	 of	 independent
existence	 with	 the	 first	 breath)	 is	 held	 to	 be	 altogether	 sufficient	 and	 definite.
The	 birth-chart	 is	 the	 “seed-form”	 of	 the	 individual	 selfhood.	 Thus	 it	 is
considered	 strictly	 as	 an	 archetypal	 pattern	 which	 is	 unchanging	 and	 entirely
self-contained.	 It	 refers	 to	 “being,”	 not	 to	 “becoming.”	 Therefore	 all	 its	 values
and	 all	 the	 analytical	 operations	 related	 to	 it	 should	 be	 considered	 from	 the
archetypal	level.	The	degree	is	thus	to	be	used	for	time-analysis	because	it	is	a
permanent	archetypal	value;	and	not	the	ever-changing	factor	of	the	daily	motion
of	the	Sun—or	any	such	factor—which	belongs	to	the	phenomenal	world.

The	 reader	 may	 now	 ask:	 If	 the	 birth-chart	 does	 not	 refer	 to	 “becoming,”
what	is	then	the	meaning	of	this	“time-analysis”?	Here	again	we	are	confronted
with	 a	 somewhat	 metaphysical	 problem.	 It	 can,	 however,	 be	 made	 clear	 by
referring	once	more	to	the	illustration	of	the	building	of	a	temple.	The	birth-chart
is	 the	 “blue-print”	 which	 gives	 the	 seed-form	 of	 the	 temple.	 Any	 architect
looking	at	this	blue-print	will	know	without	a	doubt	that,	if	the	temple	is	actually
to	 be	 built,	 the	 foundations	 will	 first	 have	 to	 be	 dug;	 that	 a	 certain	 class	 of
working-men	 will	 have	 to	 be	 hired	 first,	 another	 later;	 that	 a	 certain	 type	 of

material	will	have	to	be	delivered	on	the	grounds	early	in	the	operations,	another
later.	If	he	knows	the	exact	condition	of	the	business	world,	he	will	be	able	even
to	give	an	approximate	date	as	that	of	the	completion	of	the	building.

All	 these	 things	 he	 will	 know	 merely	 by	 analyzing	 the	 blueprints	 and	 by
studying	the	requirements	for	the	actualization	of	the	structure,	which	he	beholds
in	potentiality.	He	may	not	know	them	with	the	utmost	exactness,	of	course,	for
much	 will	 depend	 on	 the	 ability	 of	 the	 human	 materials	 used	 (engineers,
foremen,	workers,	etc.)	and	on	the	general	social	conditions	which	may	seriously
affect	the	building	operations.	But	he	will	know	enough	to	get	a	rather	accurate
picture	of	the	various	stages	of	operations	and	of	the	time	each	stage	will	last.

This	is	exactly	what	we	mean	by	a	“time-analysis”	of	the	birth-chart.	It	does
not	deal	with	“real	becoming”	(or	with	what	Berg-son	calls	“duration”)	because
it	 merely	 spreads	 out	 into	 a	 schedule	 of	 work	 seed-potentialities,	 which	 makes
the	 process	 relate	 to	 “mathematical	 time,”	 but	 not	 to	 “creative	 duration.”	 As	 a
matter	 of	 fact,	 such	 a	 “creative	 duration”	 is	 by	 essence	 imprevisible.	 Each
moment	 is	 new	 and	 wells	 up	 from	 an	 ocean	 of	 infinite	 potentialities	 as
unforetellable	actuality.

What,	then,	is	the	astrologer	to	do?	All	he	can	do	is	to	deal	with	probabilities
and	 with	 statistical	 averages—insofar	 as	 forecasting	 is	 concerned.	 He	 takes	 so
many	probable	views	of	the	unknown	future	process,	from	so	many	angles,	that
there	will	be	little	room	left	for	the	creative	unknowable.	But	to	sum	up	all	these
probable	 views	 will	 be	 a	 prodigious	 task;	 and	 even	 if	 the	 actual	 events	 are
correctly	 foreseen,	 there	 will	 always	 remain	 a	 mysterious	 unforeseeable	 value:
the	value	of	significance.	Granted	that	one	knows	every	step	of	the	future	destiny
of	an	individual,	what	significance	will	that	individual	have	extracted	from	his
whole	life	as	he	lies	near	death?	No	one	can	tell.	God,	even,	cannot	know.	For
God	 is	 made	 out	 of	 such	 “summing-ups	 of	 significance.”	 This	 is	 God’s
becoming—pure	 and	 creative	 duration:	 the	 unfathomable	 Mystery	 that	 is	 Life
itself.

All	 that	 our	 “time-analysis”	 can	 do	 is	 to	 see	 the	 mile-stones	 on	 the	 road	 to
personality-fulfillment.	In	some	cases	of	supreme	importance	in	the	individual’s
destiny—as	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 march	 on	 Rome	 in	 Mussolini’s	 life—the	 mile-
stones	 mark	 a	 definite	 occurrence	 which	 of	 itself,	 objectively,	 is	 a	 crucial
turning-point.	 But	 such	 cases	 are	 not	 many;	 and	 why	 should	 they	 be?	 In	 other
cases,	other	types	of	factors	 which	 serve	to	determine	the	whole	“life-process”
may	be	more	potent	in	precipitating	actual	events.	The	factors	produced	by	the

time-analysis	 of	 the	 birth-chart	 (and	 this	 time-analysis	 is	 susceptible	 of	 much
more	complex	developments	than	have	been	indicated	in	this	brief	sketch)	refer
to	 the	 archetypal	 Destiny,	 to	 that	 which	 is	 individual	 selfhood	 in	 operation:
operative	 wholeness.	 They	 deal	 with	 the	 self-contained	 manifestation	 of
potential	being.	They	are	the	most	abstract,	and	yet	the	most	powerful,	in	a	life
dominated	by	the	seed-form	of	individual	selfhood.

Before	we	come	to	investigate	progressions	and	directions	proper,	one	more
point	 is	 to	 be	 stressed.	 It	 is	 called	 to	 our	 mind	 by	 the	 fact	 that	 some	 English
astrologers	 are	 using	 this	 method	 of	 time-analysis,	 in	 various	 ways,	 under	 the
name	 of	 “symbolical	 directions.”	 This	 qualification,	 “symbolical,”	 is	 most
misleading,	 for	 it	 tends	 to	 make	 one	 believe	 that	 the	 usual	 progressions	 and
directions	 are	 not	 symbolical.	 This	 is	 a	 grievous	 error.	 All	 progressions	 and
directions	are	purely	symbolical;	and	this	fact	should	be	well	understood,	for	it	is
on	this	fact	that	the	theory	of	planetary	influences	breaks	utterly—when	the	term
“influence”	 is	 taken	 to	 mean	 the	 emanating	 of	 rays	 or	 waves	 which	 act
physically	or	psychologically	upon	a	particular	individual.

Every	 word	 of	 this	 last	 sentence	 should	 be	 considered	 carefully,	 and	 no
wrong	 or	 premature	 conclusion	 should	 be	 arrived	 at.	 All	 progressions	 and
directions	are	symbolical,	because	the	equivalence	of	a	year	to	a	day	or	to	a	four-
minute	 period	 (in	 the	 primary	 directions)	 is	 purely	 symbolical.	 How	 one	 could
fail	to	recognize	the	truth	of	this	assertion	is	hard	to	understand.	It	is	true	that	we
may	say	that	the	individual	man	(microcosmos)	is	an	image	or	correspondence	of
the	 solar	 system	 (macrocosmos),	 and	 that	 cycles	 of	 motion	 in	 the	 one	 cause
analogical	responses	in	the	other.	But	if	such	a	statement	means	anything	at	all,	it
means	that	the	solar	system	is	assumed	to	be	the	symbol	of	the	individual	man;
and	that	the	cyclic	motions	of	the	celestial	bodies	around	the	Earth	correspond	to
cyclic	 processes	 of	 the	 life-force	 in	 any	 living	 organisms	 on	 Earth.	 Obviously,
there	 is	 no	 difference	 between	 saying	 “correspond	 to”	 or	 “are	 symbols	 of.”	 If
anyone	sees	a	difference	between	these	two	phrases,	it	is	a	proof	either	that	he
has	not	understood	the	vital	reality	of	symbols—especially	of	collectively	valid
symbols	such	as	the	“primordial	images”	or	“archetypes”	of	which	Jung	speaks
—or	 that	 he	 uses	 the	 term	 “correspondence”	 without	 entering	 into	 the	 real
meaning	of	such	a	term,	often	so	loosely	used	by	students	of	occult	philosophy.

All	progressions	and	directions	are	symbolical;	and	that	is	why	any	system
“works”	 so	 well	 for	 the	 astrologer	 who	 has	 identified	 himself	 with	 it	 (who
believes	thoroughly	in	it),	and	not	so	well	for	one	who	is	not	used	to	the	“feel”	of
it.	In	medical	practice,	likewise,	a	drug	cures	much	more	readily	a	patient	who

has	 “faith”	 in	 it	 than	 one	 who	 takes	 it	 half-heartedly—and	 by	 “faith,”	 I	 do	 not
mean	 merely	 a	 conscious	 belief	 that	 the	 medicine	 will	 cure,	 but	 rather	 an
unconscious	yearning	 to	 be	 healed	 which	 fastens	 upon	 the	 medicine	 as	 upon	 a
symbol	 of	 salvation.	 The	 same	 is	 true	 also	 with	 regard	 to	 spiritual	 healing,
religious	 conversion	 and	 all	 instances	 of	 profound	 “life-metamorphosis.”	 They
occur	 because	 the	 deep	 powers	 of	 the	 inner	 life	 (call	 it	 “unconscious”	 or
whatever	you	will!)	have	become	concentrated	around	a	“symbol,”	an	image	of
salvation	or	of	self-renewal.	Not	an	abstract	idea,	let	us	well	understand,	 but	a
concrete,	 visualizable,	 sensorially	 evident	 image.	 Thus	 the	 validity	 of	 the
“personal	 God”	 idea,	 or	 of	 the	 guru	 or	 “spiritual	 teachers”—all	 images	 and
symbols	of	operative	wholeness,	viz.,	of	healing	and	salvation.

Trouble	begins	when	the	symbol	is	taken	as	a	material	reality,	because	then
the	person	begins	to	believe	that	an	external	entity	is	influencing	him	from	some
outside	 basis	 of	 tangibility.	 “Saturn	 is	 crucifying	 me!”	 clamors	 the	 astrological
devotee.	 “A	 black	 magician	 is	 persecuting	 me!”	 sobs	 the	 frightened	 would-be
occultist.	And	fear	creeps	in	and	disintegrates	the	personality.	Neither	Saturn	nor
the	black	magician	has	any	meaning	for	any	person,	save	as	a	symbol	of	a	phase
of	 the	 life-process	 through	 which	 every	 human	 being	 must	 pass,	 at	 this	 or	 that
level	of	being.

In	 other	 words,	 the	 frightening	 “square	 of	 Saturn	 to	 Sun”	 or	 the	 “black
magician”	are	happenings	that	have	reality	within	the	sphere	of	the	personality.
That	is	why	sane	books	on	occultism	say	that	the	“black	master”	is	not	incarnate,
but	 functions	 on	 the	 mental	 plane.	 This	 is	 a	 way	 of	 saying—according	 to	 the
peculiar	 terminology	 of	 occult	 philosophy—that	 such	 a	 nefarious	 Power	 is	 a
symbol	(or	archetype)	which,	at	certain	periods	in	the	process	of	individuation,	is
activated	within	the	psyche.	Likewise,	at	a	certain	period	of	the	worm’s	life	its
outer	skin	hardens,	and,	within	what	has	then	become	a	chrysalis,	a	process	of
utter	 organic	 disintegration	 occurs,	 until	 the	 chrysalis	 is	 only	 a	 hard	 skin	 filled
with	 a	 jellied	 substance.	 But	 out	 of	 this	 apparently	 inchoate	 jelly	 the	 butterfly
will	soon	form	the	glory	of	wings.

Such	 is	 the	 symbolical	 story	 of	 the	 soul,	 as	 known	 to	 millennia	 of	 human
endeavors	toward	the	spiritual	state.	The	worm	might	well	say:	“O	horrible	fate!
Saturn	conjoins	my	Sun,	and	see	how	my	soft	skin	hardens!”	And	a	little	later
might	cry	in	utter	anguish:	“Help	me!	My	progressed	Sun	is	coming	to	Neptune,
and	see,	all	of	me	is	dissolving	into	a	jelly!”	Indeed	Saturn	and	Neptune	would
be	adequate	“figures	of	speech,”	valid	symbols	of	what	is	happening.	Chemical
symbols	 might	 just	 as	 effectively	 be	 used	 to	 describe	 the	 occurrence;	 or	 a

symphonic	sequence	in	which	the	normal	tonal	structure	would	give	place	to	an
atonal	and	dissonant	development.	All	are	symbols—symbols	of	the	rhythm	of
the	 life-process	 which	 brings	 alike	 to	 galaxies,	 to	 worms	 or	 to	 human	 psyches
calculable	periods	of	transformation.	Astrological	progressions	or	directions	are
symbolical	 means	 of	 calculating	 the	 time	 of	 occurrence,	 and	 the	 duration,	 of
such	periods;	and	as	such	are	extremely	valuable	for	the	man	who	wishes	to	live
in	 terms	 of	 conscious	 significance.	 They	 are	 utterly	 or	 spiritually	 valueless	 for
any	 other	 purpose.	 Nothing	 is	 to	 be	 done	 about	 them,	 or	 with	 them,	 save	 to
understand	and	to	be	more	conscious.	All	else	is	illusion.

### The	Formation	of	Progressions,	Directions	and	Transits

Progressions	and	directions	are	based	on	an	analysis	of	the	actual	motion	of
planets	or	cusps	after	the	moment	of	birth.	They	are	based	on	the	idea	that	birth
is	not	a	final	gesture	and	that	the	act	of	birthing	prolongs	itself	in	time,	spreads
over	a	period	of	hours	(primary	directions)	or	days	(secondary	progressions),	and
in	doing	so	affords	a	means	to	foretell	the	actual	occurrences	that	will	become
objectivized	during	the	whole	life-span.

This	 is	 a	 most	 important	 point,	 not	 usually	 understood.	 All	 progressions	 or
directions	involving	the	study	of	actual	planetary	motion	after	birth	(first-breath
moment)	imply	that	the	individual	is	not	yet	a	complete	personality	by	virtue	of
his	 first	 breath.	 Individuation	 is	 not	 completed	 then.	 And	 it	 takes	 some	 time
more,	more	breathing,	before	it	is	completed.	Thus	living	is	seen	as	a	process	of
fulfillment.	 This	 process,	 from	 a	 cosmic	 or	 spiritual	 point	 of	 view,	 reaches	 as
perfect	 a	 completion	 as	 the	 individual	 can	 reach	 in	 the	 body	 just	 beginning	 to
live	as	an	independent	organism,	in	a	few	hours	after	birth,	and	in	a	few	weeks
after	 birth	 —this	 according	 as	 we	 put	 ourselves	 at	 the	 level	 of	 the	 individual
factor	or	at	the	level	of	the	collective	factor.

This	may	seem	a	difficult	point	to	understand;	yet	it	is	very	simple,	if	only
we	 realize	 that	 man	 as	 a	 personality	 (body	 plus	 psyche)	 is	 the	 result	 of	 the
interaction	of	individual	and	collective	factors.	These	factors	can	be	considered
separately,	for	each	class	operates	at	a	certain	level	of	being;	or,	let	us	say,	has	its
own	 rhythm	 of	 being.	 Now	 the	 rhythm	 of	 being	 of	 the	 individual	 factors	 is
related	 to,	 and	 symbolized	 in	 astrology	 by,	 the	 axial	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth:	 the
day-and-night	rhythm.	On	the	other	hand,	the	rhythm	of	being	of	the	collective
factors	 is	 related	 to	 and	 symbolized	 by	 the	 orbital	 revolution	 of	 the	 Earth:	 the
rhythm	of	the	seasons.

Thus	 we	 start	 with	 the	 idea:	 The	 first	 breath	 is	 not	 sufficient	 to	 establish

fulfillment	of	personality.	Next	point:	When	will	this	personality	reach	 relative
fulfillment?	 In	 order	 to	 answer	 this	 we	 have	 to	 analyze	 personality	 into	 its
component	factors;	and	we	shall	answer:

### 1)	The	individual	factor	will	reach	relative	fulfillment	in	a	few	minutes	or

hours.

### 2)	The	collective	factor	will	reach	relative	fulfillment	in	a	few	days	or

weeks.

3)	And	the	organism,	in	and	through	which	these	two	factors	are	related	as
actual	behavior	in	the	midst	of	the	larger	whole	of	human	society,	will
operate	as	an	organism	(i.e.,	as	body	and	psyche)	for	so	many	years	or
decades.

Fulfillment	in	the	individual	factor	seems	fastest	because	it	is	related	to	the
axial	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth,	 and	 not	 (as	 is	 the	 collective	 factor)	 with	 the	 orbital
revolution	of	the	Earth.	But	let	us	not	forget	that	we	said,	a	few	pages	back,	that
fulfillment	is	relatively	absolute	and	does	not	depend	upon	values	such	as	big	or
small,	 short	 or	 long.	 If	 you	 place	 yourself	 looking	 at	 the	 horizon	 or	 at	 the
meridian,	you	will	see	all	the	zodiac	pass	before	your	eyes	within	24	hours;	and
astrologically	speaking,	that	means	that	you	have	reached	total	fulfillment—for
the	zodiac	symbolizes	the	circle	of	perfect	wholeness.

But,	 from	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 orbital	 revolution	 and	 of	 the	 rhythm	 of	 the
seasons,	you	will	see	the	whole	zodiac	pass	in	the	line	of	the	relationship	Earth-
to-Sun	(which	symbolizes	the	collective,	organic	and	vital	factor)	only	after	one
year’s	time.	Thus	you	will	reach	perfect	wholeness	only	after	a	whole	year.	But
wholeness	is	wholeness	irrespective	of	the	size	or	duration	of	the	whole	in	which
it	manifests.	So,	from	the	point	of	view	of	wholeness,	a	complete	cycle	of	axial
rotation	(a	sidereal	day)	and	a	complete	cycle	of	orbital	revolution	(a	solar	year)
are	analogical—	because	they	both	represent	the	experience	of	the	whole	zodiac.
To	experience	the	whole	zodiac,	for	the	individual	self,	is	to	progress	through
24	hours	of	“in-breathing”	after	birth.	It	is	to	breathe-in	the	whole	zodiac	as	seen
from	the	point	of	view	of	the	Earth’s	rotation.

To	 experience	 the	 whole	 zodiac	 for	 the	 collective-organic	 being	 is	 to
progress	through	a	complete	cycle	of	solar	and	seasonal	changes,	a	full	year.	It	is
to	experience	the	full	cycle	of	vegetable	life—for	this	collective,	organic	being
in	us	is,	archetypally	speaking,	a	plant	or	a	tree;	a	point	the	discussion	of	which
is	outside	of	the	scope	of	this	book.

We	 can	 carry	 the	 analogy	 further	 and	 consider	 the	 cycle	 of	 gyration	 of	 the
Earth’s	 axis,	 the	 Great	 Polar	 Cycle	 (precessional	 cycle)	 of	 25,868	 years.	 This,
too,	constitutes	a	whole	“cycle	of	experience,”	and	it	is	“zodiacal”	at	least	in	the
sense	that	every	meridian	of	our	planet	during	that	cycle	comes,	by	precession,
in	 conjunction	 with	 every	 degree	 of	 the	 zodiac	 in	 turn.	 (This	 is	 the	 same	 as
saying	that	the	vernal	point	comes	in	contact	successively	with	every	meridian.)

We	 have	 thus	 three	 cycles,	 each	 of	 which	 represents	 a	 fullness	 of	 zodiacal
experience;	each	of	which	can	be	said	to	be	symbolically	equal	or	analogical	to
the	others:	the	sidereal	day,	the	solar	year,	and	the	Great	Polar	Cycle.	They	refer
respectively	 to	 the	 individual	 factor,	 the	 collective	 factor	 and	 the	 planetary
factor.	 But	 we	 saw	 previously	 that	 when	 speaking	 of	 the	 planetary	 factor	 we
referred	to	the	life	of	the	“Planetary	Individual”	whose	“I	amness”	is	symbolized
by	 the	 axis	 of	 rotation	 of	 the	 earth:	 the	 polar	 axis.	 Thus	 a	 whole	 Great	 Polar
Cycle	is	the	cycle	of	fulfillment	of	the	individual	factor	in	the	Planetary	Being,
whom	we	may	call	the	“Planetary	Logos”	or	“God.”	And	here	we	are	confronted
with	 a	 very	 interesting,	 if	 rather	 puzzling	 situation.	 If	 the	 reader	 refers	 to	 our
study	 of	 the	 Great	 Polar	 Cycle	 (p.	 154),	 he	 will	 see	 that	 we	 produced	 two
alternatives	 of	 subdivision	 for	 this	 cycle.	 If	 we	 divide	 it	 according	 to	 the
vibratory	periods	referred	to	as	“nutation”	we	have	a	division	of	the	whole	cycle
into,	let	us	say,	70	periods	of	370	solar	years	(20	cycles	of	the	Moon’s	nodes).
But	 if	 we	 follow	 what	 H.	 P.	 Blavatsky	 claims	 to	 be	 the	 “esoteric	 calculation”
(presumably	substantiated	by	the	quotation	from	the	Kabbala),	we	have	instead	a
division	into	370	periods	of	70	years.

This	 is	 most	 interesting	 in	 reference	 to	 our	 present	 problem;	 for	 we	 have
there	 two	 values	 (370	 and	 70)	 which	 can	 be	 taken	 as	 the	 archetypal	 lengths	 of
the	 human	 personality-cycle.	 Both	 are	 true,	 only	 they	 refer	 to	 different	 things.
Seventy	 years	 (three-score	 and	 ten)	 constitute	 the	 karmic	 period	 of	 individual
manifestation	in	personality	(i.e.,	the	cycle	of	our	individual	relationship	to	the
Planetary	Individual).	Three	hundred	and	seventy	years	constitute	the	period	of
manifestation	of	archetypal	personality:	personality	as	a	spiritual	organism,	as	a
perfected	permanent	structure	ready	to	become	a	cell	of	the	Planetary	Being.

The	 subject	 cannot	 here	 be	 discussed	 fully,	 but	 we	 had	 to	 bring	 it	 up
inasmuch	 as	 it	 leads	 to	 the	 recognition	 of	 this	 “esoteric”	 cycle	 of	 370	 years
which	is	the	true	cycle	of	fulfillment	of	the	personality.	Obviously,	no	ordinary
personality	 (since	 the	 time	 of	 the	 Patriarchs)	 reaches	 such	 a	 length	 of
manifestation	 in	 the	 body;	 but	 this	 is	 the	 very	 reason	 why	 no	 ordinary

personality,	 at	 this	 stage	 of	 planetary	 evolution,	 reaches	 fulfillment	 as	 a
personality.

And	 this	 is	 just	 what	 astrological	 progressions	 point	 out;	 for	 by	 their
traditional	equating	of	“a	day	after	birth,	or	4	minutes	after	birth,	for	a	year	of
the	life-process”	it	is	seen	at	once	that	no	cycle	of	progressions	or	directions	is
ever	fulfilled.	In	other	words,	the	individual	 factor	 in	man	does	 not	 experience
the	whole	zodiac,	but	only,	let	us	say,	70	degrees	of	it	measured	on	the	cycle	of
the	Earth’s	axial	rotation.	The	collective	factor,	likewise,	experiences	70	degrees
of	the	zodiac—measured	on	the	circle	of	the	Earth’s	orbital	revolution.	And	the
personality	can	“keep	body	and	soul	together”	for	only	70	years—out	of	a	cycle
of	total	fulfillment	of	370	years.

We	 have,	 in	 other	 words,	 three	 cycles	 of	 fulfillment:	 the	 sidereal	 day,	 the
solar	 year	 and	 the	 personality-fulfillment	 cycle	 of	 370	 years.	 These	 can	 be
considered	as	analogical	(or	“equal”)	in	terms	of	fulfillment.	A	unit	in	one	cycle
corresponds	 to	 a	 unit	 in	 the	 other	 cycles.	 The	 unit	 of	 the	 sidereal	 day	 (axial
rotation)	is	a	4-minute	period	during	which	the	meridian	moves	the	space	of	one
zodiacal	degree.	 The	 unit	of	the	solar	year	(orbital	 revolution)	is	 the	solar	 day,
during	which	the	Sun	appears	to	move	on	an	average	of	59°	8’.	And	these	two
units	are	said	to	correspond	to	a	year	of	the	personality-life.*

The	“day	equals	a	year”	calculation	is	backed	up	by	the	fact,	often	mentioned
already,	 that	 for	 the	 “polar	 axis”—which	 symbolizes	 the	 planetary	 “I	 AM”—a
year	is	like	unto	a	day	(6-months	daylight	and	6-months	darkness,	theoretically).
So	if	four	minutes	are	analogous	to	a	day,	and	a	day	is	equal	to	a	year,	therefore
four	 minutes	 correspond	 also	 to	 a	 year—as	 is	 understood	 in	 “primary
directions.”

The	 main	 points	 to	 grasp	 in	 such	 a	 complex	 problem	 are:	 1)	 that	 “primary
directions”	refer	to	the	cycle	of	axial	rotation	of	the	Earth	and	to	the	individual
factor	 in	 man;	 2)	 that	 “secondary	 progressions”	 refer	 to	 the	 cycle	 of	 orbital
revolution	 and	 to	 the	 collective	 factor	 in	 man;	 3)	 that	 both	 are	 related
expressions	 of	 the	 fact	 that	 birth	 does	 not	 mean	 the	 fulfillment	 of	 personality,
and	 that	 therefore	 birth	 is	 a	 continuing	 process	 which	 goes	 on	 at	 three	 levels:
individual,	collective	and	organic	(personality);	4)	that	each	of	these	three	levels,
or	 factors	 of	 being,	 has	 its	 own	 rhythm	 of	 development,	 which	 relates	 it
respectively	 to	 a	 cycle	 of	 fulfillment.	 Thus	 the	 phases	 of	 development	 of	 the
individual	 factor	 can	 be	 determined	 from	 planetary	 positions,	 after	 birth,	 along
the	 cycle	 of	 axial	 rotation.	 The	 phases	 of	 development	 of	 the	 collective	 factor

can	be	determined	from	planetary	positions,	after	birth,	along	the	cycle	of	orbital
revolution.	 And	 the	 phases	 of	 development	 of	 the	 personality,	 insofar	 as	 it	 is
determinable	 by	 social	 and	 planetary	 environment,	 can	 be	 computed	 from	 the
positions	of	the	celestial	bodies	year	after	year—i.e.,	along	its	370-year	cycle	of
fulfillment.	Such	positions	are	what	are	called	“transits.”

This,	then,	gives	us	three	basic	methods	of	determining	the	phases	of	the	life-
process	 which	 continues,	 prolongs	 and	 leads	 to	 the	 relative	 fulfillment	 of	 the
human	being,	the	structural	pattern	of	which	is	shown	in	the	birth-chart:	Primary
directions,	secondary	progressions,	transits.

In	 these	 three	 cases	 the	 same	 procedure	 is	 used,	 generally	 speaking;
planetary	 positions	 are	 calculated	 for	 any	 period	 of	 time	 desired,	 and	 the	 new
positions	thus	obtained	(progressed,	directed,	transiting	positions)	are	compared
to	 the	 radical	 or	 birth	 positions;	 or,	 in	 some	 cases,	 are	 considered	 in	 their	 new
mutual	relationships.	“Aspects”	are	thus	determined	which	define	or	characterize
the	life-process	or	the	general	life-conditioning	in	a	given	year,	month	or	day	of
the	 life.	 In	 every	 case	 new	planetary	 factors	 are	 generated	 by	 the	 use	 of	 these
methods,	which	either	supersede,	or	more	ordinarily	modify,	the	significance	of
the	 twenty-four	 original	 factors	 constituting	 the	 birth-chart;	 whereas	 in	 the
previously	 studied	 method	 of	 the	 “time-analysis	 of	 the	 birth-chart,”	 the	 only
factors	 used	 are	 these	 twenty-four	 primary	 factors,	 or	 else	 secondary	 factors
produced	by	the	combination	of	the	primary	factors.

From	 what	 has	 been	 said	 throughout	 this	 chapter,	 a	 more	 or	 less	 definite
understanding	of	the	value	and	the	relative	meaning	of	the	basic	methods	used	in
astrology	 to	 express	 the	 factor	 of	 time	 and	 of	 becoming	 has	 presumably	 been
acquired.	We	shall,	however,	return	to	this	complex	question	as	we	sum	up	our
discussion	concerning	the	use	and	interpretation	of	birth-chart	and	progressions
(generally	 speaking)	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 great	 goal	 of	 the	 integration	 and
fulfillment	 of	 personality.	 But	 before	 we	 reach	 this	 point	 it	 seems	 necessary	 to
give	 some	 more	 attention	 to	 the	 technique	 of	 progressions,	 directions	 and
transits,	so	that	the	reader	may	become	more	familiar	with	them	and	with	their
relative	importance	and	significance.

## THE	TECHNIQUE	OF	PROGRESSIONS,
## DIRECTIONS	AND	TRANSITS

Secondary	Progressions
These	 progressions	 are	 the	 most	 generally	 used	 today,	 and	 will	 be	 found
explained	 in	 any	 good	 astrological	 text-book.	 Their	 technique	 is	 quite	 simple,
and	 all	 the	 factors	 required	 are	 found	 in	 an	 ordinary	 astrological	 ephemeris.
What	they	measure	primarily	are	changes	in	the	relation	Earth-to-Sun;	that	is,	in
the	 relation	 of	 organism	 to	 organizing	 life-principle.	 This	 relation	 evolves
constantly	through	the	life-process.	It	is	different	in	youth,	in	mature	life,	and	in
old	 age.	 An	 index	 to	 the	 significance	 and	 mode	 of	 operation	 of	 this	 constantly
changing	Earth-to-Sun	relationship	is	found	in	the	“progressed	Sun”—its	degree,
sign	and	house	position,	also	in	the	aspects	it	makes	to	other	planets.

Secondary	progressions	are	calculated	with	reference	to	the	apparent	motion
of	the	Sun,	and	the	solar	day—from	noon	to	noon	—is	the	basic	unit.	One	such
unit	 is	 said	 to	 equal	 one	 year	 of	 life.	 As	 the	 daily	 motion	 of	 the	 Sun	 is	 not	 a
constant,	 its	 exact	 value	 has	 to	 be	 found	 in	 the	 ephemeris.	 The	 position	 of	 the
Sun	 each	 day	 after	 the	 day	 of	 birth	 gives	 the	 position	 of	 the	 “progressed	 Sun”
during	each	year	after	birth.

Secondary	 progressions	 refer	 to	 the	 orbital	 motion	 of	 the	 Earth,	 thus	 to	 the
apparent	motion	of	the	Sun	on	the	ecliptic.	The	solar	factor	therefore	completely
dominates	these	progressions.	It	is	a	factor	of	integration,	as	the	Sun	stands	for
the	vital	principle	in	the	body,	or	for	the	Self	within	the	total	personality.

What	is	shown	in	the	“progressed	Sun”	is	the	manner	in	which	the	process	of
personality-integration	is	carried	on	after	birth;	how	the	substance	of	collective
being,	in	the	midst	of	which	the	individual	grows,	is	being	“assimilated”	by	the
individual—a	 process	 leading	 to	 the	 maturity	 and	 completion	 of	 a	 full
personality.	Solar	progressions	deal	therefore	with	the	development	of	the	Self-
in-manifestation.	 They	 deal	 with	 the	 various	 stages	 of	 embodiment	 of	 the

integrative	 monadic	 Will;	 also	 with	 the	 modifications	 of	 the	 life-principle	 as	 it
controls	 the	 processes	 of	 the	 physiological	 organism.	 From	 the	 standpoint	 of
personality-fulfillment	they	are	the	most	important	progressions—more	so	than
as	 prognostications	 of	 concrete	 events.	 Secondary	 progressions	 are	 above	 all
solar	in	implication,	and	nothing	can	really	be	obtained	from	them	which	does
not	 somewhat	 partake	 of	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 solar	 factor	 in	 action.	 As	 the	 Sun
represents	 the	 factor	 of	 integration,	 it	 is	 easy	 to	 see	 that	 “secondary
progressions”	are	the	most	significant	in	relation	to	the	psychological-alchemical
Great	Work.

Most	 valuable	 testimonies	 can	 also	 be	 obtained	 from	 the	 positions	 of	 the
planets	 and	 the	 Moon—provided	 those	 are	 always	 considered	 as	 somewhat
subservient	 to	 the	 solar	 factor.	 Progressed	 planets	 indicate	 how	 the	 types	 of
activity	 which	 they	 represent	 co-operate	 in	 the	 general	 solar	 process	 of
fulfillment.	 Progressions	 of	 Mercury	 reveal	 the	 attitude	 of	 the	 mind	 and	 the
mental	faculties	in	the	“Great	Work”	of	the	solar	Alchemist	within.	Progressions
of	 Venus	 refer	 to	 emotional	 reactions	 and	 esthetic	 responses;	 those	 of	 Mars,	 to
the	 power	 of	 initiative	 and	 spontaneous	 impulsion;	 of	 Jupiter,	 to	 the
compensatory	 soul-revealing	 activities	 of	 the	 psyche;	 of	 Saturn,	 to	 the	 slow
transformations	of	the	very	structure	of	the	field	of	the	conscious;	of	Uranus,	to
the	downflow	of	transforming,	regenerative	forces	from	the	hidden	world	within;
of	 Neptune,	 to	 the	 dissolving	 of	 limitations	 and	 the	 birth	 of	 universal
consciousness	 (metamorphosis);	 of	 Pluto,	 theoretically,	 to	 the	 possibility	 of	 a
second	birth.

As	 for	 the	 progressed	 Moon,	 it	 is	 that	 which,	 of	 all	 progressed	 planetary
factors,	most	specifically	refers	to	concrete	events.	It	indicates	outer	changes,	the
working	out	of	cycles	of	past	karma,	the	opening,	closing	and	culmination	of	the
outer	phases	of	the	life-process.	As	it	passes	over	the	cusps	of	houses	(this	is	also
true	to	a	lesser	extent	of	all	progressed	planets)	it	measures	definite	changes	in
the	concrete	emphases	of	life.	This	is	especially	marked	as	the	Moon	crosses	the
four	angles,	and	most	of	all,	the	Ascendant.

But	even	the	most	powerful	and	most	factual	of	all	such	progressions,	Moon
conjunction	 Ascendant,	 does	 not	 always	 refer	 to	 a	 concrete	 change.	 Often	 the
time	 of	 the	 decision	 which	 leads	 to	 the	 change	 is	 that	 which	 is	 indicated.	 At
times	 the	 change	 is	 most	 potent,	 yet	 outwardly	 unrecognized	 by	 the	 native—
especially	if	he	belongs	to	the	introvert	type.	This	is	so	because,	even	in	the	case
of	the	Moon	(a	solar	reflector,	in	a	sense)	the	meaning	of	the	occurrence	has	to
be	 related	 to	 the	 progressed	 Sun.	 The	 symbol	 of	 the	 degree	 of	 this	 progressed

Sun	 gives	 one	 of	 the	 best—if	 sometimes	 elusive—indications	 of	 the	 spiritual
significance	 of	 the	 approximate	 twelve	 months	 to	 which	 a	 full	 degree	 of	 solar
progression	corresponds.

Before	we	leave	this	type	of	“secondary	progressions’—the	detailed	study	of
which	would	require	a	small	book—an	important	point	needs	be	mentioned.	We
have	not	so	far	made	clear	the	actual	procedure	by	means	of	which	such	a	phrase
as	“progression	of	Venus”	can	be	given	factual	meaning.	How	shall	we	discover
the	nature	of	the	progressions	of	Venus?	By	reference	to	what?	Two	possibilities
are	 evident.	 The	 progressed	 Venus	 is	 considered	 either	 as	 making	 aspects	 with
the	other	progressed	planets	of	the	same	progressed	day-period,	or	as	coming	to
form	 definite	 relations	 with	 the	 planets	 at	 their	 original	 (radical)	 places	 in	 the
birth-chart.	For	instance,	if	the	native	is	born	on	January	1,	1935,	his	radical	Sun
is	 in	 Capricorn	 10	 and	 Jupiter	 in	 Scorpio	 16°	 56’.	 By	 the	 time	 he	 is	 seven	 (in
1942)	 his	 progressed	 Sun	 will	 have	 reached	 the	 Sun’s	 position	 marked	 in	 the
ephemeris	 for	 January	 8	 as	 Capricorn	 17.	 At	 this	 same	 date	 the	 progressed
Jupiter	will	be	in	Scorpio	18°	5’.	Now	a	sextile	has	been	formed	early,	January	8,
between	the	progressed	Sun	and	the	radical	Jupiter	(between	Capricorn	16°	56’
and	Scorpio	16°	56’).	This	is	seen	to	take	place	in	the	“life-process”	in	1942.

If,	 however,	 we	 wish	 to	 consider	 the	 sextile	 of	 progressed	 Sun	 and
progressed	Jupiter,	then	we	shall	have	to	wait	until	January	9	—when	these	two
planets	are	found	located	respectively	on	Capricorn	18°	13’	and	Scorpio	18°	13’.
This	postpones	the	actualization	or	fulfillment	of	the	natal	Sun-sextile-Jupiter	in
the	native’s	life	to	the	year	1943.	If,	instead	of	Jupiter,	which	moves	slowly,	we
had	 taken	 a	 fast	 moving	 planet,	 the	 discrepancy	 between	 the	 dates	 of
consummation	 of	 progressed-to-radical-planet	 and	 progressed-to-progressed-
planet	 aspects	 would	 have	 been	 greater.	 The	 question	 is	 then:	 Which	 type	 of
aspect	should	we	select;	and	if,	as	is	commonly	done,	both	types	are	considered,
should	there	be	a	difference	between	the	two?

Here—as	 on	 many	 other	 occasions!—astrologers	 differ.	 Most	 of	 them
recognize	 the	 validity	 of	 both	 procedures,	 but	 some	 think	 one	 type	 is	 more
effective,	 others,	 the	 other	 type.	 As	 always,	 we	 shall	 try	 to	 look	 logically	 and
philosophically	into	the	matter.	If	we	calculate	aspects	between	progressed	and
radical	 planetary	 positions,	 what	 we	 do	 is	 to	 conceive	 the	 radical	 chart	 as	 a
permanent	 pattern	 so	 indelibly	 imprinted	 in	 the	 personality	 that	 it	 creates
psychically	 and	 physiologically	 sensitive	 points	 significant	 enough	 to	 stand	 as
foci	 of	 distribution	of	energy.	As	the	progressed	planets	strike	 these	points	(by
conjunction,	 opposition,	 square,	 etc.)	 a	 significance	 is	 released	 in	 terms	 of	 the

planetary	 activity.	 In	 other	 words,	 the	 radical	 planets	 are	 seen	 as	 permanent
centers	 of	 energy	 which	 become	 activated,	 stirred,	 aroused	 (in	 one	 way	 or
another)	as	progressed	planets	come	into	definite	aspect	to	them.

Thus	a	significant	relationship	is	established	between	a	value	of	knowledge,
being,	 space,	 individual	 selfhood	 (radical	 places)	 and	 a	 value	 of	 fulfillment,
time,	 becoming,	 life-flux	 (progressed	 planet).	 If,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 two
progressed	 planets	 are	 related	 by	 aspect,	 then	 the	 relationship	 is	 between	 two
values	 of	 the	 latter	 type.	 Therefore	 by	 considering	 such	 progressed-to-
progressed-planet	 aspects	 we	 are	 navigating	 wholly	 in	 the	 boundless	 flux	 of
“becoming,”	without	any	anchorage	to	the	seed-form	of	“being.”	We	are	apt	to
scatter	 our	 interpretation,	 to	 lose	 the	 sense	 of	 pur-posefulness	 which	 is	 the
keynote	of	a	proper	approach	to	the	secondary	progressions.

In	the	secondary	progressions	we	see	the	purpose	of	“being”	at	work	through
the	 “becoming.”	 The	 various	 positions	 of	 the	 “progressed	 Sun”	 on	 each
successive	degree	of	the	zodiac	after	the	day	of	birth	show	the	evolution	of	the
purpose	of	the	life-activities	in	the	midst	of	change:	purpose	as	it	slowly	perfects
and	 refines	 itself	 throughout	 the	 life.	 The	 time-analysis	 of	 the	 birth-chart	 also
revealed	such	a	purpose,	but	in	a	more	archetypal,	subjective	and	abstract	sense.
In	 the	 secondary	 progressions	 we	 see	 the	 purpose	 of	 being	 unfolding	 itself	 by
actual	 steps;	 thus	 the	 discrepancy	 between	 calculations	 obtained	 by	 following
both	methods.

Each	 degree	 of	 progression	 of	 the	 Sun	 strikes	 a	 new	 aspect	 of	 this	 life-
purpose	(symbolized	in	the	degree	of	the	radical	Sun	—and,	in	another	sense,	in
that	of	the	Ascendant);	and	as	this	occurs	the	radical	“planetary	pattern”	slowly
changes	its	form,	to	fit	in,	as	it	were,	with	this	new	purpose.	If	the	original	seed-
form	 of	 being	 (birth-chart)	 actually	 dominates	 the	 whole	 development	 of
personality—as	it	does	for	instance	in	men	completely	overshadowed	by	a	super-
personal	 mission—then	 progressed	 positions	 must	 be	 referred	 almost	 solely	 to
the	radical	places	of	the	planets;	for	the	original	purpose	is	absolutely	constant
and	ever	active.	But	if,	in	the	course	of	the	life-time,	the	personality	experiences
profound	 changes	 of	 purpose,	 real	 metamorphoses	 of	 being,	 then	 aspects	 of
progressed-to-radical-planets	 are	 less	 valid,	 and	 aspects	 of	 progressed-to-
progressed-planets	more	significant	of	actual	changes.

These	directions	have	been	presented	by	astrological	text-books	in	so	many
different	 ways,	 and	 they	 involve,	 as	 usually	 taught,	 such	 an	 array	 of

### Primary	Directions

mathematical	computations,	that	the	student	of	astrology	may	well	find	himself
baffled	by	the	labor	of	calculating	them.	The	scope	of	this	book	does	not	permit
a	 detailed	 or	 precise	 presentation	 of	 these	 primary	 directions.	 But	 a	 few	 points
may	be	brought	out	to	indicate	how	they	fit	into	the	larger	scheme	of	astrological
interpretation.

Primary	 directions,	 generally	 speaking,	 refer	 to	 the	 factor	 of	 individual
selfhood,	 because	 they	 are	 calculated	 along	 the	 cycle	 of	 axial	 rotation	 of	 the
Earth.	 They	 refer	 to	 the	 process	 of	 fulfillment	 of	 this	 individual	 factor.	 In	 this
process,	a	degree	of	motion	is	again	equated	to	a	year	of	the	life.	But	the	moving
factor	is	no	longer	the	Sun,	the	index	of	the	orbital	revolution	of	the	Earth	(as	it
was	 in	 the	 Secondary	 progressions),	 but	 instead,	 the	 meridian	 (or	 Mid-Heaven
point	 in	 the	 chart).	 The	 meridian	 moves	 at	 a	 rate	 of	 one	 degree	 per	 4-minute
period,	 completing	 a	 circuit	 in	 24	 sidereal	 hours.	 Thus	 this	 4-minute	 period	 is
assumed	to	correspond	to	a	year	of	the	life.

During	such	a	period,	obviously,	the	motion	of	the	planets	in	their	orbits	is
practically	nil.	Thus,	in	some	systems,	they	are	considered	to	be	absolutely	fixed,
insofar	 as	 their	 zodiacal	 positions	 are	 concerned.	 Their	 motion	 is	 produced	 by
the	rotation	of	the	Earth,	which,	as	it	were,	lifts	up	the	whole	planetary	pattern
and	turns	it	around	as	one	would	turn	a	radio	dial.	We	might	say	that	every	four
minutes	a	small	one-degree	motion	is	given	to	the	whole	pattern.	As	a	result,	the
whole	 pattern	 occupies	 new	 positions	 in	 terms	 of	 zodiacal	 degrees.	 These	 new
positions	 are	 related	 to	 the	 original	 positions	 and	 aspects	 calculated	 between
original	(radical)	and	new	(directed)	positions.	Thus	Saturn	by	directed	position
may	become	square	to	Sun	by	radical	position	after	ten	little	one-degree	turns	of
the	dial.	And	this	would	mean	that	ten	years	after	birth	the	individual	factor	in
the	 native’s	 personality	 will	 experience	 a	 crisis	 of	 fulfillment	 expressible	 in
terms	of	Saturn	square	Sun.

If	this	were	actually	the	whole	mechanism	of	primary	directions	it	would	be
identical	in	operation	(if	not	in	principle)	with	the	technique	of	our	time-analysis
of	 the	 birth-chart.	 But	 matters	 are	 much	 more	 complex.	 First	 of	 all,	 because
directions	are	formed	actually	along	the	circle	of	the	Earth’s	axial	rotation	which
is	 the	 equator,	 the	 positions	 of	 the	 apparently	 moving	 planets	 have	 to	 be
calculated	in	reference	to	the	equatorial	circle,	and	not	to	the	ecliptic	(the	path	of
the	 apparent	 motion	 of	 the	 Sun).	 This	 means	 that	 the	 positions	 of	 the	 planets
must	 be	 expressed	 in	 terms	 of	 Right	 Ascension	 (distance	 from	 the	 vernal
equinox	on	the	equator),	and	not	in	terms	of	longitude	(distance	from	the	vernal
equinox	on	the	ecliptic).

Therefore	 the	 radical	 positions	 of	 the	 planets	 must	 be	 recalculated—by	 the
use	of	special	tables,	taking	also	in	consideration	the	latitude	of	the	planets—and
they	 will	 be	 found	 on	 new	 degrees	 of	 the	 zodiac.	 The	 new	 positions,	 by
directional	 motion,	 will	 also	 be	 expressed	 in	 terms	 of	 Right	 Ascension.	 The
aspects	 will	 thus	 be	 computed	 between	 the	 two	 Right-Ascensional	 positions,
radical	 and	 directed.	 Such	 a	 type	 of	 computation	 offers	 the	 simplest	 type	 of
primary	 directions.	 Symbolically	 speaking,	 they	 are	 the	 creation	 of	 the	 regular
motion	of	the	meridian,	and	thus	carry,	as	it	were,	the	significance	of	the	Mid-
Heaven.	 They	 deal	 with	 the	 unfolding	 of	 the	 individual	 factor	 in	 a	 spiritual	 or
archetypal	way,	in	relation	to	thinking	and	to	the	flow	of	the	power	of	the	being.
But	 there	 are	 much	 more	 complex	 types	 of	 directions,	 which	 take	 into
consideration	the	actual	motions	of	the	planets,	their	declination,	and	above	all,
the	factor	of	latitude	of	the	birth-place.	Latitude	is	a	factor	which	relates	to	the
horizon	 and	 to	 the	 Ascendant—because	 the	 latitude	 of	 the	 birth-place	 must	 be
known	in	order	to	determine	the	degree	of	the	Ascendant.	Thus	we	have	a	type
of	primary	directions	which	carry,	symbolically,	the	general	significance	of	the
Ascendant.	 They	 deal	 with	 the	 unfolding	 of	 the	 individual	 factor	 in	 a	 personal
and	 most	 particular	 way.	 They	 reveal	 the	 uniqueness	 of	 individual	 destiny,	 the
unique	inner	realization	of	the	individual’s	own	essence.

In	such	a	system	of	“mundane”	directions,	changes	of	residence	have	also	to
be	 taken	 in	 consideration;	 for	 here	 is	 seen	 the	 most	 particular	 interweaving	 of
individual	with	planetary	factors:	man’s	close	relationship	to	the	Earth,	either	in
a	trivial	and	environmental	sense,	or	in	terms	of	spiritual	contact	with	the	great
Nature-forces	of	the	planet.

### Radix	Directions

In	order	to	make	the	first	type	of	primary	directions	simpler	and	more	easily
determinable	 with	 the	 use	 of	 the	 ordinary	 astrological	 ephemeris,	 a	 system	 of
directions	has	been	devised	(by	Sepharial	and	later	by	Vivian	Robson)	which	is
called	 the	 “Radix	 System.’	 In	 this	 system	 the	 “arcs	 of	 directions”	 between
planets	are	calculated	on	the	ecliptic	(that	is,	in	terms	of	longitude)	rather	than
on	 the	 equator	 (that	 is,	 in	 terms	 of	 Right	 Ascension).	 If	 at	 birth	 the	 Sun	 is	 in
Aries	10	and	Venus	in	Aries	29,	the	arc	of	direction	between	these	planets	is	19°.
According	to	Sepharial,	and	according	to	most	astrologers	using	this	simplest
of	all	systems,	a	year	of	life	is	not	calculated	as	corresponding	to	one	degree,	but
to	 59’	 8”—which	 is	 the	 mean	 daily	 motion	 of	 the	 Sun	 (the	 result	 of	 dividing

365%	solar	days	into	360	degrees).	In	such	a	system	all	points	of	the	birth-chart,
planets	and	cusps,	are	moved	at	this	rate	of	59’	8”	per	year;	and	the	relationship
between	 these	 successive	 positions	 (yearly	 and	 monthly)	 and	 the	 radical
positions	is	analyzed	in	terms	of	aspects.

This	rate	of	direction	is	not	the	only	one	considered.	Just	as	the	mean	daily
motion	of	the	Sun	provides	the	astrologer	with	a	coefficient	of	direction,	so	the
mean	daily	motion	of	the	Moon	(13°	10’)	is	used	for	the	same	purpose,	a	year	of
the	life	corresponding	to	a	directional	advance	of	13°	1°’.	This	last	procedure	is
called	 “minor	 directions,”	 while	 the	 former	 carries	 the	 name	 of	 “major
directions,”	 the	 minor	 being	 always	 subservient	 to	 the	 major,	 which	 give	 the
most	basic	informations.

Thus,	if	we	consider	the	birth-chart	distance	between	Sun	and	Venus	(19°),
we	shall	see	that	such	an	arc	can	be	interpreted	as	bringing	about	a	Sun-Venus
conjunction	primarily	at	the	age	of	19%	(major	directions),	and	also	secondarily
at	the	ages	of	18	months,	28	years	and	two	months,	56	years	and	one	month,	83
years	 and	 five	 months	 (minor	 directions).	 A	 table	 of	 exact	 equivalence	 of	 arcs
and	 periods	 is	 given	 at	 the	 end	 of	 Vivian	 Robson’s	 book,	 The	 Radix	 System,
which	details	the	technique	of	such	directions.

Such	 a	 system	 is	 outwardly	 very	 close	 to	 the	 time-analysis	 method
previously	studied;	but	the	use	of	the	solar	and	lunar	mean	daily	motions	gives	it
a	flavor	of	“secondary	progressions.”	There	seems	in	fact	very	little	reason	for
adopting	 such	 coefficients	 of	 translation	 of	 spatial	 into	 durational	 values,	 for
either	 the	 actual	 daily	 motion	 of	 Sun	 and	 Moon	 should	 be	 considered,	 or	 the
archetypal	 value	 of	 one	 degree.	 The	 Radix	 System	 is	 obviously	 a	 compromise
aiming	 at	 ease	 of	 calculation	 and	 simplification.	 But	 once	 the	 principle	 of	 the
time-analysis	of	the	birth-chart	is	fully	understood,	it	seems	a	much	more	valid
foundation	for	getting	at	the	basic	phases	of	operation	of	the	essential	destiny	of
the	individual.

### Transits

According	 to	 the	 concepts	 formulated	 in	 our	 last	 chapter,	 transits	 do	 not
differ	 fundamentally	 from	 progressions	 or	 directions.	 They	 are	 constituted	 by
planetary	 motion	 along	 the	 370-year	 cycle	 of	 personality-fulfillment.	 In	 such
motion,	 a	day	of	 progression	corresponds	to	a	day	of	the	life,	a	year	to	a	year.
For	 the	 rest,	 they	 have	 to	 be	 treated	 exactly	 like	 secondary	 progressions.	 The
aspects	 may	 be	 calculated	 “progressed-to-progressed”	 or	 “progressed-to-
radical.”	“Progressed”	here	means	the	actual	positions	of	the	planets	as	seen	in

the	 ephemeris	 for	 the	 year	 of	 the	 life	 considered.	 The	 point	 to	 remember	 is
always	 that	 such	 positions	 and	 the	 aspects	 formed	 refer	 to	 the	 realm	 of
personality;	 that	 is,	 to	 that	 manifested	 synthesis	 of	 behavior,	 feelings	 and
thoughts	 which	 is	 the	 “concrete	 man,”	 the	 man	 attempting	 to	 actualize	 and	 to
demonstrate	in	an	earth-organism	(physiological	and	psychological)	the	totality
of	his	being.

An	 illustration	 will	 elucidate	 completely	 this	 point.	 Let	 us	 take	 again
Mussolini’s	chart.	He	was	born	July	29,	1883.	Now	let	us	consider	the	conditions
of	“transits”	for	the	time	of	the	“march	on	Rome”;	that	is,	39	years	and	3	months
after	 his	 birth:	 October	 30,	 1922.	 We	 look	 in	 the	 ephemeris	 for	 that	 date	 and
mark	down	the	positions	of	the	planets	(by	longitude).	These	 positions	give	us
the	“transiting	positions”	of	the	planets.

If,	on	the	other	hand,	we	had	desired	the	“progressed	positions”	for	that	same
date,	we	should	have	had	to	look	in	the	ephemeris	for	September	6,	1883	(that	is,
39	days	and	6	hours	after	birth).	And	if	we	had	searched	by	“primary	directions”
for	the	positions	for	this	“march	on	Rome,”	we	should	have	had	to	consider	the
state	 of	 the	 Earth’s	 rotation	 157	 minutes	 (that	 is,	 39	 times	 4	 minutes,	 plus	 1
minute)	after	the	exact	moment	of	Mussolini’s	first	breath.	The	same	process	is
used	in	all	three	cases,	save	that	in	the	case	of	“primary	directions”	the	factors
considered	 are	 of	 a	 somewhat	 different	 nature,	 and	 thus	 their	 consideration
requires	more	involved	calculations.

Coming	back	now	to	the	“transiting	positions”	for	the	“march	on	Rome,”	we
find	 that,	 just	 as	 in	 the	 interpretation	 of	 secondary	 progressions,	 there	 are	 two
methods	 possible.	 The	 first	 method	 is	 to	 study	 the	 “transiting-to-transiting”
aspects;	the	second,	to	analyze	the	aspects	formed	between	transiting	and	radical
positions.	The	first	method	refers	obviously	to	the	most	transitory	factors	of	the
situation,	 to	 the	 pure	 flux	 of	 circumstances,	 having	 no	 particular	 reference	 to
Mussolini	 as	 an	 individual,	 but	 characterizing	 the	 condition	 of	 the	 general
feelings	and	dispositions	of	everything	on	the	surface	of	the	Earth	that	day.

Now	 we	 find	 that	 on	 October	 30,	 1922,	 the	 Moon	 was	 in	 conjunction	 with
Uranus,	just	before	noon,	in	the	10th	degree	of	Pisces;	that	Neptune	in	Leo	was
in	 sextile	 to	 Mercury	 and	 Saturn	 in	 Libra;	 Jupiter	 in	 distant	 conjunction	 to	 the
Sun	 in	 Scorpio;	 Mars	 in	 trine	 to	 the	 North	 Node	 and	 in	 approaching	 square	 to
Jupiter.	 On	 the	 whole,	 the	 set-up	 was	 a	 most	 favorable	 one	 for	 public
regeneration	and	the	display	of	power.	The	Sun’s	symbol	that	day	was	“Divers	of
the	deep	sea,”	indicating	a	fearless	plunging	into	experience,	or,	as	Marc	Jones

interprets	it,	“of	purposeful	venturing.”	The	Moon-Uranus	conjunction	occurred
on	 a	 degree	 symbolized	 by	 “An	 aviator	 in	 high	 altitude	 flight,	 master	 of	 the
skies,”	which	is	interpreted	as	indicating	“the	transcendence	of	normal	problems
to	the	point	of	gaining	celestial	responsibilities”	and	the	“coronation”	of	human
endeavors.	All	of	which	is	most	significant	indeed!

But	 it	 does	 not	 refer	 to	 Mussolini	 as	 an	 individual,	 only	 to	 the	 quality	 of
world-happenings	 on	 that	 day.	 In	 order	 to	 see	 how	 these	 “planetary	 positions”
refer	 to	 Mussolini	 as	 an	 individual,	 we	 have	 to	 compare	 them	 with	 his	 radical
birth-chart,	 the	 seed-form	 of	 his	 destiny.	 One	 feature	 emerges	 at	 once,	 vividly:
The	 “transiting	 Sun”	 was	 in	 exact	 conjunction	 with	 Mussolini’s	 North	 Node	 at
the	very	end	of	the	day.	At	the	end	of	the	day	he	reached	Rome,	summoned	by
the	King	to	assume	full	power.	In	other	words,	as	the	North	Node	is	a	point	of
future	destiny	and	influx	of	power,	October	30	was	the	one	day	of	the	year	when,
the	“transiting	Sun”	vitalizing	it,	it	would	operate	with	a	maximum	of	power—in
reference	 to	 Mussolini’s	 personality.	 Obviously,	 in	 such	 an	 event	 what	 was
involved	more	than	anything	else	was	the	power	of	personality.

At	 the	 same	 time	 the	 Moon-Uranus	 transiting	 conjunction	 occurred	 in
Mussolini’s	“fourth	house”—a	change	of	domicile	and	of	concrete	selfhood—in
opposition	to	his	radical	Part	of	Fortune—	an	awareness	(opposition)	of	public
responsibility	(tenth	house);	in	a	sense,	opposing	his	personal	happiness	(Part	of
Fortune).	 This	 conjunction	 was	 square	 to	 his	 radical	 Saturn-Moon-Mars
conjunction,	 striking	 squarely	 the	 Moon	 and	 indicating	 the	 incorporation
(square)	 of	 a	 public	 (Moon)	 destiny.	 Transiting	 Neptune	 was	 very	 close	 to	 the
Mid-Heaven	in	Leo,	showing	that	the	power	of	the	racial	collectivity	was	being
focused	 upon	 Mussolini’s	 point	 of	 public	 activity	 and	 spiritual	 power.	 Finally,
the	transiting	North	Node	was	upon	the	cusp	of	his	“eleventh	house,”	about	to
enter	by	natural	retrogression	his	house	of	public	activity—indicating	the	power
of	 friends	 and	 associates	 in	 a	 common	 cause.	 We	 might	 further	 add	 that
transiting	Mercury	and	Saturn	were	in	his	“third	house,”	close	to	an	opposition
to	his	radical	Jupiter	and	Venus.	This	was	a	most	valuable	restraining	influence,
bringing	 common	 sense,	 moderation,	 and	 attention	 to	 near	 objectives	 (third
house)	—as	balanced	against	far	and	grandiose	plans	(ninth	house).	Mussolini’s
Jupiter-Venus	conjunction	in	the	“ninth	house”	is	a	danger	for	him;	and	this	may
be	particularly	evident	in	the	near	future,	as	his	“progressed	Mars”	is	adding	fuel
to	an	over-expansive	and	imperialistic	configuration.

This	reference	to	a	progressed	planet	leads	us	to	state	that	at	the	time	of	this
march	on	Rome,	Mussolini’s	“progressed	Moon”	was	approximately	crossing	his

radical	 Ascendant—the	 strongest	 indication	 for	 a	 significant	 change	 of
surroundings	and	an	equally	important	repolarization	of	the	outer	personal	life.
The	most	important	aspect	by	“primary	direction”	is	the	conjunction	of	Mars	to
Jupiter,	which	shows	expansion—this	time	in	reference	to	the	individual	factor.
Thus	 an	 increase	 of	 individual	 assurance	 and	 authority,	 a	 mobilization	 of	 soul-
energies	for	expansive	action.

To	 study	 in	 detail	 all	 the	 complex	 set-up	 of	 progressions,	 directions	 and
transits	for	this	most	significant	event	in	Mussolini’s	life	is	far	beyond	the	scope
of	this	book;	but	we	trust	enough	has	been	said	to	indicate	the	general	procedure
and	to	show	how	these	three	basic	methods	can	be	operated	in	relation	to	each
other.

Transits	can	be	worked	out	in	many	ways,	but	a	few	points	must	always	be
considered	when	transiting	planets	are	referred	to	the	birth-chart.	First	of	all,	fast
moving	 planets	 such	 as	 Mercury,	 Mars	 and	 Venus,	 make	 so	 many	 and	 such
frequent	aspects	to	the	radical	planets	that	the	importance	of	these	aspects	is	very
slight.	In	such	cases	the	passage	of	a	transiting	planet	through	a	radical	house	is
usually	 the	 most	 valuable	 factor	 of	 determination;	 especially	 as	 any	 transiting
planet	crosses	the	“angles”	of	the	radical	chart,	thus	enhancing	temporarily	in	the
personality-life	 the	 function	 symbolized	 by	 each	 of	 the	 angles,	 in	 terms	 of	 the
type	of	activity	represented	by	the	planet.

The	patterns	made	by	the	slow	moving	planets	(Uranus,	Neptune	and	Pluto)
are,	however,	of	great	importance,	for	through	the	aspects	these	transiting	planets
make	 to	 the	 radical	 planets	 (and	 through	 their	 passage	 through	 the	 radical
houses)	the	influence	of	human	collectivities,	and	of	society	in	general,	upon	the
development	of	personality	can	be	accurately	charted.	Transits	of	Uranus	release
the	individual’s	genius	(or	“madness”)	and	make	it	socially	effective.	Transits	of
Neptune	refer,	on	the	contrary,	to	the	pressure	of	collective	or	group	factors	upon
the	 individual	 fighting	 for	 his	 right	 to	 be	 an	 individual.	 Transits	 of	 Pluto	 bring
out	 (when	 effective)	 the	 call	 of	 a	 new	 order	 to	 the	 personality.	 They	 force	 the
personality	 into	 alignment	 with	 new	 ideals	 and	 new	 social	 forms.	 They	 may
cause	 destiny-affecting	 deaths	 in	 the	 sphere	 of	 the	 personality;	 also	 destiny-
affecting	partnerships.

The	 transits	 of	 Jupiter	 and	 Saturn	 refer	 more	 especially	 to	 the	 manner	 in
which	 man’s	 ego	 functions	 outwardly;	 to	 inhibitive	 and	 formative	 phases	 of
development	in	the	case	of	Saturn;	to	expansive	and	compensatory	types	of	soul-
release	in	the	case	of	Jupiter.	Saturn’s	29-year	cycle	and	Jupiter’s	12-year	cycle

are	important	factors	in	the	life-process,	especially	with	regard	to	what	might	be
called	the	“soul	factor.”

The	influence	of	transiting	planets	is	much	emphasized	when	a	conjunction
or	 opposition	 of	 such	 planets	 strikes	 an	 important	 point	 of	 the	 radical	 chart.
Thus,	 every	 lunation	 (conjunction—	 and	 opposition—of	 Sun	 and	 Moon)	 has
significance	 for	 the	 personality	 if	 it	 occurs	 in	 strong	 aspect	 to	 a	 strong	 radical
planet	 (or	 angles).	 This	 significance	 is	 much	 enhanced	 in	 the	 case	 of	 eclipses.
For	instance,	the	eclipse	of	July	29,	1935,*	on	Mussolini’s	Sun	may	prove	to	be
of	quite	a	striking	significance.	A	massing	of	planets	transiting	a	strong	radical
point	is,	of	course,	of	still	greater	importance.

Another	and	most	valuable	way	of	using	transits	is	found	in	the	erection	of	a
birth-day	chart.	Such	a	chart	is	made	for	every	birthday,	and	shows	in	a	usually
most	accurate	way	the	type	of	personality-occurrences	to	be	expected	during	that
particular	 year	 of	 the	 native’s	 life	 (i.e.,	 from	 birthday	 to	 birthday).	 But	 here
again,	there	are	at	least	two	basic	methods	of	erecting	such	a	chart:

1)	The	birth-day	chart	is	calculated	for	the	original	time	of	birth	at	the	place

of	residence	(not	the	place	of	birth).

2)	The	birth-day	chart	is	calculated	for	the	moment	at	which	the	“transiting
Sun”	returns	to	the	exact	zodiacal	position	it	occupied	at	birth.	This
moment	may	not	fall	on	the	same	day	as	the	day	of	birth.	Therefore	such
a	chart	is	called,	instead	of	“birth-day	chart,”	a	“solar	revolution	chart.”	It
may	be	erected	either	for	the	latitude	of	the	place	of	birth	or	for	that	of
the	place	of	residence.	The	former	is	preferable;	for	this	type	of	chart	is
definitely	correlated	to	the	birth-chart	through	identity	of	solar	factors	—
thus	to	the	latitude	of	birth	as	well.

In	both	of	these	cases	the	pattern	of	houses	is	usually	different	from	that	of	the
birth-chart,	unless,	in	case	No.	1,	the	native	resides	at	his	place	of	birth.	If	one
wishes	 to	 retain	 the	 birth-pattern	 of	 houses,	 then	 the	 birth-day	 chart	 must	 be
calculated	 for	 the	 place	 of	 birth;	 in	 other	 words,	 the	 transiting	 positions	 of	 the
planets	are	marked	within	the	radical	frame-work	of	houses.	This	is	the	general
way	in	which	transits	are	calculated.

Thus	we	have	seen	briefly	how	the	various	types	of	progressions,	directions
and	 transits	 operate.	 If	 we	 are	 careful	 to	 constantly	 keep	 in	 view	 the	 whole
picture	 which	 such	 systems	 make,	 and	 if	 we	 have	 thoroughly	 grasped	 the

psychological	division	of	the	whole	human	being	into	individual,	collective	and
personality	 factors,	 we	 should	 have	 no	 difficulty	 in	 getting	 hold	 of	 a	 complex
situation.	 The	 main	 point	 we	 wish	 to	 emphasize—and	 we	 believe	 it	 has	 never
been	 so	 emphasized	 before—is	 that	 there	 is	 no	 basic	 difference	 between
progressions,	 directions	 and	 transits.	 In	 these	 three	 systems	 we	 establish	 a
correspondence	between	units	of	three	cycles:	the	day-cycle	(individual	factor),
the	year-cycle	(collective	factor),	and	the	370-year	cycle	(personality	factor);	and
we	read	the	actual	state	of	the	heavens	after	birth	in	terms	of	such	cyclic	units,
equating	them	in	any	way	we	wish.

Such	readings	of	post-natal	positions	are	in	most	cases	to	be	referred	to	the
birth-chart,	 because	 the	 latter	 represents	 the	 seed-form	 of	 being;	 and	 because
“becoming”	 cannot	 have	 significance	save	 in	 terms	 of	 “being.”	 Pure	 values	 of
“becoming”	 may	 be	 ascertained	 usefully	 in	 many	 cases,	 as	 in	 “progressed-to-
progressed”	 and	 “transiting-to-transiting”	 planetary	 aspects.	 But	 one	 obtains
thereby	 information	 relating,	 in	 the	 case	 of	 progressions	 only,	 to	 the	 flux	 of
“personality-becoming,”	and	in	the	case	of	transits	only,	to	the	condition	of	the
general	 environment.	 As	 our	 main	 preoccupation	 is	 with	 the	 process	 following
which	the	individual,	after	successive	assimilation	of	collective	values,	reaches
fulfillment	as	a	creative	personality,	it	is	evident	that	we	can	bring	significance
into	this	process	only	by	referring	all	factors	of	“becoming”	to	the	seed-form	of
individual	“being.”

The	great	difficulty	in	working	with	several	systems	of	time-computation	is
that	 the	 time	 of	 maturation	 of	 the	 same	 aspect	 is	 different	 in	 each	 system.	 If,
therefore,	 prognostications	 of	 events	 are	 attempted,	 it	 is	 very	 hard	 indeed	 to
know	which	time-indication	to	select	for	the	event.	Sometimes,	by	analyzing	the
basic	import	of	the	type	of	event	considered,	one	can	know	whether	it	is	more
likely	to	fall	in	with	the	indications	given	by	the	individual-factor	system	or	by
the	collective-factor	system,	etc.	But	this	is	always	an	uncertain	matter.

The	 point	 is	 that	 no	 event	 can	 accurately	 be	 foretold	 by	 natal	 astrology.
Psychic	 types	 of	 fortune-telling,	 and	 to	 a	 very	 considerable	 extent	 “horary
astrology,”	can	in	a	way	produce	better	evidences	of	forecasting	accuracy.	They
locate	events	better	perhaps;	but	they	cannot	give	significance	to	the	life-process
of	 which	 these	 events	 are	 mere	 outside	 pointers.	 Here	 again	 we	 find	 a
psychological	 type	 of	 “principle	 of	 indeterminacy”	 at	 work.	 No	 one	 can
normally	 give	 accurately	 the	 location	 of	 an	 event	 and	 the	 significance	 of	 that
event	at	the	same	time.	Each	factor	requires	a	special	type	of	mental	or	spiritual
polarization	which,	at	least	to	some	extent,	excludes	the	other.

Besides,	 why	 should	 events	 be	 foretold	 accurately?	 The	 coefficient	 of
inaccuracy	is	the	coefficient	of	freedom.	From	a	strict	astrological	viewpoint,	the
latter	is	seen	to	consist	in	the	very	fact	that	there	are	 various	possible	ways	of
progressing,	directing	or	“transiting”	a	chart.	This	fact	refers	to	the	basic	three-
fold	constitution	of	man:	the	mental	principle	(individual),	the	feeling	principle
(collective)	 and	 the	 behavior	 principle	 (personality).	 Thoughts,	 feelings,	 and
actions	 have	 each	 a	 quasi-independent	 existence	 in	 man—as	 occult	 philosophy
has	 shown	 since	 or	 before	 Plato.	 Freedom	 resides	 in	 the	 creative	 interplay	 of
these	three	factors.

Thus	 the	 creative	 factor	 in	 progressions	 and	 the	 like	 is	 the	 very	 element	 of
inaccuracy—the	despair	of	astrologers!	Freedom,	as	we	already	saw	in	relation
to	 our	 analysis	 of	 “cusps”	 (Cf.	 p.	 311),	 is	 the	 “in	 neutral”	 element	 in	 life.
Between	 the	 archetypal	 plane	 and	 the	 realm	 of	 actual	 behavior	 there	 is	 a
mysteriously	elusive	world,	which	is	the	world	of	the	human	psyche	(the	much
misunderstood	kama-manasic	realm	of	Theosophists—the	Sukshma	realm	of	the
Hindu	 philosopher).	 It	 is	 the	 world	 of	 freedom	 and	 of	 illusion;	 the	 world	 of
creativeness	and	of	deceit;	the	world	where	archetypal	realities	are	seen	not	as
they	 are,	 but	 blurred	 by	 the	 motion	 of	 becoming—just	 as	 a	 landscape	 is	 seen
blurred	through	the	closed	windows	of	a	fast	moving	train,	especially	if	motion
makes	the	traveler	train-sick!	It	is	the	world	of	personality,	the	world	of	relativity
—from	 which	 the	 Hindu	 philosopher	 is	 so	 eager	 to	 become	 disentangled.	 But
what	is	disentanglement?	To	us,	it	is	a	mere	fallacy,	unless	it	means	first	of	all
fulfillment	Freedom	is	won	only	through	fulfillment	And	to	be	free	means	always
somewhat	 not	 to	 know;	 it	 is	 the	 coefficient	 of	 inaccuracy.	 It	 is	 based	 on	 the
courage	to	go	forth	while	not	knowing	the	future.

That	 is	 why	 spiritual	 teachers	 or	 “Masters’—whatever	 they	 be	 —never
compel,	 never	 show	 the	 exact	 future	 of	 any	 action	 undertaken.	 For	 to	 do	 so
would	 be	 to	 rob	 man	 of	 his	 creative	 freedom	 and	 his	 creative	 initiative.	 What
man	can	do	is	so	to	understand	the	past,	so	to	grasp	the	full	significance	of	the
seed-form	of	his	being	and	destiny	(birth-chart),	that	he	is	fully	prepared	to	meet
any	future—to	meet	it	significantly,	with	courage,	with	understanding	and	from
such	 a	 “formed”	 view-point	 that	 all	 events	 are	 seen	 as	 beautiful.	 This	 is	 the
creative	and	the	radiant	life	of	fulfillment.

### Rectification	of	the	Birth-chart

We	 cannot	 close	 this	 chapter	 without	 mentioning,	 in	 the	 briefest	 possible
manner,	 a	 matter	 of	 supreme	 importance,	 one	 which	 is	 really	 the	 most

aggravating	 factor	 in	 any	 practical	 astrological	 work.	 This	 factor	 is	 the	 almost
universal	uncertainty	as	to	the	exact	moment	at	which	a	person	breathed	his	or
her	 first	 breath.	 If	 the	 reader	 has	 followed	 us	 understandingly	 through	 our
presentation	of	the	fundamentals	of	astrology,	it	will	 be	evident	to	him	that	all
the	 factors	 in	 a	 birth-chart	 which	 refer	 to	 the	 axial	 rotation	 of	 the	 Earth	 are
absolutely	dependent	upon	the	strictly	exact	moment	of	birth	(first	breath).	For	a
difference	of	four	minutes	in	birth-time	changes	the	degrees	of	all	cusps,	of	all
astrological	 Parts,	 and	 therefore	 alters	 all	 calculations	 based	 on	 primary
directions.

This	means,	of	course,	that	where	there	is	such	an	uncertainty	of	birth-time
there	 must	 in	 the	 same	 proportion	 be	 an	 incertitude	 concerning	 the	 individual
factors	within	the	native’s	personality	and	destiny.	This	is	of	capital	importance
for	any	type	of	interpretation	in	which	the	symbolic	factor	of	degrees	is	stressed,
and	 in	 general	 for	 any	 type	 of	 psychological	 and	 creative	 interpretation.	 As	 an
error	 of	 four	 minutes	 in	 birth-time	 is	 almost	 unavoidable,	 considering	 the
haphazard	 manner	 in	 which	 birth-time	 is	 recorded	 by	 attending	 nurses,	 and
considering	 the	 variable	 memory	 of	 the	 mother	 and	 relatives—the	 problem	 is
indeed	 a	 most	 serious	 one.	 It	 actually	 tends	 to	 make	 the	 vast	 majority	 of
astrological	 interpretations	 quite	 unreliable	 in	 many	 ways,	 especially	 when	 the
inner	nature	and	the	spiritual-creative	factors	in	the	process	of	individuation	are
analyzed.

To	obviate	such	a	handicap,	the	astrologer	has	recourse	to	a	procedure	called
“rectification.”	It	is	an	attempt	at	discovering,	by	one	of	several	methods	in	use,
what	 the	 exact	 birth-moment	 was.	 The	 various	 bases	 of	 these	 methods	 of
rectification	can	be	generally	stated	as	follows:

1)	Tracing	the	rising	sign	by	the	native’s	features.	This	is	based	on	the	fact
that	 the	 Ascendant	 refers	 to	 the	 structure	 of	 individual	 being—or	 rather	 to	 the
features	 thereof.	 Structure,	 in	 the	 sense	 of	 the	 bone-structure,	 is	 a	 matter
depending	more	upon	Saturn	and	the	Moon.	But	“features”	refer	not	only	to	the
general	body-structure,	but	even	more	to	the	general	expression	of	the	body,	and
especially	 of	 the	 face.	 The	 Sun-sign	 gives	 more	 the	 vital	 radiation	 of	 the
personality	 as	 a	 whole;	 Saturn	 and	 the	 Moon,	 the	 frame	 of	 the	 body	 and	 the
rhythm	 of	 the	 life	 of	 feelings,	 which	 is	 largely	 conditioned	 by	 this	 body-
framework.	 The	 Ascendant	 refers	 to	 the	 individual’s	 expression	 through	 the
body,	to	the	unique	factor	of	being,	to	the	manner	in	which	the	individual	lives
his	life	in	a	material	structure.	That	is	why	the	Ascendant-type	becomes	usually
more	 evident	 after	 the	 age	 of	 35;	 for	 then	 the	 individual	 as	 such	 has	 become

more	fully	“in-corporated,”	and	his	mark	or	signature	more	clearly	visible.

Twelve	basic	Ascendant-types	of	features	being	determined,	the	astrologer	is
then	able,	by	looking	at	the	native,	to	determine	his	“rising	sign”—theoretically!
Practically	speaking,	such	a	determination	is	always	more	or	less	uncertain,	as	it
is	 difficult	 to	 separate	 the	 Ascendant-factor	 from	 other	 factors	 which	 influence
the	bodily	appearance.	Moreover,	this	method	determines	only	the	nature	of	the
sign	 rising—which,	 as	 an	 average,	 means	 a	 two-hour	 period	 during	 which	 the
person	may	have	been	born.	This	is,	however,	a	very	valuable	procedure,	always
to	be	used	when	the	person	does	not	know	even	the	hour	of	his	or	her	birth.

2)	Rectifying	by	past	events.	 The	principle	of	this	procedure	is	that,	as	it	is
possible	to	foretell	future	events	from	an	accurately	known	birth-moment,	so	it	is
possible	 to	 deduce	 the	 exact	 birth-moment	 from	 accurately	 known	 past	 events.
This	 is,	 properly	 speaking,	 “rectifying”	 a	 doubtful	 birth-time	 from	 the
knowledge	 of	 the	 native’s	 life-history.	 Obviously,	 the	 procedure	 is	 a	 most
hazardous	 one	 except	 when	 the	 incertitude	 as	 to	 the	 birth-moment	 is	 confined
within	narrow	time-limits—say,	fifteen	minutes	or	half	an	hour.	Nevertheless,	it
is	 much	 easier	 to	 find	 the	 correct	 astrological	 aspect	 that	 is	 an	 expression	 of	 a
certain	life-event	than	to	predict	a	precise	event	as	a	result	of	a	coming	aspect.
This,	 because	 past	 destiny	 is	 crystallized	 life—life	 minus	 the	 uncertainty	 of
human	freedom.

To	put	it	differently:	No	event	occurs	in	a	life	to	which	an	astrological	aspect
cannot	be	symbolically	related,	giving	to	that	event	an	adequate	meaning.	But	it
does	not	follow	that	a	definite	aspect	will	always	produce	a	definite	occurrence.
An	 aspect	 is	 necessary	 for	 an	 event	 to	 take	 place,	 but	 it	 is	 not	 sufficient
testimony	for	foretelling	accurately	the	coming	of	a	definite	event.	An	important
point	which	one	should	never	forget!

The	 difficulty	 is	 to	 isolate	 the	 particular	 past	 occurrence	 which	 is	 truly
corresponding	to,	or	signified	by,	a	particular	aspect	that	matured	at	a	particular
time.	 An	 aspect	 by	 secondary	 progression	 and	 an	 aspect	 by	 primary	 direction
may	appear	to	refer,	let	us	say,	to	an	important	journey;	yet	they	figure	to	dates	a
year	or	two	apart.	The	problem	of	rectification	is:	Which	aspect	is	the	one	from
which	 to	 figure	 back	 to	 the	 unknown	 birth-moment?	 Two	 or	 more	 aspects	 by
secondary	progressions	may	also	be	taken,	indifferently,	it	may	seem,	to	signify
one	definite	event.	If	calculations	are	made	backward	from	those	several	aspects,
several	putative	birth-moments	may	be	found.

Thus	 rectification	 involves	 a	 very	 complex	 series	 of	 checks	 and	 counter-

### time	 on

### it	 and	 much

checks,	of	figuring	backward	and	forward,	which	means	—even	when	the	life	of
the	 native	 presents	 sharp	 turning	 points	 (the	 best	 case	 for	 the	 purpose	 of
rectification)—spending	 much
ingenuity.	 A	 real
psychological	grasp	of	human	life	and	human	reactions	is	absolutely	necessary	if
the	 astrologer	 is	 to	 determine	 which	 aspect	 is	 the	 most	 likely	 symbol	 of	 some
past	event;	also	the	ability	to	elicit	from	the	native	information	which	he	himself
may	 have	 forgotten,	 or	 the	 importance	 of	 which	 he	 does	 not	 realize.	 Such	 an
ability	 is	 not	 as	 frequent	 as	 might	 seem,	 and	 every	 psychoanalyst	 will	 be	 well
aware	of	this	fact.	Very	few	persons,	indeed,	realize	which	events	of	their	past
have	really	been	significant;	neither	do	people	usually	grasp	the	true	significance
of	these	events.	The	greatest	value	of	astrology	is	probably	to	be	found	in	the	aid
it	gives	man	in	discovering	the	significance	of	what	has	already	happened.	Only
as	every	factor	of	his	life-history	stands	out	with	clear	meaning	in	terms	of	the
whole	 life-destiny—only	 then	 is	 man	 really	 prepared	 to	 face	 his	 future	 with
intelligence	and	understanding;	in	other	words,	in	function	of	his	true	individual
selfhood.

After	considering	most	of	the	important	astrological	factors	mentioned	as	the
most	 telling	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 rectification,	 we	 believe	 that	 those	 which	 Marc
Jones	mentions	in	his	course	Directional	Astrology	are	probably	the	best;	at	any
rate,	they	are	by	far	the	simplest.	These	are:

1)	The	passage	of	the	progressed	Moon	over	the	angles	of	the	birth-chart—
which	 enables	 one	 to	 compute	 these	 angles	 accurately.	 The	 passage	 over	 the
Ascendant	is	in	almost	every	case	an	index	to	some	basic	change	in	destiny	or	in
self-realization.	 It	 usually	 marks	 a	 significant	 change	 of	 residence	 or
environment;	in	many	cases,	however,	a	change	of	“interior	environment,”	a	new
approach	to	self-realization,	are	the	only	things	traceable	in	the	life—	especially
in	the	case	of	typical	introverts.

2)	The	aspects	of	Mars	or	Saturn	to	the	zenith	meridian,	i.e.,	to	Mid-Heaven
or	the	Nadir	point,	which	often	refers	to	the	death	of	the	parents.	Such	aspects
can	be	calculated	according	to	the	simplest	type	of	primary	directions;	but	from
our	 standpoint,	 what	 they	 refer	 to	 is	 what	 we	 called	 the	 time-analysis	 of	 the
birth-chart.	 The	 death	 of	 a	 parent—especially	 the	 first	 death—marks	 a	 definite
psychological	liberation	of	the	individual	factor	in	almost	every	life.	It	is	such	a
basic	occurrence	that	it	should	be	noticed	in	the	very	seed-form	of	destiny,	in	the
blue-prints	 of	 the	 individual	 structure	 of	 being.	 Such	 a	 death	 is	 normally
accompanied	by	a	release	of	psychic	or	soul	forces	from	the	deceased	parent	into
the	 native;	 and	 the	 significance	 thereof	 is	 usually	 paramount.	 There	 are	 cases,

however,	 in	 which	 the	 clear-cut	 estrangement	 of	 the	 native	 from	 the	 parents
amounts	to	a	“psychological	death”	of	the	parents;	and	it	is	to	this	event	that	the
above-mentioned	aspect	refers,	rather	than	to	actual	physical	death.

The	death-aspects	to	be	considered	are	conjunction,	square	and	semi-square
of	 either	 Mars	 or	 Saturn	 to	 Mid-Heaven	 or	 Nadir	 point.	 If	 Mars	 is	 ten	 degrees
apart	 from	 the	 Mid-Heaven,	 the	 death	 of	 a	 parent	 may	 occur	 at	 the	 age	 of	 ten.
But	 it	 may	 also	 occur	 at	 the	 age	 of	 35	 (by	 semi-square	 aspect).	 Again,	 such
aspects	do	not	indicate	the	necessity	of	a	death;	but	if	a	death	did	happen	at	the
age	of	10,	and	Mars	is	shown	to	be	11	degrees	away	from	the	Mid-Heaven,	then
the	logical	conclusion	is	that	the	position	of	the	Mid-Heaven	is	not	correct,	and
should	 be	 moved	 one	 degree	 so	 as	 to	 make	 the	 arc	 between	 Mars	 and	 Mid-
Heaven	equal	10	degrees.	This	is	what	is	meant	by	“rectifying”	a	chart.

3)	Rectifying	through	the	prenatal	epoch,	or	by	the	mother’s	birthday	are	two
methods	of	unequal	importance	and	widely	differing	in	technique.	They	are	put
in	 one	 category	 because	 both	 are	 attempts	 to	 define	 the	 emergence	 of	 the
individual	 factor	 in	 a	 new	 life-cycle	 (first	 breath)	 in	 function	 of	 its	 maternal
ancestry.	 The	 idea	 is	 that	 certain	 periods	 affecting	 the	 formation	 of	 the	 bodily
substance	 of	 the	 being	 through	 the	 mother	 led	 in	 a	 measurable	 way	 to	 the
beginning	of	the	period	of	individual	existence.

Much	 has	 been	 said	 for	 and	 against	 making	 a	 chart	 for	 the	 time	 of
conception.	 We	 may	 merely	 point	 out	 that	 conception	 is	 a	 moment	 in	 the
mother’s	life	and	not	in	the	life	of	an	individual	person	who	can	in	no	way	be
called	 an	 individual	 until	 he	 has	 acted	 as	 an	 independent	 and	 relatively	 self-
sustained	 entity:	 viz.,	 until	 he	 has	 breathed.	 Conception	 in	 a	 sense	 is	 no	 more
important	for	the	life	of	the	future	individual	child	than	the	time	when	his	future
mother	 and	 father	 met.	 It	 pertains	 to	 the	 cycle	 antedating	 his	 own	 individual
cycle.	It	is	the	last	of	a	series	of	events,	stretching	as	far	back	as	the	beginning	of
the	solar	system,	which	conditions	that	out	 of	which	the	 individual	emerges.	It
sums	 up	 heredity.	 But	 heredity	 is	 merely	 one	 of	 the	 basic	 aspects	 of	 the
collective	 factor	 of	 being;	 the	 other	 aspect	 is	 the	 environment.	 It	 does	 not
determine	 the	 individual	 factor.	 It	 only	 conditions	 that	 through	 which	 this
individual	factor	has	to	express	itself.

In	the	calculation	of	the	chart	of	the	“pre-natal	epoch”	(which,	besides,	does
not	seem	to	refer	to	the	exact	and	actual	moment	of	physiological	conception),	a
relation	 is	 established	 between	 the	 Ascendant	 at	 birth	 and	 the	 Moon	 at	 the
approximate	 time	 of	 conception.	 This	 is	 to	 say	 symbolically	 that	 there	 is	 a

moment	 in	 the	 mother’s	 life,	 about	 the	 time	 of	 conception,	 when	 she
foreshadows	 in	 her	 creative	 imagination	 what	 the	 individual	 self	 of	 her	 future
child	will	be.

We	 might	 conclude	 by	 saying,	 as	 previously,	 that	 the	 reason	 why	 it	 is	 so
difficult	to	ascertain	exactly	the	cusps	of	the	houses	and	all	elements	referring	to
the	axial	rotation	of	the	Earth	is	that	they	symbolize	the	true	individual	factor	in
man.	And	this	individual	factor	is	indeed	sacred.	It	is	well,	therefore,	that	it	be
hidden	from	the	scrutiny	of	the	indiscreet	and	the	curious.	The	exact	degree	of
the	Ascendant	is	the	key	to	man’s	uniqueness	 of	being	 and	 destiny.	In	 a	 world
where	the	individual	is	scorned	and	so	often	crucified	by	collective	stupidity,	we
should	perhaps	rejoice	in	the	fact	that	the	Ascendant,	and	all	the	cusps,	which	are
the	gateways	to	man’s	innermost	creative	selfhood	and	to	his	creative	freedom,
are	usually	veiled	in	mystery.

### The	“Building	of	the	Temple”	and	the	Point	of	Self

As	 we	 close	 this	 part	 of	 our	 study,	 which	 deals	 with	 the	 factor	 of	 time-
evolution	 in	 astrology,	 we	 wish	 to	 come	 back	 to	 a	 matter	 which	 we	 have
previously	 mentioned,	 but	 which	 we	 are	 now	 in	 a	 much	 better	 position	 to
understand.	 We	 opened	 our	 discussion	 of	 progressions	 and	 the	 like	 by
considering	 what	 we	 called	 the	 “time-analysis	 of	 the	 birth-chart.”	 But	 another
type	of	time-analysis	of	the	birth-chart	has	been	studied	in	our	chapter	“The	Dial
of	Houses”	(Cf.	pp.	187,	189).	If	we	mention	it	again	now,	it	is	because	to	our
mind	both	these	types	of	time-analysis	go	deeper	into	the	matter	of	ascertaining
the	real	values	of	“becoming”	than	any	other	more	usual	methods	which	bring	in
planetary	factors	produced	after	birth.

All	 these	 methods	 (progressions,	 directions,	 transits)	 fail	 to	 consider	 the
individual	 as	 a	 whole,	 susceptible	 of	 perfection.	 They	 break	 the	 singleness,
uniqueness	and	unity	of	astrological	sym-bolization.	They	spread	out	birth	into
an	 indefinite	 period	 of	 minutes,	 days,	 or	 years;	 and	 they	 show	 man	 beginning
cycles	of	development	which	he	cannot	normally	complete	in	the	present	state	of
human	 destiny.	 They	 show	 him	 with	 the	 three	 parts	 of	 his	 nature	 evolving
according	to	rhythms	which	do	not	exactly	match.	In	this,	it	is	true,	lies	freedom
—but	also	unfulfillment.

In	 the	 procedure	 explained	 in	 “The	 Dial	 of	 Houses”	 we	 deal	 with	 cyclic
fulfillment.	 Man	 is	 seen	 as	 able	 to	 complete	 the	 building	 of	 his	 temple	 of
immortality	within	the	span	of	84	years	(three	28-year	cycles).	He	is	seen	as	the
experiencer	of	whole	cycles	of	experience,	through	which	all	his	planets,	and	all

their	 mutual	 relationships	 of	 any	 conceivable	 type	 (Parts,	 aspects,	 etc.),	 are
successively	 energized	 and	 expressed.	 Here,	 indeed,	 is	 a	 positive,	 constructive
view	 of	 Man,	 a	 God	 in	 the	 making;	 whereas	 in	 progressions,	 directions	 and
transits	we	are	made	to	witness	the	spectacle	of	a	runner	starting	on	a	threefold
race	 which	 he	 cannot	 possibly	 hope	 to	 finish.	 His	 “progressed	 Sun”	 will	 never
complete	 the	 zodiacal	 race.	 His	 “directional	 Mid-Heaven”	 will	 never	 know	 a
complete	 day	 of	 activity.	 The	 transiting	 Sun	 will	 never	 set	 upon	 a	 personality
fulfilled	through	the	“370	leaps”	of	the	Great	Serpent	of	Eternity,	of	which	the
Kabbala	and	H.	P.	Blavatsky	speak	(Cf.	p.	155).

What,	then,	is	the	use	of	being	born,	if	the	individual	is	fated	to	be	defeated
by	the	race	karma	and	cannot	hope	to	reach	the	goal	of	wholeness?	Is	there	no
man	who,	within	the	normal	compass	of	our	present	Earth-life,	does	ever	reach
fulfillment?	 If	 fulfillment	 is	 possible	 for	 the	 individual,	 in	 spite	 of	 the	 racial
environment—if	not	as	an	outer	personality,	at	least	as	an	individual	self—then
progressions,	 directions	 and	 transits	 alike	 tell	 only	 one	 part	 of	 the	 story	 of	 the
life-process.	 They	 may	 deal	 with	 the	 tangible	 Earth-body	 and	 the	 racial
personality;	but	there	is	a	realm	which	they	do	not	consider—the	only	realm,	it
seems,	in	which	the	individual	may	reach	completion,	and	thus—immortality.

The	time	analysis	which	we	presented	in	the	last	chapter	does	not	attempt	to
chart	 the	 wholeness	 of	 any	 cycle	 of	 development.	 It	 sets	 no	 particular	 limits,
refers	 to	 no	 particular	 cycle.	 It	 merely	 gives	 information	 concerning	 certain
critical	 moments	 in	 the	 process	 of	 working	 out	 in	 actuality	 the	 implications
contained	 in	 the	 birth-chart.	 But	 such	 critical	 moments	 could	 be	 theoretically
repeated	 ad	 infinitum.	 Even	 the	 equation	 “one	 degree	 equals	 a	 year”	 is	 not	 a
necessary	factor	of	such	a	“time	analysis.”	For,	as	we	conceive	this	method,	it	is
only	 a	 matter	 of	 abstract	 relationship	 between	 twenty-four	 set	factors.	 What	 it
really	 intends	 to	 show	 is	 not	 the	 exact	 time	 of	 an	 occurrence	 as	 much	 as	 the
sequence	 of	 the	 operations	 involved	 in	 the	 process	 of	 actualizing	 the
potentialities	 shown	 in	 the	 birth-chart.	 In	 other	 words,	 the	 building	 operations
may	be	speeded	up,	but	the	roof	will	not	be	placed	before	the	walls	are	built,	nor
will	 the	 walls	 be	 built	 before	 the	 foundations	 are	 dug.	 What	 the	 time-analysis
reveals,	 therefore,	 is	 a	 sequence	 of	 operations;	 and	 the	 one-degree-a-year
equation	is	only	a	coefficient	which	appears	to	be	the	most	nearly	accurate	at	the
present	rate	of	human	endeavor.	In	some	personalities	a	faster	coefficient	might
be	 more	 effective;	 for	 instance	 a	 2½-degrees-for-a-year	 equation	 has	 been
suggested	 by	 Carter	 (the	 twelfth	 part	 of	 a	 zodiacal	 sign),	 and	 in	 many	 cases	 it
gives	very	significant	results.

When	 we	 detailed	 the	 method	 by	 which	 the	 individual’s	 progress	 through
three	 28-year	 cycles	 could	 be	 charted,	 we	 also	 wrote	 that	 this	 was	 a	 way	 to
determine	the	schedule	of	operations	in	the	building	of	the	temple	of	Man.	But
by	 the	 very	 nature	 of	 this	 type	 of	 time-analysis	 of	 the	 birth-chart	 we	 deal	 with
closed	 cycles.	 We	 deal	 with	 very	 definite—archetypal—time-limits	 with
reference	 to	 one	 life-span.	 What	 is	 not	 done	 when	 it	 should	 have	 been	 done	 is
left	 forever	 undone.	 But	 the	 terms	 “done”	 or	 “undone”	 do	 not	 refer	 to
personality-behavior	as	much	as	to	individual	realizations.	Here	is	an	unveiling
of	the	depths	of	being,	a	solemn	probing	into	the	sanctuary	of	the	individual	soul
—into	the	realm	of	pure	significance.

This	 is	 particularly	 evident	 as	 we	 compare	 the	 cycle	 of	 progressions	 of	 the
Moon	which	occurs	in	over	27	years,	closely	approximating	the	28-year	cycle	of
what	 we	 called	 the	 Point	 of	 Self;	 also	 the	 cycle	 of	 transiting	 Saturn,	 which
covers	 a	 somewhat	 longer	 period.	 Whereas	 the	 progressed	 Moon	 indicates
mostly	 phases	 of	 outer	 being,	 and	 the	 transiting	 Saturn	 the	 slow	 deepening	 or
crystallization	of	the	ego-factor,	the	Point	of	Self	refers	to	values	that	are	purely
interior,	 but	 which	 shed	 light	 upon	 the	 most	 secret	 determination	 of	 the
individual,	and	his	ability	or	inability	to	give	meaning	to	life.

In	closing,	let	us	warn	the	student	of	the	cyclic	motions	of	the	Point	of	Self,
lest	 he	 forget	 that	 this	 point	 is	 not	 really	 a	 mere	 point,	 but	 a	 cross.	 The	 four
angles	of	the	chart	(the	two	axes	of	individual	selfhood,	horizon	and	meridian)
must	be	seen	rotating	through	the	28-year	cycle.	Subtle	changes	of	focalization
occur,	 emphasizing	 in	 some	 cases	 the	 horizon-factor,	 in	 others	 the	 meridian-
factor.	It	is	only	as	those	are	carefully	studied,	in	function	of	indications	given	by
the	birth-chart	 as	a	 whole,	 that	 this	 method	brings	forth	 a	 really	valid,	because
complete,	 picture	 of	 the	 inner	 life	 of	 the	 individual.	 Through	 it	 we	 can	 see,
outlining	itself	dimly	or	vividly	against	the	background	of	the	more	obvious	and
concrete	 progressions	 and	 transits,	 the	 slowly	 unfolding	 pattern	 of	 individual
fulfillment.	Here	man	may	be	discerned,	a	success	or	a	failure—in	terms,	not	of
what	he	does,	but	of	the	significance	and	the	beauty	with	which	he	invests	every
life-incident	on	his	path	toward	god-hood—or	annihilation.

## PRINCIPLES	OF	ASTROLOGICAL
## INTERPRETATION

Interpretation,	 in	 order	 to	 be	 fully	 significant	 and	 creative,	 must	 needs	 be
individual.	 No	 man,	 therefore,	 should	 tell	 another	 man	 how	 to	 interpret	 his
experience	or	any	life-structure	and	event	with	which	he	is	confronted.	All	that
can	be	 done	 is	to	 establish	a	few	general	principles	of	interpretation	which	are
universally	 valid,	 and	 which	 may	 serve	 as	 milestones	 in	 the	 process	 of
interpretation,	which	should	be	determined,	for	each	individual,	by	the	manner	in
which	he	has	succeeded	in	interpreting	the	basic	fact	of	his	experience:	himself.

The	 interpretation	 of	 a	 birth-chart	 is	 no	 different	 from	 the	 interpretation	 of
any	life-situation,	nor	from	the	interpretation	of	a	work	of	art	or	of	a	personality
which	 one	 meets	 for	 the	 first	 time.	 Granted	 that,	 in	 order	 to	 interpret	 an
astrological	 birth-chart,	 one	 should	 first	 of	 all	 be	 thoroughly	 cognizant	 of	 the
general	 significance	 of	 astrological	 facts,	 or	 rather	 symbols;	 granted	 that	 a
knowledge	of	the	contents	of	the	preceding	chapters	of	this	book	is	a	prerequisite
to	 an	 interpretation	 which	 would	 be	 true	 at	 least	 to	 the	 attitude	 to	 astrology
which	 we	 uphold—it	 still	 remains	 that	 in	 astrological	 interpretation	 there	 is
nothing	either	more	mysterious	or	less	mysterious	than	in	any	other	instance	of
life-interpretation.	 Universal	 principles	 have	 been	 stated,	 defining	 the	 general
character	 of	 the	 symbols	 used.	 It	 is	 for	 the	 individual	 to	 let	 these	 symbols
organize	 themselves	 into	 wholes	 of	 significance	 within	 his	 own	 particular
structure	of	understanding.

It	 sounds	 very	 simple,	 and	 yet,	 evidently,	 it	 may	 be	 very	 difficult.	 The
beginner	 will	 “not	 know	 how	 to	 start.”	 He	 will	 stare	 at	 the	 chart	 in	 dumb
bewilderment,	and	nothing	will	happen.	Or	else	he	will	tabulate	every	factor	he
can	think	of	and	look	in	text-books	for	what	each	factor	is	said	to	mean.	And	if
he	 tries	 to	 add	 these	 separate	 meanings,	 he	 will—barring	 exceptional	 cases—
find	a	hopelessly	confusing	situation,	in	which	many	factors	will	negate	as	many

others.	Establishing	an	average	will	prove	of	very	little	use,	as	human	beings	are
not	 so	 conveniently	 simple	 as	 that	 procedure	 would	 suggest	 them	 to	 be.
Especially,	 they	 are	 not	 sum	 totals	 of	 separate	 factors,	 but	 rather	 an	 organic
relationship	 of	 relations	 between	 factors.	 Shall	 one	 therefore	 start	 with	 the
“factors,”	 or	 with	 the	 “relations	 between	 factors,”	 or	 even	 with	 the	 “organic
relationship	between	relations”?

Every	potential	interpreter	must	decide	for	himself—according	to	the	nature
of	 his	 own	 understanding.	 Some	 will	 go	 from	 the	 whole	 to	 the	 parts,	 then	 to
relations	between	 parts,	 and	again	will	reconsider	the	whole	as	an	organism	 of
relations.	Others	will	just	as	wisely	analyze	parts,	then	relations	between	parts,
and	 will	 sum	 up	 by	 centering	 the	 meanings	 already	 determined	 around	 some
center	of	significance,	or	“focal	determinator.”

There	is,	however,	a	primary	operation,	not	mentioned	so	far,	which	is	really
the	 foundation—though	 ordinarily	 an	 unconscious	 one—of	 the	 subsequent
process	 of	 interpretation.	 Such	 an	 operation	 is	 implied	 in	 the	 very	 first	 look
which	one	casts	at	an	astrological	chart;	for	every	man,	looking	at	a	chart	to	be
interpreted,	will	have	or	should	have	determined,	clearly	or	not,	as	a	background
for	further	investigation,	what	he	is	looking	for.	By	this	rather	blunt	statement	we
mean	his	a	priori	attitude	toward	whatever	data	are	included	in	the	chart.	Some
interpreters	will	have	decided	beforehand,	unconsciously	if	not	deliberately,	that
they	are	looking	for	good	and	evil	planets,	benefics	and	malefics,	good	and	bad
aspects,	 fortunate	 and	 unfortunate	 signs	 and	 stars.	 They	 will	 scan	 progressions
for	fortunate	and	unfortunate	events.	Other	interpreters	will	look	for	the	picture
of	a	human	being	and	a	destiny,	and	will	interpret	this	and	that	planet	or	sign	as
an	etcher	deals	with	black	and	white	values,	a	painter	with	chiaroscuro.

In	 other	 words,	 two	 basic	 attitudes	 toward	 interpretation	 are	 possible—and
many	 secondary	 blends	 of	 these	 two,	 besides:	 the	 ethical	 and	 the	 esthetical
attitudes.	 We	 have	 already	 defined	 in	 general	 these	 two	 approaches	 to	 an
evaluation	 and	 understanding	 of	 life	 in	 our	 chapter	 “Astrology	 and	 Analytical
Psychology.”	 What	 remains	 to	 be	 done	 is	 briefly	 to	 show	 how	 the	 esthetical
attitude	operates	precisely	in	the	field	of	chart-interpretation.	The	working	of	the
“ethical”	 attitude	 hardly	 needs	 to	 be	 discussed,	 as	 every	 text-book	 of	 post-
medieval	 and	 even	 modern	 astrology,	 and	 the	 ordinary	 type	 of	 astrological
practice,	are	sufficient	exemplifications	of	the	ethical	method	and	of	its	dualistic
valuations:	good	and	evil.	But	the	“esthetical”	approach	is	still	a	mystery	for	an
overwhelming	majority	of	astrological	students.

The	 reason	 why	 this	 is	 so	 is	 undoubtedly	 that	 any	 interpretation	 and
evaluation	 of	 life	 and	 of	 its	 two	 basic	 elements—such	 as	 male	 and	 female,	 the
Chinese	Yang	and	Yin,	light	and	darkness,	positive	and	negative—have	thus	far
been	 established	 at	 the	 physiological-natural	 level	 of	 consciousness.	 In	 other
words,	man’s	vital	attitude	has	thus	far	been	based	on	his	instincts,	and	colored
by	the	result	of	instinctual	activities.	Light	and	summer	were	good	because	life
was	safer	and	easier	when	both	were	in	the	ascendancy;	but	darkness	and	winter
were	 bad	 because	 life	 was	 more	 unsafe	 and	 harder	 when	 they	 held	 sway.	 In	 a
similar	 way,	 there	 was	 an	 ethical	 under-valuation	 of	 woman	 and	 an	 over-
valuation	of	man;	for	a	man	was	better	able	to	work	for	his	life	in	the	“jungle,”
and	a	woman	was	weighed	down	by	physiological	difficulties.

Until	 recently	 mankind	 has	 been	 in	 the	 strictly	 physiological	 stage	 of	 its
development—as	 we	 saw	 in	 the	 first	 chapter	 of	 this	 book.	 The	 Hindu	 Puranas
speak	 of	 this	 stage	 as	 that	 of	 “hand	 and	 sex	 power.”	 A	 most	 interesting
characterization!	“Hand	power”	refers	to	muscular	activity,	and	in	terms	thereof
the	 passive-woman	 pole	 is	 seen	 as	 inferior.	 As	 for	 “sex	 power,”	 it	 all	 depends
upon	the	way	sex	is	considered.	As	the	manifestation	of	the	creative	force	and	of
life,	sex	makes	of	the	woman,	as	mother,	the	positive:	thus	matriarchy.	But	as	a
mode	of	“activity”	(muscular	and	otherwise),	it	makes	of	man	the	positive.	The
type	of	environment	in	which	human	tribes	lived	had	undoubtedly	much	to	do	in
determining	which	attitude	was	held.	As	a	result,	we	have	the	conflict	between
the	matriarchal	and	the	patriarchal	systems.

All	 realms	 of	 human	 relationship,	 from	 family	 life	 to	 tribal	 and	 national
social	 organizations,	 have	 been	 pervaded	 by	 the	 more	 or	 less	 conscious
physiological	type	of	valuation.	Moreover,	all	that	has	seemed	valid	for	the	vast
majority	 of	 men	 has	 been	 the	 effort	 to	 perpetuate	 at	 all	 cost	 the	 physical
organism	 in	 a	 condition	 of	 relative	 physiological	 health	 and	 psychological
happiness.	 Thus	 everything	 that	 tended	 to	 disrupt—even	 temporarily—health
and	 happiness	 (plus	 prosperity)	 has	 been	 evaluated	 as	 evil;	 while	 that	 which
consolidated	or	established	health,	happiness	and	prosperity	has	been	considered
good.	 Everything	 that	 gave	 rise	 to	 a	 sense	 of	 pressure	 or	 weight,	 to	 any
disturbances	 from	 the	 happy	 normality	 of	 home,	 religion,	 and	 traditional
behavior,	has	been	labelled	“bad.”	Thus	Saturn	and	Mars	are	malefics.	Squares
are	 bad	 aspects.	 Oppositions,	 and	 the	 doubts	 they	 generate	 (as	 necessary
stimulations	to	further	efforts	of	understanding)	are	also	bad.	But	the	expansive
Jupiter	and	the	home-building	Venus	are	benefics;	and	trines	which	bring	in	new
perspectives	and	new	plans	are	good	aspects.

As,	 however,	 man’s	 consciousness	 begins	 to	 establish	 itself	 at	 the	 psycho-
mental	level,	and	to	conceive	its	relation	to	a	greater	Whole,	the	power	of	which
it	 may	 deliberately	 focalize	 as	 the	 foundation	 for	 super-personal	 yet	 conscious
activity,	 the	 matter	 of	 maintenance	 of	 the	 physical	 organism,	 the	 problem	 of
health-happiness-prosperity,	 and	 the	 instinctive	 fear	 of	 that	 which	 might	 break
the	comfort	of	blood-relationships	and	earth-born	traditions	—all	these	take	on
different	valuations.	At	a	transitional	stage	the	“good-bad”	consideration	seems
for	a	time	strenuously	emphasized,	though	there	is	a	transference	of	the	focus	of
discrimination—as	we	can	see	in	Christian	ethics;	but	later	still,	life	begins	to	be
considered	truly	“beyond	good	and	evil”—and	even	beyond	happiness.	It	begins
to	 be	 seen	 from	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the	 creative	 artist,	 who	 knows	 well	 that
“blacks”	are	just	as	necessary	and	just	as	significant	as	“whites”	in	a	black-and-
white	 drawing;	 that	 without	 both	 there	 could	 be	 no	 form	 and	 therefore	 no
significance.	 Then	 the	 esthetical	 attitude	 toward	 life	 is	 born—the	 attitude	 of
“operative	wholeness,”	the	goal	of	“release	of	power	through	significant	form.”
For	 such	 an	 attitude	 there	 are	 neither	 “good”	 nor	 “bad,”	 but	 only	 degrees	 of
actualization	 of	 meaning	 through	 forms	 conveying	 more	 or	 less	 purely	 and
precisely	 such	 meaning.	 Every	 life	 is	 a	 work	 of	 art	 which	 either	 successfully
conveys	 the	 meaning	 that	 prompted	 it	 into	 being,	 or	 turns	 out	 as	 a	 formless,
inexpressive,	 unconvincing,	 trite,	 “wishy-washy”	 conglomeration	 of	 inchoate
efforts	that	have	led	nowhere—or	else	as	an	almost	blank	sheet	of	substance	but
vaguely	 suggesting	 commonplace,	 utterly	 non-individual,	 and	 meaningless
shapes.

### The	 following	 statements—in	 a	 somewhat	 negative	 way—may	 serve	 as

### postulates	of	the	esthetical	attitude	toward	astrological	interpretation:

A.	There	is	no	bad	planet.	Every	planet	has	a	definite	function.	Every	function
is	 necessary	 to	 the	 achievement	 of	 organic	 wholeness.	 Elimination	 is	 as
valuable	as	assimilation.	The	boil	which	frees	the	system	from	poisons	is	as
valuable	as	the	flesh	which	rounds	up	the	angles	of	the	bones.

B.	 There	 is	 no	 bad	 aspect.	 Involution	 is	 as	 necessary	 as	 evolution.	 The
destruction	 of	 forms	 that	 have	 become	 dead	 shells	 and	 the	 release	 of	 the
power	they	held	are	as	valuable	as	the	building	of	new	forms.	Tensions	are	as
valuable	as	ease,	and	more	creative.

C.	Each	zodiacal	sign	is	as	good	to	be	born	in	as	any	other.	There	is	no	better
birth-month	or	birth-day.	What	matters	only	is	to	fulfill	 the	life-function	or
“quality”	revealed	by	the	sign	or	degree-symbol.

D.	 No	 birth-chart	 is	 better	 than	 any	 other.	 One	 is	 always	 better	 for	 some	 one
purpose.	 But	 as	 all	 purposes	 are	 equally	 valuable	 and	 necessary	 in	 the
economy	of	the	greater	Whole,	each	man’s	chart	is	better	for	the	purposes	of
his	life	than	is	anybody	else’s.

If	 there	 is	 any	 “evil,”	 it	 lies	 in	 the	 absolute	 identification	 of	 the	 consciousness
and	of	the	“I”	with	only	one	particular	phase	of	one’s	totality,	instead	of	with	the
wholeness	of	being.	Evil	is	thus	over-emphasis;	or	rather,	it	is	the	fact	of	the	“I”
being	bound	to	and	biased	by	such	an	over-emphasis.	Any	planet,	in	that	sense,
is	 “bad”	 where	 it	 flares	 up	 into	 a	 prominence	 which	 negates	 the	 compensatory
operation	 of	 its	 polar	 opposite.	 Any	 element	 of	 a	 chart,	 when	 it	 is	 seen	 to
dominate	 utterly	 and	 to	 pull	 to	 itself	 the	 nearly	 total	 energy	 of	 the	 field	 of
consciousness,	becomes	“bad.”	Sooner	or	later	its	domination	must	be	broken,	if
the	man	is	to	achieve	wholeness.

This	 does	 not	 invalidate	 “focalization.”	 But	 to	 focalize	 the	 totality	 of	 one’s
energy	for	the	fulfillment	of	an	individual—and	even	more,	of	a	super-personal
—purpose,	 is	 one	 thing;	 to	 identify	 one’s	 “I”	 with	 one	 single	 part	 of	 the
wholeness	 of	 the	 being,	 so	 that	 all	 other	 parts	 become	 thwarted	 in	 their
development,	is	another	thing.	Only	the	latter	can	be	called	“bad,”	if	one	insists
on	 using	 such	 an	 unfortunate	 qualification!	 And	 even	 such	 a	 “badness”	 may
easily	be	a	purely	temporary	matter,	which	turns	out	to	be	a	valuable	phase	of	a
development	 which	 proceeds	 by	 sharp	 contrasts.	 Thus	 we	 must	 be	 careful	 lest
we	transfer	the	ethical	valuation	of	“good”	and	“bad”	to	the	new	level,	and	call
the	whole	“good”	and	the	parts	“bad.”	Where	there	is	at	least	relative	evil	is	not
in	the	part	being	a	part,	but	 in	the	wholeness	of	the	whole	abdicating	to	a	 part
which	claims	to	be	or	to	rule	the	whole.	In	that	sense,	evil	is	to	become	what	one
is	not;	and	good,	to	fulfill	what	one	is.	The	law	of	life,	the	good	law,	is	the	law	of
fulfillment	of	dharma,	that	is,	of	that	which	one	inherently	and	archetypally	is.

### And	thus	we	are	led	in	thought	back	to	the	great	Hindu	book,	the	Bhagavad

### Gita,	which	says,	in	the	third	chapter:

“Therefore	 perform	 thou	 that	 which	 thou	 hast	 to	 do,	 at	 all	 times
unmindful	 of	 the	 event;	 for	 the	 man	 who	 doeth	 that	 which	 he	 hath	 to	 do,
without	attachment	to	the	result,	ob-taineth	the	Supreme	...	It	is	better	to	do
one’s	 own	 duty	 (dharma),	even	 though	 it	 be	 devoid	 of	 excellence,	 than	 to
perform	another’s	duty	well.	It	is	better	to	perish	in	the	performance	of	one’s
own	duty;	the	duty	of	another	is	full	of	danger.”

To	become	what	one	is;	to	become	the	fullness	of	what	one	is;	in	other	words,	to
live	whole—even	if	this	wholeness	is	subsequently	to	be	focalized	utterly	upon
one	task,	to	the	performance	of	which	every	element	of	the	being	contributes	by
deliberate	 transference	 and	 psychic	 substitution—such	 is	 the	 ageless	 and
universal	 ideal	 for	 the	 individual.	 It	 means	 the	 perfect	 correlation	 of	 all	 values
within	the	personality	on	its	way	toward	full	individuation.	It	means	the	perfect
correlation	 of	 individual	 and	 collective	 factors	 in	 the	 creative,	 ceaselessly
operating.	 The	 collective	 provides	 the	 substantial	 elements;	 the	 individual
provides	a	form	of	organization,	or	structure—which	is	the	exteriorization	of	the
monadic	“quality,”	which	in	turn	is	the	spiritual	identity	of	the	creative.	And	out
of	 this	 ever-active,	 ever-sounding	 chord	 of	 being	 and	 becoming—of	 becoming
operating	in	and	through	being,	 of	being	 substantialized	and	made	operative	in
and	through	becoming—	emerges	the	creative	wholeness	of	the	organic	whole.

Astrology	 illustrates,	 exemplifies,	 provides	 applications	 for	 all	 these
correlations.	 But	 it	 too	 must	 be	 understood	 whole.	 It	 too	 must	 be	 integrated	 in
and	through	an	esthetic	approach	which	alone	can	reveal	a	totality	of	meaning.
We	 have	 seen	 previously	 how	 this	 correlation	 of	 being	 and	 becoming	 can	 be
perceived	 in	 and	 through	 the	 interaction	 of	 birth-chart,	 progressions,	 directions
and	transits.	Here	again	we	can	point	to	the	fallacy,	evident	in	so	much	present-
day	astrological	practice,	of	considering	birth-chart	and	progressions	apart	from
each	 other.	 An	 aspect	 between	 progressed	 planets	 means	 little,	 unless	 it	 be
related	 to	 the	 birth-chart,	 to	 its	 radical	 planets,	 and	 to	 the	 houses	 in	 which	 the
aspect	 operates.	 Day-by-day	 aspects	 are	 still	 less	 significant	 to	 an	 individual,
unless	 they	 are	 seen	 as	 “transits”	 proper—that	 is,	 referred	 to	 the	 natal	 chart.
Everywhere	the	genius	of	astrology	is	to	be	found	in	correlations,	in	groupings,
in	 balancing	 lights	 against	 shadows,	 blacks	 against	 whites,	 formative	 against
destructive	agencies—accepting	all	of	them	equally	as	functions	of	the	organic
wholeness	 of	 the	 whole,	 discriminating	 against	 none—yet,	 let	 us	 not	 forget,
accepting	 every	 element	 of	 being	 as	 valid	 only	 when	 such	 an	 element	 is	 in	 its
proper	place	at	the	proper	time.

Perhaps	a	musical	analogy	will	help	focalize	our	meaning.	We	spoke	of	the
birth-chart	 as	 the	 “chord	 of	 individual	 being;”	 and,	 at	 least	 by	 implication	 and
together	with	our	previously	studied	time-analysis,	as	the	score	of	the	symphony
in	which	being	and	becoming	 interplay	for	the	purpose	of	ever	fuller	and	 more
manifest	 wholeness.	 What	 the	 astrologer	 should	 discover	 is	 the	 “tonality”	 of
chord	and	symphony.	It	is	this	tonality	of	which	we	spoke	a	moment	ago	as	“the
organic	relationship	of	relations	between	parts.”	Only	he	who	can	uncover	this

individual	tonality	of	a	personality	and	a	destiny	may	be	called	a	real	astrologer.
For	thus	only	can	he	prove	that	he	has	the	power	of	“holistic	perception”	which
reveals	to	him	the	wholeness	of	every	whole.

### Concerning	the	Procedure	of	Interpretation

From	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the	 analytical	 phase	 of	 interpretation—and	 there
should	 always	 be	 such	 a	 phase,	 were	 it	 only	 in	 order	 to	 check	 up	 on	 what	 is
revealed	by	“holistic”	perception-very	little	needs	to	be	added	to	what	has	been
already	 said	 in	 previous	 chapters.	 The	 two	 fundamental	 steps	 of	 the	 analysis
refer	respectively	to	the	“subjective	form,”	constituted	by	the	relation	of	the	dial
of	 houses	 to	 the	 signs	 of	 the	 zodiac	 (viz.,	 the	 zodiacal	 positions	 of	 the	 cusps,
intercepted	signs,	etc.),	and	to	the	“objective	form,”	constituted	by	the	zodiacal
positions	(signs	and	degrees)	and	house	positions	of	the	planets,	singly	and	as	a
group.	These	two	steps	in	the	analysis	are	to	be	followed	by	a	third	one,	as	the
result	of	which	secondary	“factors	of	relation”	between	planets,	planetary	orbits
and	cusps	will	be	determined:	Nodes	and	Parts.

Then	 comes	 what	 we	 have	 called	 the	 “time-analysis	 of	 the	 birth-chart,”
establishing	 a	 general	 “structure	 of	 becoming”	 as	 an	 expression	 of	 the
fundamental	 individuality	 of	 the	 native.	 This	 should	 be	 followed	 and	 modified
by	a	study	of	the	periods	determined	or	suggested	by	the	progressed	motions	of
all	the	radical	planets,	and	by	the	transiting	motions	of	the	slower	planets	(Pluto,
Neptune,	Uranus,	Saturn,	Jupiter)	through	the	expected	span	of	the	native’s	life.
We	 purposely	 said	 “a	 study	 of	 the	 periods”	 of	 these	 progressed	 and	 transiting
planets;	 for	 what	 is	 valuable	 at	 this	 stage	 of	 the	 process	 of	 interpretation	 is	 to
determine	 the	 general	 form	 of	 the	 becoming	 of	 the	 personality,	 and	 a	 general
formula	 showing	 the	 cycles	 during	 which	 the	 outer	 world	 (the	 collective—
society-planetary	conditions)	will	further,	and	those	during	which	it	will	hinder
(or	deepen	through	opposition	and	strain),	the	development	of	the	personality	as
a	whole	and	in	relation	to	its	several	basic	functions.

The	 periods	 of	 planetary	 progressions	 are	 the	 component	 factors	 in	 this
“form	 of	 becoming	 of	 the	 personality”—and	 not	 any	 particular	 aspect	 between
two	 progressed	 planets.	 A	 particular	 aspect	 situated	 in	 a	 particular	 sign	 and
house	(or	usually	in	two	particular	signs	 and	houses)	may	have	significance	in
terms	of	a	particular	type	of	event	or	trend	of	events.	But	this	significance	is	so
intermingled	 with	 the	 meaning	 of	 a	 dozen	 other	 factors,	 there	 are	 so	 many
possible	ways	of	interpreting	its	probable	operation	and	of	locating	it,	either	in
the	 physiological	 or	 in	 the	 psychological	 realm—either	 in	 terms	 of	 emphasis

through	lack	of	something,	or	emphasis	through	too	much	of	that	thing—that	an
absolutely	accurate	prognostication	of	events	through	progressions,	directions	or
transits	 is	 practically	 impossible.	 It	 is	 possible	 and	 startlingly	 accurate	 in	 some
cases;	but	woefully	inaccurate,	either	in	the	time	element	or	in	the	manner	of	its
actualization,	in	just	as	many	other	cases.	When,	therefore,	one	realizes	the	great
influence,	psychologically	speaking,	that	a	prediction	may	exert	upon	a	sensitive
person—and	 we	 all	 are	 subject	 to	 influence,	 some	 unconsciously,	 others
consciously—one	should	also	realize	how	nefarious	a	wrong	prediction	may	be.
The	value	of	astrology	does	not	depend	upon	its	predictive	accuracy,	for	then
it	 would	 have	 relatively	 little	 value,	 save	 in	 the	 hands	 of	 spectacularly	 gifted
astrologers,	 able,	 through	 a	 combination	 of	 “horary”	 and	 “natal”	 astrology,	 to
“hit	the	mark”	in	an	amazingly	great	proportion	of	cases.	It	depends	rather	upon
the	 fact	 that	 it	 provides	 us	 with	 “formulas”	 of	 being	 (birth-chart)	 and	 of
becoming	(time-analysis,	progressions,	etc.)	which	enable	us	to	extract	the	most
significance	 out	 of	 what	 is	happening	 or	 what	 has	 happened.	 If	 we	 assimilate
that	significance	thoroughly,	we	are	then	able	to	face	whatever	will	 happen:	1)
with	an	integrated,	unified	front;	2)	as	a	bestower	of	creative	significance.	By	so
doing	we	shall	be	able	to	“transfigure”	the	future;	not	changing	the	“form”	of	our
being	or	becoming,	but	making	that	form	glow	with	meaning,	harmony	and	light
—as	Jesus	glowed	on	the	Mount	of	Transfiguration.	He	shone	with	Christ-light,
with	the	power	of	universal	energies	and	contents—yet	He	remained	in	form	and
individuality,	Jesus:	Jesus	who	had	become	“Christed.”

To	go	back,	however,	to	the	periods	of	progressions.	If	we	see	in	Mussolini’s
chart	 that	 at	 the	 age	 of	 46	 his	 progressed	 Sun	 will	 conjoin	 Uranus	 and	 trine
Neptune,	 that	 may	 not	 give	 us	 so	 much	 direct	 information	 as	 to	 events	 then
likely	 to	 occur.	 In	 fact,	 as	 far	 as	 can	 be	 gleaned	 from	 his	 outer	 life,	 relatively
little	has	corresponded	at	that	age	to	a	progressed	aspect	which	should	be	capital
in	Mussolini’s	life,	inasmuch	as	the	trine	Uranus	to	Neptune	encompasses	all	his
planets	and	thus	plays	a	most	basic	part	in	his	being	and	destiny.	It	is	true	that
the	agreement	with	the	Pope	was	signed	(February	11,	1929)	around	the	time	of
maturation	 of	 the	 progressed	 aspects;	 but	 granted	 that	 this	 is	 the	 correlation
wanted,	how	could	an	astrologer	studying	the	chart,	say	in	1900,	have	predicted
such	 a	 concrete	 event?	 Moreover,	 why	 should	 this	 Lateran	 treaty	 be	 of	 such
significance	 astrologically	 in	 Mussolini’s	 destiny?	 However,	 we	 may	 approach
the	above-mentioned	solar	progressions	in	another	way.

We	can	determine	the	aspects	made	by	the	progressed	Sun	ever	since	birth.
To	 begin	 with	 the	 later	 ones:	 In	 1916	 the	 progressed	 Sun	 squares	 the	 radical

Saturn;	in	1917	the	radical	Moon,	in	1922	the	radical	Mars;	in	1923	it	comes	to
conjunction	 Part	 of	 Fortune;	 in	 1927	 to	 sextile	 Jupiter;	 then	 in	 1929	 to	 trine
Neptune	and	conjunction	Uranus;	and	in	1930	to	sextile	Venus.	Then	periods	of
progressions	 are	 determined	 by	 considering	 the	 time	 elapsing	 between	 two
aspects.	The	period	of	Sun-Moon	square	operates	from	1916	to	1917;	the	period
of	Sun-Mars	square	ends	 in	1922.	Finally,	the	Sun-Part	of	Fortune	conjunction
period	begins	witnessing	the	“march	upon	Rome”	and	Mussolini’s	accession	to
personal	power.

The	periods	before	this	last	one	are	all	based	on	square	aspects—	ever	since
the	square	of	progressed	Sun	to	Neptune	in	1898	(age	15);	and	before	this	series
of	squares,	there	were	only	sextiles	(to	Moon	and	Mars).	This	at	once	establishes
—from	the	point	of	view	of	 the	basic	solar	progressions—several	well-marked
life	 cycles.	 Up	 to	 the	 age	 of	 15,	 a	 period	 of	 sextiles—the	 routine	 of	 growth
through	 maternal	 influence	 (Moon)	 and	 paternal	 influence	 (Mars).	 Then	 from
1898	to	the	early	spring	of	1922	we	have	a	period	of	struggle	to	bring	down	into
manifestation	and	ideal,	the	struggle	to	be	born	as	a	figure	of	destiny:	all	squares,
symbols	of	incarnation	and	involution.

The	 year	 1922	 is	 dominated	 by	 a	 new	 type	 of	 aspect:	 the	 first	 solar
conjunction—with	the	 Part	of	Fortune.	This	now	means	“emphasis.”	Emphasis
on	 what?	 On	 what	 the	 Part	 of	 Fortune	 represents.	 The	 Part	 of	 Fortune	 is	 the
“Ascendant”	 of	 the	 Moon.	 It	 “distributes”	 and	 focalizes	 the	 Moon’s	 power.
Moon	 represents	 the	 life	 of	 the	 personality	 as	 an	 element	 of	 becoming;	 it
represents	also	“the	public,”	the	collective	confronting	the	individual.	Thus	the
period	 of	 emphasis	 or	 accentuation	 shown	 by	 the	 conjunction	 Sun-Part	 of
Fortune	 focalized	 the	 power	 of	 the	 collective	 upon	 Mussolini’s	 individuality,
accentuated	the	power	of	his	own	personality.	In	the	tenth	house	it	emphasized
authority	and	public	activity;	in	Virgo,	a	cleansing	process	(even	symbolized	by
the	Fascists’	using	castor	oil	on	unwilling	politicians).

It	 would	 be	 futile,	 however,	 to	 find	 a	 day	 or	 month	 when	 this	 conjunction
specifically	operates.	What	is	to	be	understood	is	rather	the	general	meaning	of	a
period.	Likewise,	when	we	speak	of	the	sextile	progressed	Sun-Jupiter,	we	refer
to	 the	 period	 of	 1923-1927,	 a	 period	 of	 establishment	 (sextile)	 of	 authority
(Jupiter).	Then	from	1927	to	1929	we	come	to	the	period	progressed	Sun-trine-
Neptune	 and	 conjunction	 Uranus.	 Obviously,	 we	 have	 then	 a	 period	 during
which	the	power	of	the	collective	unconscious	is	 predominant.	All	Mussolini’s
planets	 are	 enclosed	 within	 the	 trine	 Neptune-to-Uranus.	 As	 the	 Sun	 comes	 to
conjunction	Uranus	it	obviously	ends	a	period	of	personal	emphasis	and	reaches

beyond	 into	 the	 unknown,	 as	 it	 were;	 into	 that	 which	 is	 unaccentuated	 and	 not
brought	out	by	planetary	activities.	Mussolini	reaches	then	beyond	what	he	is	as
a	 personality;	 but	 before	 he	 does	 that	 he	 has	 rounded	 up	 his	 personal	 life	 by
taking	steps	which	close	one	period	and	open	another.	This	is	the	meaning	of	the
Lateran	 Treaty—a	 ubiquitous,	 subtle,	 Neptunian	 meaning;	 and	 of	 the	 definite
establishment	of	the	Italian	“corporate	State”	which,	though	outlined	during	the
Jupiter	period	(1926-1927),	becomes	implanted	into	the	mind	of	the	nation	and
its	collective	unconscious	only	after	1927.

The	period	of	the	sextile	Sun	to	Venus	is	also	a	very	short	one.	It	presumably
refers	 to	 Mussolini’s	 emotional	 life;	 yet	 adds	 conscious	 individual	 meaning	 to
that	 which	 at	 first	 referred	 to	 great	 unconscious	 factors	 (under	 the	 Sun	 to
Uranus-Neptune	 aspects).	 After	 this,	 a	 new	 period	 begins,	 characterized	 by	 the
coming	trine	of	progressed	Sun	to	Pluto,	then	to	Saturn,	Moon	and	Mars.	These
periods	 are	 expansional.	 They	 refer	 to	 the	 formation	 of	 new	 ideals,	 of	 new
relationships,	 new	 alliances.	 The	 future	 will	 show	 whether	 they	 are	 to	 be
interpreted	positively	or	negatively.	In	1939	the	progressed	Sun	is	scheduled	to
enter	Libra;	Mussolini	will	be	then	56.	A	period	of	his	life	which	began	in	1908,
when	he	went	to	Trento,	will	then	end.*

A	 similar	 analysis	 could	 be	 worked	 out	 by	 considering	 not	 only	 the
progressed	 Sun,	 but	 all	 progressed	 planets;	 again	 by	 studying	 the	 periods
constituted	 by	 the	 motions	 of	 the	 slow	 planets,	 after	 birth,	 as	 they	 transit	 over
important	places	in	the	radical	chart.	Here	we	have,	of	course,	a	very	complex
and	multifarious	series	of	aspects,	and	the	greatest	care	has	to	be	exerted	in	order
to	 isolate	 the	 most	 significant	 factors.	 But	 the	 idea	 that	 periods	 are	 more
significant	 than	 the	 exact	 aspects	 marking	 their	 boundaries	 is	 also	 valid—
especially	 as	 with	 slow-transiting	 planets	 these	 are	 periods	 during	 which,
because	of	alternation	of	direct	and	retrograde	motion,	they	pass	back	and	forth
over	sensitive	points	of	the	charts.	Periods	determined	by	the	transiting	motion
of	a	slow	planet	through	a	whole	house	are	particularly	significant.	They	show
the	way	in	which	circumstances	and	collective	forces	basically	affect	the	various
phases	of	individual	being	and	destiny—phases	symbolized	by	the	houses.

Then	 there	 are	 also	 to	 be	 considered	 the	 28-year	 and	 7-year	 cycles	 of	 the
axes	 of	 the	 chart,	 especially	 what	 we	 called	 the	 cyclic	 motion	 of	 the	 Point	 of
Self.	These	cycles	can	be	studied	in	terms	of	their	beginning,	their	mid-point	and
their	conclusion.	They	show	the	inner	workings	of	the	process	of	individuation
at	 its	 three	 successive	 levels—sometimes	 referring	 to	 concrete	 happenings,	 but

then	only	insofar	as	they	focalize	critical	transitions	in	the	general	process.

Finally,	 the	 primary	 directions	 and	 certain	 precise	 transits	 (as	 eclipses	 and
multiple	 conjunctions)	 can	 be	 studied	 to	 sharpen	 the	 contours	 of	 the	 picture
already	drawn.	There	is	a	school	of	astrologers	who	lay	the	basic	emphasis	upon
primary	directions,	and	who	therefore	would	very	much	object	to	our	relegating
them	to	the	end	of	the	process	of	interpretation;	but	they	must	not	forget	that	our
“time-analysis	 of	 the	 birth-chart,”	 which	 we	 placed	 first	 in	 the	 study	 of
becoming,	 gives	 general	 indications	 similar	 to	 or	 almost	 identical	 with	 those
found	 through	 the	 simplest	 method	 of	 directing	 (or	 through	 the	 Radix
directions).	 These,	 we	 believe,	 are	 not	 only	 as	 effective	 as	 the	 main	 primary
directions,	 but	 because	 of	 their	 smaller	 number	 are	 much	 more	 valuable	 to	 a
structural	grasp	of	destiny	as	an	individually	determined	and	significant	whole	of
becoming.	 The	 other	 types	 of	 directions	 may	 be	 very	 significant	 in	 a	 detailed
analysis,	 or	 whenever	 a	 close	 study	 of	 the	 total	 correlations	 of	 astrological
factors	 related	 to	 a	 known	 event	 or	 period	 of	 the	 life	 is	 required;	 and	 in	 such
cases	 all	 the	 transits	 have	 also	 to	 be	 considered.	 But,	 for	 the	 psychological
purposes	 of	 personality-integration	 and	 life-interpretation,	 which	 are	 the	 main
motivations	of	our	approach	to	astrology,	primary	directions	of	the	complex	type
not	 only	 demand	 too	 much	 time	 and	 too	 many	 calculations,	 but	 their	 very
multiplicity	almost	defeats	their	purpose;	for	where	you	have	so	much	to	choose
from	 and	 to	 organize	 in	 order	 to	 determine	 events	 or	 meanings,	 the	 attention
easily	becomes	scattered	and	essentials	fade	out,	obnubilated	by	the	pageant	of
nonessentials.

### Focalization	Through	Chart-rulership

Before	we	conclude	this	chapter,	one	more	point	needs	to	be	mentioned,	as	it
occupies	 an	 important	 place	 in	 the	 practice	 of	 medieval	 and	 modern	 astrology:
the	matter	of	planetary	rulership.

The	principle	of	planetary	rulership	rests	upon	the	idea	that	the	basic	modes
of	biological	and	psychological	activity	(planets)	have	various	types	of	“affinity”
for	the	basic	types	of	life-substance	(signs	of	the	zodiac).	Affinity	of	such	kinds
have	 been	 determined	 in	 traditional	 astrology,	 for	 reasons	 not	 always	 clear	 or
philosophically	 evident.	 Thus	 a	 planet	 is	 said	 to	 “rule”	 one,	 or	 usually	 two,
zodiacal	 signs,	 which	 are	 considered	 as	 the	 planet’s	 “houses.”	 It	 is	 said	 to	 be
“exalted”	in	another	sign.	To	these	positive	valuations	are	added	negative	ones.
In	the	sign	opposite	from	the	sign	of	its	rulership	the	planet	is	in	its	“detriment;”
in	that	opposite	from	the	sign	of	its	exaltation	it	is	said	to	be	in	its	“fall.”	Positive

valuations	 are	 named	 “dignities;”	 negative	 valuations,	 “debilities.”	 The	 above-
mentioned	 are	 the	 most	 important	 among	 dignities	 and	 debilities,	 they	 are
“essential”	 dignities	 or	 debilities.	 To	 these,	 however,	 are	 added	 a	 series	 of
“accidental”	 dignities	 or	 debilities,	 such	 as	 arise	 from	 the	 planet	 being	 in	 an
angle	 and	 well	 aspected	 or	 not	 afflicted,	 from	 its	 being	 swift	 in	 motion,
increasing	in	light,	etc.

The	value	of	such	qualifications	is	obvious.	It	enables	the	astrologer	to	give
quantitative	 valuations	 to	 the	 planets	 and	 thus	 to	 ascertain	 their	 relative
importance	 and	 relative	 weight	 in	 a	 particular	 situation	 or	 in	 the	 make-up	 of	 a
particular	 personality.	 Thus	 a	 “weak”	 Saturn	 will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 neutralize	 a
“strong”	 Jupiter,	 and	 in	 all	 aspects	 between	 these	 planets	 the	 Jupiterian	 quality
will	 have	 the	 greater	 weight.	 Thus	 a	 kind	 of	 thirddimensional	 perspective	 will
emerge	out	of	the	recognition	of	this	quantitative	factor.	Some	planets	will	stand
out	like	stars	of	first	magnitude;	others	will	recede	into	the	background	as	stars
of	 lesser	 magnitudes.	 Thus	 also	 a	 certain	 type	 of	 “focal	 determination”	 will
become	possible,	as	in	the	case	of	a	most	dignified	planet	among	weak	brothers
or	sisters.

Where	the	difficulty	comes	is	in	the	philosophical	or	“holistic”	justification
of	 the	 traditional	 valuations.	 Because	 of	 such	 a	 difficulty,	 new	 systems	 of
“rulership”	 are	 every	 so	 often	 devised,	 usually	 in	 an	 attempt	 to	 remedy	 two	 of
the	 apparent	 weaknesses	 of	 the	 system:	 The	 fact	 that	 Sun	 and	 Moon	 rule	 only
one	sign	each,	while	the	other	planets,	up	to	and	including	Saturn,	rule	two	signs
each;	and	the	other	fact,	i.e.,	that	the	newly	discovered	planets	(Uranus,	Neptune,
Pluto)	 rule	 no	 definite	 sign;	 or	 if	 signs	 are	 attributed	 to	 them	 (as	 Aquarius	 to
Uranus,	 and	 Pisces	 to	 Neptune),	 then	 two	 of	 the	 “older”	 planets	 are	 each	 left
with	only	one	sign	to	rule.	The	confusion,	however,	looks	worse	than	it	actually
is,	and	we	may	be	able	to	clear	up	much	of	the	apparent	difficulty.

First	 of	 all,	 we	 shall	 set	 down	 the	 traditional	 scheme	 of	 ruler-ships,	 as
follows—adding	 at	 the	 outset	 that	 positive	 signs	 (every	 other	 sign	 beginning
with	 Aries)	 are	 called	 the	 “day	 houses”	 of	 the	 planets,	 the	 negative	 signs	 the
“night	houses.”

This	 at	 once	 shows	 that	 Sun	 and	 Moon	 are	 considered	 as	 a	 unit,	 in	 terms	 of
rulership.	 They	 always	 have	 been	 put	 in	 a	 special	 category	 as:	 the	 “lights”—a
valuation	 which	 is,	 as	 we	 often	 said,	 an	 expression	 of	 the	 old	 geocentric
astrology	 interpreting	 celestial	 phenomena	 as	 seen,	 and	 not	 in	 terms	 of	 such	 a
scientific	 intellectual	 knowledge	 as	 that	 which	 today	 constitutes	 heliocentric
astronomy.

Now,	we	may	repeat	the	same	table,	but	this	time	giving	to	the	three	newly
discovered	 planets	 the	 sign	 to	 rule	 which	 has	 seemed	 appropriate	 to	 most
contemporary	astrologers:

It	is	easy	to	see	that	what	is	happening	is	that,	following	the	example	of	the	pair
Sun-Moon,	each	of	the	traditional	planets	is	being	given	a	“mate”	to	which	one

of	the	planet’s	two	original	“houses”	is	delegated	as	a	domain	over	which	to	rule.
From	this	a	new	type	of	planetary	pairing	is	to	be	deduced.	In	a	previous	chapter
we	 studied	 the	 traditional	 coupling	 of	 Saturn	 and	 Moon,	 Jupiter	 and	 Mercury,
and	Mars	and	Venus.	We	modified	such	an	arrangement	so	that	the	Earth	became
consistently	the	center	or	hinge	of	the	coupling	of	“inner”	and	“outer”	planets:
Mars-Venus,	Jupiter-Mercury.	Saturn-Solar	photosphere;—and	the	three	“planets
of	the	unconscious”—Heart	of	the	Sun.	In	this	latter	scheme,	deduced	from	the
structure	 of	 the	 solar	 system	 as	 known	 to	 modern	 astronomy,	 the	 Moon—as	 a
satellite	of	the	Earth-becomes	the	factor	of	linkage	between	the	intra-orbital	and
the	extra-orbital	planets.

And	now	we	see	another	type	of	coupling	emerging	from	Chart	B.	Because
Sun	and	Moon	were	respectively	the	“light	of	day”	and	the	“light	of	night,”	the
Sun	logically	rules	a	positive	(day)	sign,	and	the	Moon	a	negative	(night)	sign.
From	 this	 can	 be	 derived	 a	 general	 explanation	 of	 the	 emergent	 process	 of
polarization	of	all	planetary	rulerships.

Let	us	reconsider	Chart	A,	and	imagine	that	the	Moon	is	not	included,	and
that	the	Sun	has	its	day	and	its	night	houses	(Leo	and	Cancer),	as	all	the	other
planets	have.	We	have	then	the	series	of	planets	in	their	actual	order,	beginning
with	Sun	and	ending	with	Saturn	(not,	of	course,	counting	our	Earth).	If,	on	the
other	 hand,	 we	 correlate	 that	 series	 with	 the	 series	 of	 zodiacal	 signs	 beginning
with	Leo,	we	have	a	very	orderly	arrangement,	into	which	the	newly	discovered
planets	fit	well—except	that	Pluto	is	made	to	rule	Aries	and	not	Scorpio:

We	believe	that	such	an	arrangement	is	most	significant,	but	only	in	terms	of
Man-the-Individual;	or	of	consciousness.	The	first	six	terms	of	both	series	refer
to	the	conscious.	Starting	in	Leo	on	the	path	to	individualization	with	great	solar
spontaneity,	Man	reaches	in	Capricorn	full	and	concrete	individualization	as	an

“I	 am”—in	 a	 personal	 or	 a	 planetary	 sense.	 Then	 he	 begins	 to	 assimilate	 the
beyond,	 the	 contents	 of	 the	 collective	 unconscious—and	 this	 is	 the	 path	 to
individuation.	Through	Uranus,	universals	pour	into	the	particular	ego;	through
Neptune,	the	walls	of	the	ego	become	translucid	to	the	beyond	(or	they	dissolve
altogether,	 most	 unfortunately);	 through	 Pluto,	 a	 new	 beginning	 is	 made:	 the
universal	Order	is	born	at	the	core	of	the	transfigured	particular.	The	Moon,	at
the	end	of	this	incomplete	series,	obviously	stands	for	that	principle	of	universal
relationship	 which	 marks	 the	 end	 of	 the	 path	 to	 individuation;	 just	 as	 Saturn
stood	for	the	principle	of	relationship-within-a-set-form	which	marks	the	end	of
the	path	to	individualization.	Obviously,	the	Moon	is	actually	only	the	negative
aspect	 of	 that	 principle	 of	 universal	 relationship.	 She	 symbolizes	 only
physiological	 motherhood	 and	 the	 integration	 of	 elemental	 life-agencies;
whereas	 whatever	 shall	 take	 her	 place	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 series	 that	 begins	 with
Aquarius	should	represent	spiritual	Motherhood	and	the	integration	of	universal
Life-forces	 and	 Ideas	 at	 the	 psycho-mental	 or	 spiritual	 level—thus	 perhaps	 the
Galaxy	(Milky	Way).

Looking	 at	 Chart	 B	 from	 another	 angle	 (and	 now	 reversing	 the	 places	 of
Mars	 and	 Pluto),	 we	 can	 also	 say	 that	 Saturn	 is	 to	 Uranus,	 Neptune	 to	 Jupiter,
and	 Mars	 to	 Pluto	 as	 the	 Moon	 is	 to	 the	 Sun.	 Stated	 in	 such	 a	 manner,	 the
situation	is	also	quite	clear	and	significant.	Uranus	is	the	breath	of	the	creative	“I
am”	of	which	the	merely	conscious	ego	is	but	a	sort	of	night-reflection;	just	as
the	Moon	reflects	in	a	pale	way	the	integrative	fire	of	the	Sun.	Likewise,	Pluto
represents	cosmic	beginnings	in	a	way	which	Mars	and	its	impulses,	limited	by
physiological	conditioning,	reflect	only	faintly	and	in	a	personal	way.	As	for	the
pair	 Jupiter-Neptune,	 it	 may	 be	 seen	 that	 the	 function	 of	 form-dissolution
symbolized	by	Neptune	has	to	be	considered	as	a	negative	(or	night-pole)	of	the
Jupiterian	function	of	expansion	of	the	life-contents	of	the	form.

However	 this	 may	 be,	 the	 above	 interpretation—while	 probably	 not
acceptable	to	all—does	at	least	give	a	coherent	picture	worth	studying	in	all	its
implications.	 Other	 students	 of	 astrology	 may	 prefer	 Marc	 Jones’	 position,
refusing	 to	 attribute	 any	 rulership	 to	 Uranus	 and	 Neptune	 or	 to	 any	 trans-
Saturnian	planets	 that	may	be	discovered,	because	the	very	idea	of	rulership	is
not	 consistent	 with	 the	 meaning	 of	 such	 planets.	 Rulership	 is	 the	 symbol	 of
organic	 relationship	 between	 activity	 and	 the	 organized	 substance	 involved	 in
such	activity;	and	where	planets	refer	to	the	trans-organic	(that	which	is	beyond
the	limits	of	an	organic	whole)	there	can	be	no	question	of	rulership.	The	answer
to	this,	however,	is	that	a	super-physiological	organism	is	forming	in	individuals

who	 have	 reached	 a	 certain	 point	 in	 their	 development,	 and	 that	 the	 trans-
Saturnian	planets	are	trans-organic	only	insofar	as	the	physiological	organism	is
concerned,	 but	 are	 the	 very	 formative	 agencies	 which	 are	 building,	 in	 all	 men
attuned	to	their	positive-creative	nature,	a	psycho-mental	organism.*

The	 difficulty	 attending	 a	 coherent	 interpretation	 of	 planetary	 rulership	 is
even	 more	 evident	 where	 the	 “exaltation”	 of	 planets	 in	 certain	 zodiacal	 signs,
and	their	“ecstasy”	on	a	certain	degree	of	such	signs,	are	concerned.	So	we	shall
pass	on	and	discuss	only	briefly	the	main	uses	to	which	the	theory	of	rulership
has	been	put.	It	dominates	completely	the	divinatory	branch	of	astrology	called
“horary	astrology”—and	perhaps	it	is	from	horary	astrology	that	it	has	come	to
“natal	 astrology,”	 the	 only	 kind	 of	 astrology	 studied	 in	 this	 work.	 In	 natal
astrology,	the	theory	of	planetary	relationship	not	only	creates	a	sort	of	linkage
between	planets	and	signs—which	is	very	valuable	theoretically	and	logically—
but,	 as	 we	 saw,	 it	 serves	 as	 a	 means	 to	 invest	 some	 planets	 with	 the
characteristics	of	“focal	determinator.”	As	such	it	has	been	used	consistently	in
two	manners;	the	first,	very	much	in	use	today;	the	 second,	very	seldom	taken
into	consideration.

The	 first	 way	 of	 singling	 out	 a	 planet,	 to	 make	 it	 serve	 as	 a	 center	 of
significance,	is	to	find	what	is	called	the	“ruling	planet”	or	“ruler	of	the	chart.”
This	is	usually	determined	by	the	sign	of	the	Ascendant.	The	planet	ruling	this
sign	becomes	the	ruler	of	the	whole	chart.	The	rationale	of	this	method	is	clear.
The	 Ascendant	 represents	 the	 factor	 of	 individual	 selfhood,	 the	 monad,	 the
fountainhead	 of	 the	 life	 and	 destiny	 which	 the	 chart	 as	 a	 whole	 symbolizes.
Therefore	the	planet	functionally	dominating	this	Ascendant	becomes	naturally
the	 dominate	 life-function	 of	 the	 personality.	 However,	 in	 the	 case	 of	 planets
rising	close	to	the	Ascendant,	or	when	a	planet,	wherever	situated	in	the	chart,
“disposes”	of	all	or	most	other	planets,*	then	two	or	more	planets	may	divide	the
honors	of	chart-rulership.

The	second	way	of	singling	out	a	planet	as	a	focal	point	of	the	interpretation
is	 the	 determination	 of	 the	 Almuten.	 The	 Almuten	 is	 found	 by	 tabulating	 the
essential	and	accidental	dignities	and	debilities	of	each	planet	according	to	a	set
of	quantitative	valuations	(5	points	for	this	dignity,	3	points	for	that),	subtracting
the	 sum	 total	 of	 debilities	 from	 that	 of	 dignities	 (or	 vice	 versa),	 and	 thus
discovering	 what	 planet	 has	 received	 the	 highest	 number.	 That	 planet	 is	 the
strongest	 in	 the	 chart.	 It	 is	 said	 to	 determine	 the	 “temperament”	 of	 the	 native.
The	method	is	very	similar	to	that	for	the	determination	of	an	I.Q.—and	perhaps

it	 works	 just	 as	 well—whatever	 that	 means	 in	 the	 reader’s	 estimation!
Mussolini’s	 Almuten	 seems	 to	 be	 Saturn;	 with	 Jupiter	 a	 close	 second.	 This
throws	an	interesting	light	on	his	personal	character;	in	contradistinction	to	the
character	he	has	made	himself	as	the	vehicle	for	a	super-personal,	racial	Idea.

While	 such	 types	 of	 “chart-rulership”	 are	 indeed	 susceptible	 of	 releasing	 a
great	 deal	 of	 significance,	 we	 would	 rather	 stress	 the	 type	 of	 “focal
determination”	 discussed	 in	 the	 chapter	 “Form	 and	 the	 Pattern	 of	 Planetary
Aspects”—that	is,	a	type	which	singles	out	some	group-features	of	the	chart	as	a
whole,	 and	 considers	 that	 feature	 as	 the	 focal	 point	 of	 the	 interpretation.	 For
instance,	we	would	say	that,	in	Mussolini’s	chart,	the	facts	that	all	the	planets	are
contained	within	a	trine	of	Uranus	to	Neptune,	and	that	all	of	them,	save	Uranus,
are	 located	 in	 the	 South-West	 quarter,	 constitute	 the	 most	 significant	 “focal
determination.”	 These	 facts	 center	 the	 multifarious	 meanings	 of	 the	 many
astrological	elements	around	one	primordial	significance;	and	from	that,	a	kind
of	 interpretative	 perspective	 emerges	 which	 seems	 to	 us	 more	 valid	 or	 more
revealing—at	least	in	view	of	our	approach	to	astrology—than	that	which	would
result	 from	 giving	 quantitative	 valuations	 of	 strength	 or	 weakness	 to	 every
separate	planet.

## Conclusion

With	this	brief	study	of	some	of	the	main	principles	upon	which	a	technique
of	 astrological	 interpretation	 can	 be	 built,	 which	 would	 be	 consistent	 with	 our
approach	 to	 astrology,	 we	 must	 bring	 to	 a	 close	 this	 section	 consecrated	 to	 a
reformulation	 and	 reinterpretation	 of	 the	 fundamental	 elements	 of	 astrological
symbolism.	Astrology,	defined	as	an	algebra	of	life,	is	absolutely	protean	in	its
manifestation,	 and	 multifarious	 in	 the	 wide	 diversity	 of	 its	 approaches	 to
particular	 phases	 of	 interpretation.	 Wherefore	 we	 feel	 most	 acutely	 how
incomplete	 has	 been	 the	 reformulation	 presented	 in	 the	 chapters	 of	 this	 second
section.	 Nevertheless	 we	 trust	 that	 fundamentals	 have	 been	 established	 on	 a
coherent	basis	of	both	symbolical-logical	and	psychological	understanding;	and
we	may	be	able	in	some	not	too	distant	future	to	study	at	much	greater	length,
and	in	relation	to	many	more	practical	instances,	some	of	the	astrological	factors
the	meaning	of	which	we	have	here	outlined.

Here	again,	however,	we	may	add—as	a	final	restatement—that	astrology	in
its	essence	is	not	bound	to	any	particular	application	or	field	of	application;	that
its	 truths	 are	 not	 empirical	 in	 character	 nor	 dependent	 for	 their	 success	 on	 one
realm	of	life	or	another.	Physicists	may	conceivably	find	that	their	approach	to

the	 problem	 of	 determining	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 atom	 or	 of	 distant	 galaxies	 is	 all
wrong,	and	that	their	experiments	have	been	so	devised	as	to	leave	out	the	main
factor	in	intra-atomic	or	in	cosmic	behavior.	 Yet	 such	a	discovery	 would	in	no
way	 invalidate	 group-algebra	 or	 any	 of	 the	 mathematical	 symbols	 which	 have
been	 used	 to	 establish	 present-day	 interpretations,	 and	 could	 be	 used	 to	 build
new	 theories.	 The	 number	 10	 remains	 a	 valid	 symbol	 even	 if	 the	 ten	 apples
grouped	 by	 it	 into	 numerical	 relationship	 turn	 out	 to	 be	 peaches.	 Likewise
consider	a	square	of	Jupiter	to	Saturn;	we	may	now	say	that	it	refers	to	“spiritual
testing	and	tribulations,”	but	such	a	saying	has	validity	only	in	terms	of	what	we
call	“tests	and	tribulations”	in	our	understanding	of	human	psychology.	Modify
this	psychology,	and	the	meaning	of	the	square	will	change.

And	lastly,	astrology	does	not	offer	interpretations	as	clear-cut	and	objective
as	 does	 modern	 physics.	 The	 ideal	 of	 modern	 science	 is	 anonymity	 and
objectivity—that	 is,	 the	 total	 suppression	 of	 the	 individual	 element.	 This	 does
not	mean,	however,	that	modern	science	does	not	give	us	“interpretation;”	for	so-
called	“scientific	laws”	are,	after	all,	generalized	interpretations	of	processes	and
congeries	 of	 facts.	 But	 such	 generalized	 interpretations	 —arrived	 at	 by	 way	 of
mathematical	symbolization—are	not	considered	really	valid	until	there	is	left	no
known	 individual	 exception,	 and	 until	 a	 relatively	 absolute	 assurance	 that	 the
future	processes	will	always	work	out	in	terms	of	the	laws	is	made	possible	for
every	one	concerned.

As	a	result,	modern	science	is	obliged	to	ignore	the	individualness	of	every
living	 entity.	 It	 reduces	 every	 such	 entity	 to	 its	 generic	 type,	 and	 ignores	 or
denies	the	individual	factor	and	its	uniqueness.	And	what	is	unique	in	any	living
whole?	At	first,	in	the	evolutionary	process	which	leads	from	amoeba	to	man,	it
is	 only	 the	 most	 infinitesimal	 detail	 of	 organic	 disposition.	 Then,	 as	 evolution
proceeds	on	its	course	toward	greater	differentiation,	the	small	individual	detail
of	 super-structure	 is	 magnified	 until	 an	 organic	 system	 becomes	 adequately
developed	 for	 individual	 differentiation.	 The	 individualistic	 super-structure	 not
only	coalesces	with	the	generic	structure,	but	more	and	more	influences	it.

Then	 in	 man	 we	 find,	 within	 his	 total	 organic	 structure,	 a	 generic	 under-
structure	(the	Great	Sympathetic	system)	 and	 an	 individual	 super-structure	 (the
cerebro-spinal	 system);	 and	 the	 latter	 is	 seen	 increasingly	 to	 dominate	 the
former.	 Then	 we	 say	 that	 “mind	 rules	 matter;”	 which	 means	 mostly	 that	 the
individual	rules	the	generic	or	collective,	especially	when	we	refer	to	“mind”	as
“Universal	 Mind,’	 which	 is	 merely	 the	 operative	 wholeness	 of	 the	 “Greater
Individual”	 emerging	 slowly	 out	 of	 the	 planetary	 evolutionary	 process	 as	 a

“Greater	Person,”—the	God-of-the-end	of	the	planetary	cycle.

Astrology,	 as	 we	 understand	 it,	 complements	 modern	 science,	 insofar	 as	 it
deals	essentially	with	the	individual	super-structure	rather	than	with	the	generic-
collective	 under-structure.	 Through	 the	 study	 of	 the	 “first	 moment”	 of	 the	 life-
cycle	it	reaches	individual	being	and	individual	form;	and	because	it	does	so	it	is
able	 also	 to	 unveil	 the	 mystery	 of	 significance,	 which	 is	 a	 purely	 individual
factor.	 What	 it	 is	 able	 to	 grasp	 of	 the	 life-process	 of	 becoming	 itself,	 is
principally	 in	 terms	 of	 structural	 periods	 of	 destiny	 rather	 than	 in	 terms	 of	 set
concrete	events.	Nay	more,	astrology	can	only	really	know	the	way	this	process
of	 becoming	 appears	 to	 the	 individual	 being.	 It	 does	 not	 know	 events	 in
themselves	 so	 much	 as	 crises	 in	 the	 curve	 of	 an	 individual	 destiny.	 In	 other
words,	by	this	knowledge	of	form	it	reveals	the	individual	to	the	individuating;
and	 leads	 the	 individuating	 to	 a	 perception	 of	 the	 individual	 significance	 of
individuation	as	a	process.

This	 is	 what	 “life-interpretation”	 means.	 It	 is	 the	 perception	 of	 individual
form	and	of	individual	significance	by	an	evolving	or	individuating	personality.
This	personality	is	a	composite,	an	aggregation	of	factors	and	elements.	As	these
become	 harmonized	 by	 such	 a	 “life-interpretation,”	 revealing	 their	 potential
individual	 form	 and	 significance,	 the	 fulfilled	 and	 integrated	 Living	 Person
emerges.	Again	let	us	repeat	that	it	is	the	emergence	of	this	Living	Person	which
constitutes	 the	 goal	 of	 astrology—or	 at	 least	 of	 that	 astrology	 which	 we	 called
“Harmonic	Astrology.”	Some	further	facts	related	to	such	an	emergence	will	be
discussed	in	the	following	“Epilogue.”

### Temple	Astrology	(Lesson	XXV):

“What	 is	 here	 brought	 out	 is	 the	 existence	 of	 astrological	 domains,	 or	 boundaries	 of	 character	 which
might	be	described	as	race	character	limits	in	and	through	which	individual	character	is	to	be	defined.	Aries
must	always	have	some	of	the	extension	of	Mars,	and	Pisces	always	some	of	the	expansion	of	Jupiter,	not
through	any	necessity	of	astrology	or	the	celestial	scheme,	but	because	the	race	has	established	itself	in	this
fashion.	The	dignities	of	the	planets	involving	a	permanent	relationship	with	the	signs	(for	a	25,000-year
cycle	at	least)	are	known	as	essential	dignities,	and	when	the	planets	are	placed	in	positions	of	strength	or
weakness	 in	 terms	 of	 dignity	 the	 native	 is	 shown	 as	 tending	 towards	 or	 away	 from	 the	 racial	 norm	 upon

which	his	well-being	and	proper	growth	is	largely	dependent.	This	modifies	the	interpretation	of	the	known
facts	 of	 his	 life	 as	 these	 are	 bent	 upon	 the	 problem	 of	 his	 horoscope,	 but	 of	 course	 the	 actual	 planetary
significations	remain	absolute,	with	or	without	dignity.”

*	 A	 planet	 “disposes”	 of	 any	 other	 which	 may	 be	 found	 in	 the	 sign	 which	 it	 rules	 or	 in	 which	 it	 is
exalted.	In	Mussolini’s	chart	the	Sun	is	in	its	own	“house”	Leo	and	disposes	of	Mercury,	also	in	Leo.	But
Mercury	“disposes”	of	Pluto,	Saturn,	Moon	and	Mars	in	Gemini	(ruled	by	Mercury)	and	of	Uranus	in	Virgo
(also	 ruled	 by	 Mercury).	 Then	 the	 Moon	 disposes	 of	 Jupiter	 and	 Venus	 which	 are	 in	 Cancer;	 and	 Venus
disposes	of	Neptune	in	Taurus.	Thus	directly	or	indirectly	the	Sun	is	seen	to	dispose	of	all	planets	in	the
chart.	It	is	co-ruler	with	Mars,	ruler	of	the	Ascendant.

## EPILOGUE

## THE	USE	OF	ASTROLOGY	IN	THE	PROCESSES	OF
## INDIVIDUATION	AND	CIVILIZATION

We	hope	that,	throughout	the	whole	of	our	discussion	and	reformulation	of	the
philosophy,	 the	 symbolism	 and	 the	 technique	 of	 astrology,	 one	 thing	 has	 been
made	 to	 stand	 out	 in	 clear	 relief:	 The	 fact	 that	 the	 validity	 and	 power	 of
astrology	 depend	 primarily	 on	 the	 manner	 in	 which	 it	 is	 made	 to	 serve	 the
universal	goal	of	“more	wholeness”—the	goal	of	individuation	for	the	particular
man,	and	the	goal	of	Living	Civilization	for	humanity	as	a	whole.	As	a	system	of
coherent	 symbolism,	 astrology	 is	 a	 most	 fascinating	 intellectual	 study;	 as	 a
system	of	divination,	it	is	a	remarkable	tool	for	scrutinizing	the	fringe	of	future
events;	 as	 an	 historical	 phenomenon	 it	 is	 unique	 in	 allowing	 us	 to	 fathom	 the
mentality	of	more	or	less	distant	cultures—in	space	as	well	as	in	time.	And	yet,
unless	astrology	is	put	to	use	as	a	revealer	of	vital	significances	and	of	patterns
of	organic	(or	generally,	holistic)	relationships,	as	a	means	of	probing	the	secret
formulas	of	all	beginnings	with	the	view	to	leading	us	to	a	better	consummation
—in	other	words,	as	a	technique	of	personality-integration—it	remains	a	merely
intellectual	 speculation	 (as	 would	 be	 an	 algebra	 which	 could	 not	 be	 applied	 to
any	group	of	empirical	data)—or	else	a	dangerous	game	of	fortune-telling.

In	many	ways	and	in	many	places	we	have	expressed	this	view.	On	the	basis
of	it	we	have	stressed	the	connection	between	astrology	and	psychology—and,
had	 we	 had	 the	 space	 for	 it,	 we	 might	 have	 discussed	 the	 relations	 between
astrology	and	all	the	arts	of	physical	healing;	or	else	we	could	have	studied	the
place	 which	 astrology	might	occupy	in	other	arts,	which	all	together	constitute
the	 foundation	 of	 “culture”—from	 agriculture	 to	 the	 fine	 arts.	 We	 say	 here
purposely	 “arts”	 and	 not	 “sciences.”	 For	 applied	 astrology,	 being	 an	 art	 of
interpretation	 based	 upon:	 1)	 scientific	 data;	 2)	 a	 logic	 of	 symbolism—it	 deals
essentially	with	the	artistic	approach	to	life,	rather	than	with	the	scientific.	There
is	no	real	“science”	of	living.	Medicine,	for	instance,	is	not	a	science,	properly
speaking,	but	an	art	based	on	the	interpretation	of	data	scientifically	determined.

Analytical	psychology	is	not	a	science,	but	an	art	of	interpretation	of	empirical
facts	 scientifically	 collected	 and	 analyzed.	 The	 term	 “science”	 should	 be
reserved	 for	 so-called	 “exact	 sciences,”	 such	 as	 physics,	 mechanics	 and
astronomy,	on	one	hand,	and	on	the	other,	for	“abstract	sciences,”	such	as	logic
and	mathematics.	Every	applied	science	becomes	an	art	whenever	the	element	of
individual	interpretation	enters	in.	The	more	predominant	it	is,	the	more	truly	it
is	an	art—an	interpretative	art.

Be	this	as	it	may,	the	fact	is	that	astrology,	as	we	have	studied	it	in	the	second
part	of	this	book,	is	essentially	related	to	psychology,	and	its	main	purpose	is	to
contribute	 to	 the	 successful	 completion	 of	 the	 Great	 Work	 of	 man—that	 by
which	man	reaches	fulfillment	and	operative	wholeness,	and	as	a	result	becomes
an	organic	function	or	cell	within	a	greater	Whole—the	“Greater	Individual”	or
the	 “Planetary	 Individual,”	 or	 the	 Seed-Manu,	 or	 the	 Logos,	 or	 God—as	 one
may	 wish	 to	 name	 this	 next	 greater	 Whole	 of	 which	 the	 spiritually	 perfected
human	 personality	 becomes	 a	 part.	 In	 this	 concluding	 section	 we	 shall	 define,
more	 completely	 than	 before,	 the	 relation	 between	 astrology	 and	 psychology,
especially	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 complementary	 manner	 in	 which	 both	 may	 serve
toward	 the	 above-defined	 goal.	 Then	 we	 shall	 outline	 more	 specifically
astrology’s	 contribution	 to	 the	 achievement	 of	 that	 goal:	 1)	 for	 the	 human
personality	 treading	 the	 path	 to	 individuation;	 2)	 in	 reference	 to	 the	 new
civilization	in	the	making,	and	to	the	process	of	group-formation	which	is	to	play
so	important	a	part	in	it.

### The	Astrological	and	Psychological	Viewpoints	Correlated

We	 refer	 the	 reader,	 first	 of	 all,	 to	 the	 chapter:	 “Individual,	 Collective,
Creative,”	 etc.,	 in	 which	 the	 basis	 for	 a	 correlation	 between	 astrology	 and
analytical	psychology	is	established;	also	to	the	preceding	chapter	in	which	the
basic	 elements	 of	 Jung’s	 psychology	 are	 briefly	 stated.	 In	 the	 former	 we
produced	a	formula	which	defines	the	various	phases	of	any	and	all	life-cycles,
and	we	isolated	the	three	basic	terms	of	the	Cycle:	beginning,	middle	and	end,
corresponding	 to	 the	 One-that-is-in-the-beginning—the	 process	 of	 becoming—
the	seed-synthesis	(Cf.	especially	page	131	“Summing	up”).	Without	attempting
to	repeat	our	statements,	we	shall	now	say	that	the	main	difference	between	the
astrological	 and	 the	 psychological	 approaches	 is	 that	 while	 the	 latter	 sees
nothing	 but	 the	 “process	 of	 becoming	 whole”	 as	 it	 unfolds	 in	 Bergsonian
duration	through	myriads	of	transformations,	the	former	claims	that	the	ultimate
wholeness	 reached	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 process	 is	 already	 there	 at	 the	 very

beginning	of	the	process,	but	only	as	an	abstract	ideal	and	a	mere	potentiality.

If	 we	 refer	 to	 the	 trinity	 of	 elements	 which	 we	 then	 defined	 (Cf.	 p.	 117)—
quality,	 structure	 and	substance—we	 shall	 realize	 that	 quality	 or	 monad	 at	 the
beginning	 relates	 to,	 or	 is	 projected	 into,	 substantial	 elements	 which	 slowly
organize	 themselves	 as	 organic	 bodies	 through	 an	 evolutionary	 process.	 This
process	lasts	throughout	the	cycle	and	ends,	if	successful,	in	the	perfecting	of	a
body	(at	the	physiological	level)	and	a	Soul	(at	the	psycho-mental	level)	which
are	 the	 very	 exteriorization	 and	 manifestation	 of	 the	 initial	 monad,	 now
operating	as	the	Self.	Thus	the	beginning	and	the	end	are	identical	as	far	as	the
quality	is	concerned;	but	in	the	end	this	quality	is	fully	manifest	in	a	substantial
body,	while	in	the	beginning	it	is	only	an	abstract	potentiality.

From	the	point	of	view	of	spirit	(unity),	the	purpose	of	the	process	is	to	give
to	the	monad	a	new	creative	experience	and	to	fulfill	relationships	unfulfilled	in
the	past	cycle	or	cycles.	From	the	point	of	view	of	substance	(multiplicity),	the
purpose	 of	 the	 process	 is	 to	 organize	 the	 many	 elements	 that	 constituted	 the
residua	of	past	cycles	into	a	perfect	body	built	in	the	likeness	of	God-the-monad.
From	the	point	of	view	of	structure,	or	form,	or	mind,	the	process	is	an	esthetical
experience	of	beauty	and	rhythm.

Analytical	psychology	takes	the	point	of	view	of	substance,	as	all	empirical
sciences	 do.	 It	 deals	 with	 the	 ever-changing	 process	 of	 relationship	 between
individual	and	collective.	All	psychological	conflicts,	repressions,	sublimations
and	 assimilations	 are	 results	 of	 the	 working	 out	 of	 this	 process;	 all	 evolution
likewise.	 But	 the	 initial	 quality,	 which	 antedates	 the	 process,	 does	 not
fundamentally	 change.	 The	 individual	 structure	 exteriorizing	 this	 quality	 does
not	change	during	the	span	of	the	cycle.	The	wholeness	of	the	end	is	latent	in	the
monad	 of	 the	 beginning.	 It	 is	 not	 only	 latent.	 It	 actually	 is	 at	 work	 within	 the
very	heart	of	the	process	as	the	central	power	of	individuation.	The	energy	of	the
One	operates	at	the	core	of	every	one	of	the	Many	issued	from	this	One	—even
though	 the	 Many	 know	 it	 not.	 Thus,	 in	 a	 definite	 sense,	 the	 wholeness	 of	 the
future	 whole	 is	 acting	 upon	 the	 progressive	 building	 of	 this	 whole.	 Past	 and
Future	as	one	operate	within	the	present.	The	finished	end	of	the	process	is	latent
in	the	beginning;	but	only	provided	the	process	is	successful.	And	no	one	can	tell
whether	or	not	it	will	be	successful	in	a	particular	cycle.

The	 last	 statements	 have	 an	 essential	 bearing	 on	 the	 nature	 and	 value	 of
astrology.	More	than	that,	they	are	the	key	to	a	reconciliation	of	the	old	enemies:
free	will	and	determinism.	They	are	implied	in	the	philosophy	of	Time	which	we

sketched	out	in	the	first	part	of	this	work.

We	wrote	that	every	monad	is	the	creative	projection	of	a	moment,	the	initial
moment	of	this	monad’s	cycle.	The	potency	of	the	moment	exteriorizes	itself	in
the	 monads	 which	 at	 that	 very	 moment	 begin	 their	 individual	 cycles	 of
becoming.	 It	 is	 as	 if	 Time	 held	 a	 bag	 of	 seeds,	 from	 which	 at	 every	 moment
seeds	 would	 drop	 which	 would	 be	 formed	 in	 the	 likeness	 of	 the	 nature	 of	 that
moment.	Each	seed	is	a	dynamic	and	structural	potentiality	of	being.	Each	drops,
as	 an	 individual	 unit	 (monad),	 into	 the	 soil	 of	 the	 collective;	 just	 as	 moments
drop	into	the	past.	All	these	seeds	are	acted	upon	by	a	multitude	of	influences,
which	either	help	or	hinder	the	process	of	their	development	from	potentiality	to
actuality,	from	seed	to	fulfilled	and	blossoming	plant.

Myriads	 of	 seeds	 never	 develop.	 Myriads	 of	 seeds	 begin	 to	 develop	 whose
growth	 is	 stunted,	 thwarted	 or	 ended	 by	 the	 unsuccessful	 working	 out	 of	 the
relation	between	their	individual	selfhood	and	the	collective.	That	is	to	say,	the
personalities	 are	 stunted,	 thwarted	 or	 destroyed.	 In	 the	 personality	 there	 is	 a
certain	 amount	 of	 free	 will,	 insofar	 as	 the	 monad	 (which	 is	 pure,	 free	 and
spontaneous	creative	activity)	is	active—that	is,	insofar	as	the	individual	factor
dominates	the	collective.

If	the	seed	develops	into	a	complete	plant,	then	there	is	no	way	for	the	plant
to	 be	 anything	 else	 in	 actuality	 save	 what	 the	 seed	 was	 in	 potentiality—even
though	the	plant	may	be	either	more	or	less	sturdy	and	perfect	in	its	proportions.
There	 is	 no	 outside	 agency	 or	 God	 to	 determine	 beforehand:	 1)	 whether	 there
will	actually	be	a	full-grown	plant;	2)	how	perfect	this	full-grown	plant	will	be,
if	it	is	at	all.	But	the	seed	determines	the	organic	structure	and	characteristics	of
the	finished	plant.

The	 acorn	 is	 not	 free	 to	 become	 an	 apple	 tree;	 and	 the	 seed	 of	 the	 oak	 is
absolutely	certain	to	be	an	acorn.	But	no	one	can	tell	whether	a	particular	acorn
will	 become	 an	 oak.	 It	 may	 not	 even	 matter.	 What	 seems	 to	 matter	 is	 that	 a
certain	 number	 of	 acorns	 will	 keep	 the	 oak	 species	 manifest,	 perhaps	 in	 a
definite	numerical	strength.	Likewise	prophetic	books,	for	instance,	are	wont	to
say	that	one-third	of	the	men	will	be	saved,	two-thirds	lost.	It	does	not	seem	to
matter	who	in	particular	will	be	saved	or	lost-—at	least	not	to	the	whole	of	the
species.	It	matters	very	much,	of	course,	to	the	individual	who	is	free	to	choose
—free	to	choose	whether	he	will	become	what	he	is	potentially,	or	will	not.	No
one	is	ever	free	to	become	successfully	what	one	is	not	To	become	what	one	is
not	always	means	to	fail	to	be	at	all.	Either	fulfillment	of	potentialities	or	failure

is	 inherent	 in	 the	 monad	 (therefore	 in	 the	 birth-moment).	 These	 potentialities
inherent	in	the	monad	and	in	the	birth-moment	can	be	found	symbolized	in	the
birth-chart.

Most	people	have	an	“individualistic”	but	not	an	“individuated”	conception
of	 “freedom.”*	 Freedom	 is	 the	 inherent	 capacity	 of	 fulfilling	 the	 potential
characteristics	of	one’s	individual	selfhood.	It	is	not	the	power	to	do	what	it	may
please	 one	 to	 do.	 For	 “pleasing”	 here	 refers	 merely	 to	 the	 ego	 at	 its	 stage	 of
rebellion	against	any	 life-contents.	Such	rebellion	means	often	the	 desire	to	do
the	 most	 silly,	 meaningless	 things.	 This	 is	 not	 freedom,	 but	 the	 result	 of	 that
phase	of	“individualization”	which	is	purely	negative	and	separative.	“I	shall	not
have	anything	to	do	with	collective	values,”	says	the	budding	individual.	But	the
mature	 individual	 says,	 on	 the	 other	 hand:	 “I	 shall	 bring	 the	 collective	 to	 the
focalization	of	my	own	selfhood,	and	give	it	my	own	significance.”

The	 birth-chart	 of	 an	 individual	 is	 the	 symbol	 of	 his	 freedom,	 because	 it	 is
the	symbol	 of	what	he	is.	The	 more	 free	 an	 individual,	 the	 more	 perfectly	 and
sharply	(sharp,	as	to	outlines)	he	is	what	he	is,	the	more	clear-cut	the	form	of	his
individual	selfhood,	and	thus	of	his	behavior.	The	collective	always	tends	to	blur
the	outlines	of	any	individual	selfhood.	Therefore	it	works	against	the	freedom
of	the	individual	unless	the	individual	can	“assimilate”	the	collective	contents	of
his	surroundings	and	his	ancestry—that	is,	unless	he	can	make	them	“similar	to”
what	he,	essentially	and	archetypally,	is:	a	tremendous	task	in	our	Dark	Ages,	or
as	 the	 Hindu	 has	 it,	 Kali	 Yuga;	 a	 task	 the	 nature	 and	 magnitude	 of	 which	 are
hardly	ever	recognized,	yet	which	conditions	the	entire	spiritual	development	of
the	personality	and	the	success	of	the	individual	in	being	at	the	same	time	true	to
his	structural	pattern	of	selfhood	and	rich	with	living	contents—all	of	which	had
to	be	assimilated.

These	 considerations	 determine	 the	 scope	 of	 astrology.	 The	 birth-chart
reveals	the	potential	structure	of	the	monad;	that	is	the	purely	individual	element
in	 the	 native;	 hence	 the	 element	 of	 freedom	 and	 significance,	 which	 is	 the
spiritual	 endowment	 of	 every	 human	 being.	 But	 the	 birth-chart	 will	 not	 tell
whether	 this	 potentiality	 will	 ever	 become	 an	 actuality,	 whether	 or	 not	 the
process	 of	 individuation	 will	 be	 successful.	 Nevertheless,	 as	 we	 have	 already
written	 in	 the	 chapters	 on	 “Progressions,”	 the	 birth-chart	 will	 tell	 what	 will	 be
the	form	and	quality	of	the	Soul,	if	it	comes	to	be;	also	what	will	be	the	general
cycles	of	unfoldment	of	the	personality	and	its	crises	of	growth.	But	it	can	never
tell,	from	purely	astrological	factors,	and	barring	the	use	of	prophetic	faculties,

whether	the	crises	will	be	successfully	met,	and	if	they	are	met,	what	will	be	the
psychic	residua	accumulating	in	the	personal	unconscious	as	a	result	of	the	stress
and	strain.

What	 astrology	 cannot	 tell	 on	 purely	 astrological	 grounds	 analytical
psychology	 can	 often	 infer	 from	 the	 data	 it	 investigates.	 The	 analyst	 deals
directly	 with	 the	 personality,	 as	 it	 becomes	 and	 has	 become.	 And	 if	 the
personality	has	reached	a	certain	age,	and	if	its	individual	selfhood	has	been	little
active,	the	analyst	can	quite	accurately	deduce	what	the	rest	of	the	life	will	be.
The	astrologer	could	tell	the	analyst	when	the	next	crises	will	come;	but	cannot
tell	 him,	 from	 the	 birth-chart	 and	 progressions	 only,	 how	 the	 personality	 will
meet	 these	 crises.	 The	 analyst	 cannot	 say	 when	 the	 crises	 will	 come,	 but	 can
surmise	how	the	personality	will	meet	certain	inevitable	crises.	In	other	words,
the	 astrologer	 and	 the	 analyst	 look	 at	 two	 different	 aspects	 of	 the	 total	 human
being.	Their	points	of	view	complete	each	other.	And	they	complete	each	other	in
the	 same	 way	 in	 which	 empirical	 science	 and	 religion	 (or	 occultism)	 complete
each	other.

Such	a	statement	does	not	invalidate	the	conclusions	of	earlier	chapters	as	to
the	 analogy	 existing	 between	 the	 relation	 of	 mathematics	 to	 physics,	 and	 the
relation	of	astrology	to	analytical	psychology.	Both	mathematics	(or	logic)	and
astrology	 deal	 with	 “pure	 form,”	 which	 exists	 only	 “in	 the	 beginning”	 as	 the
abstract	 structure	 exteriorizing	 the	 quality-monad	 which	 is	 the	 nucleus	 of	 the
future	 life-process.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 physics	 and	 analytical	 psychology	 deal
with	 the	 realm	 of	 phenomena	 and	 becoming,	 with	 the	 constantly	 changing
formations	 of	 the	 life-process.	 Abstract	 “form”	 does	 not	 become;	 but
evolutionary	“formations”	and	bodies	do	constantly	change—and	thus,	from	the
point	of	view	of	spirit	(Hindu	philosophy),	they	are	the	result	of	the	deterioration
of	 primordial	 being	 and	 truth—thus	 they	 are	 false	 and	 illusory.	 But	 from	 the
point	 of	 view	 of	 substance,	 “abstract	 form”	 is	 merely	 an	 intellectual	 idea,	 a
product	 of	 the	 will	 to	 stability	 and	 preservation	 which	 is	 inherent	 in	 man	 and
which	 leads	 so	 often	 to	 a	 shrinking	 from	 reality.	 Reality,	 for	 substance,	 is	 the
changing	 world-process.	 But	 reality,	 for	 spirit,	 is	 the	 changeless	 (changeless
insofar	as	the	whole	cycle	is	concerned)	monadic	structure.

This	 duality	 of	 point	 of	 view	 is	 an	 expression	 of	 the	 eternal	 ineradicable
dualism	of	all	living.	In	Psychological	Types,	C.	G.	Jung	studies	critically	many
aspects	 of	 this	 basic	 dualism—as	 for	 instance	 realism	 and	 nominalism	 in
medieval	 philosophy.	 He	 points	 out	 that	 they	 are	 two	 basically	 irreconcilable
attitudes	 which	 are	 the	 outcome	 of	 two	 fundamental	 psychological	 types:

introvert	and	extravert.

In	 other	 words,	 he	 attempts	 to	 effect	 a	 kind	 of	 reconciliation	 between
opposites	 of	 thought	 by	 referring	 them	 to	 differences	 in	 psychological	 types.
Then	 he	 tries	 to	 show	 how	 the	 basic	 impulses	 motivating	 each	 type	 can	 be
integrated	 within	 the	 personality	 through	 the	 operation	 of	 a	 “transcendent
function,”	 through	 “creative	 phantasy.”	 This	 fits	 in	 well	 with	 our	 trinity	 of
individual,	 collective,	 creative.	 The	 introvert	 is	 a	 personality	 in	 whom	 the
balance	 of	 forces	 shows	 an	 emphasis	 upon	 the	 process	 of	 individuation.	 The
extravert	is	a	personality	in	whom	collectivation	is	the	dominant	process.	But	in
the	true	“creative	act”	individual	and	collective	join	hands.	The	collective	ideas
of	the	past	become	focalized	and	individuated	within	the	psycho-mental	womb
of	 the	 creator,	 and	 at	 the	 same	 time	 are	 released	 creatively	 as	 new	 collective
elements,	 as	 the	 “stuff	 of	 civilization,”	 thus	 becoming	 eventually	 the	 very
substance	 of	 the	 ultimate	 synthesis	 of	 Man-the-whole.	 In	 the	 introvert,	 life
operates	inward;	in	the	extravert,	outward.	But	in	the	creator,	it	operates	“in	and
through.”	The	creator,	at	his	highest,	is	what	Hindu	wisdom	names	an	“avatar.”
The	avatar	is	not	only	the	“hypostasis”	of	a	“greater	Individual.”	It	is	the	answer
to	a	collective	need;	it	is	the	answer,	through	an	individual,	to	a	collective	need
which	 the	 individual	 focalized	 within	 himself—a	 need,	 by	 fulfilling	 which,	 he
overcame.

Speaking,	now,	strictly	in	terms	of	practical	method,	we	claim	that	astrology
could	 be	 most	 helpful	 to	 the	 psychoanalyst,	 to	 the	 psychiatrist,	 and	 as	 well,	 of
course,	to	the	educator,	who,	if	successful,	must	be,	first	of	all—intuitively	if	not
intellectually—a	psychologist.	It	would	give	them	something	objective	to	depend
upon,	 and	 with	 which	 to	 check	 upon	 subjective	 data,	 such	 as	 dreams	 and	 the
details	 of	 a	 person’s	 life-story.	 It	 would	 coordinate	 all	 these	 subjective	 data	 in
terms	 of	 structural	 tendencies	 of	 the	 psyche;	 tendencies,	 the	 cycle	 of
manifestation	 of	 which	 would	 become	 objectively	 apparent,	 with	 their	 waxing
and	waning	movements	and	their	critical	moments.	It	is	true	that	foreknowledge
of	 psychological	 or	 physiological	 crises	 may	 be	 very	 dangerous	 and
disintegrating	 to	 the	 person	 in	 whom	 they	 are	 to	 occur-—dangerous	 in
proportion	as	he	is	not	an	individual,	and	therefore	is	neither	free	nor	creative	of
meanings;	but	it	would	be	of	vast	significance	to	the	analyst	or	“life-counsellor”
who,	in	this	century,	is	taking	the	place	of	priest-confessor	or	guru.	Even	if	such
“guides”	 are	 to	 be	 endowed	 a	 priori	 with	 a	 keen	 intuition—if	 they	 be	 true
“guides”!—yet	 the	 birth-chart	 and	 progressions	 of	 those	 they	 attempt	 to	 lead
toward	fulfillment	would	in	most	cases	be	invaluable	adjuncts	to	and	checks	on

their	intuitive	perceptions.

This	may	be	even	more	obvious	in	the	case	of	the	“child-psychologist;”	for
here	there	are	practically	no	subjective	data	to	go	by,	except	those	given	by	the
parents.	The	charts	of	the	parents,	when	correlated	with	that	of	the	child,	would
reveal	matters	that	only	a	thorough	“analysis”	of	the	parents	would	uncover.	We
shall	 again	 discuss	 this	 matter	 of	 correlations	 between	 two	 or	 more	 individual
charts;	 but	 we	 can	 see	 at	 once	 how	 conjugal	 problems	 could	 be	 solved	 much
more	easily	if	the	psychologist	could	compare	the	charts	of	husband	and	wife.	In
many	 cases,	 the	 knowledge	 obtained	 by	 the	 psychologist	 through	 astrological
means—and	 generally	 speaking	 by	 any	 type	 of	 “healer”—would	 not	 be
discussed	as	such	with	the	patient;	but	it	would	add	a	new	dimension,	as	it	were,
to	the	understanding	which	the	analyst	gains	of	his	patient.	In	other	cases,	with
patients	convinced	of	the	validity	of	astrology,	reference	to	definite	astrological
factors	would	probably	“bring	a	point	home”	in	a	more	impressive	way	than	do
the	usual	suggestions.

In	such	cases,	however,	it	should	be	clear	that	whenever	a	person	feels	that
planets	are	entities	that	influence	him	and	cause	things	to	happen,	good	or	bad,
—such	 a	 person	 is	 psychologically	 hurt	 by	 such	 a	 belief.	 The	 same	 injury,
psychologically	 speaking,	 would	 be	 caused	 were	 the	 person	 to	 believe	 that	 a
“black	magician”	is	pursuing	him	or	her,	or	that	a	“white	brother”	is	providing
him	with	soul-salvation	or	other	boons	of	one	type	or	another.	All	such	beliefs	in
outside	 powers	 influencing,	 or	 (as	 is	 usually	 the	 case)	 compelling,	 the
personality	in	this	or	that	manner	constitute	deteriorations	of	individual	selfhood;
they	 lead	 to	 psychological	 slavery	 through	 fear	 or	 through	 transference	 of	 the
power	of	initiative,	or	colloquially	speaking,	through	“passing	the	buck”	to	some
entity	outside	of	the	self.

If	 Mars	 as	 a	 tangible	 planet	 is	 influencing	 or	 compelling	 you	 to	 be	 angry,
what	is	there	you	can	do	about	it?	Can	you	fight	a	planet?	Can	you	hide	from	it?
Perhaps	you	will	do	as	did	a	Brahmin	who	thought	of	escaping	a	death-dealing
planetary	 aspect	 by	 remaining	 immersed	 under	 water	 during	 the	 exact	 moment
of	 the	 aspect’s	 maturation,	 because	 water	 is	 supposed	 to	 insulate	 from	 certain
planetary	 magnetic	 influences—and	 was	 drowned	 in	 the	 process.	 Perhaps	 you
will	try	to	“buy”	protection	from	some	spiritual	agency,	church	or	what-not.	And
all	 the	 time	 the	 fear	 will	 be	 there,	 working	 in	 you	 subconsciously,	 if	 not
consciously-causing	 the	 very	 things	 that	 are	 feared.	 The	 more	 a	 baneful
astrological	factor	is	made	into	a	definite	entity,	the	greater	will	be	the	fear	of	it.
For	there	may	seem	to	be	no	recourse	against	such	an	entity—even	though	one

might	repeat	a	hundred	times:	“The	wise	man	rules	his	stars!”	Can	you	“rule”	a
tornado	or	an	earthquake?	Can	you	forbid	an	eclipse	to	occur	on	your	birthday?
Can	you	“rule”	cosmic	emanations,	waves	and	the	like,	that	sweep	from	the	Sun
and	 “hit”	 this	 or	 that	 sensitive	 center	 in	 your	 charts—if	 those	 are	 actual,
concrete,	measurable	forces?

There	 is	 indeed	 no	 logic	 in	 the	 concept—unless	 it	 be	 taken	 to	 mean	 what
Paracelsus	said	it	meant	in	an	excerpt	quoted	in	our	 first	chapter	(p.	26):	“The
stars	force	nothing	into	us	that	we	are	not	willing	to	take	.	.	.	They	are	free	for
themselves	and	we	are	free	for	ourselves	.	.	.”	In	that	sense,	what	is	established
by	astrology	is	merely	a	holistic	correspondence	and	a	synchronistic	relation	of
process	between	macrocosm	and	microcosm,	between	the	universal	Person	that
some	call	“God”	and	the	particular	personality	that	is	man.	The	life-process,	in
other	words,	runs	through	the	universal	at	the	same	time	as	it	does	through	the
myriads	 of	 particulars.	 Both	 are	 geared,	 as	 it	 were,	 to	 the	 creative	 moment,	 of
which	 the	 spirit	 in	 man	 is	 the	 very	 expression.	 The	 moment	 operates	 through
man’s	 monad	 and	 through	 man’s	 essential	 archetypal	 structure	 (which	 is	 his
karma).	That	moment	 contains	in	 potency	 the	 whole	 of	 the	 celestial	 pattern	 of
planetary	and	spatial	relationships.	When	we	read	the	“chart	of	the	Heavens”	we
merely	 read	 the	 symbolic	 structure	 of	 the	 moment—and	 therefore	 of	 our	 own
spirit,	if	the	moment	considered	happens	to	be	our	first	moment	of	independent
existence,	 i.e.,	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 cycle	 of	 our	 individual	 selfhood	 as	 an
organism	integrating	Earth-materials.

In	other	words,	what	“influences”	us	is	only	the	moment,	and	above	all	our
first	 moment	 of	 selfhood.	 We	 can	 read	 the	 characteristics	 of	 this	 moment	 by
interpreting	the	pattern	constituted	by	the	celestial	bodies	surrounding	the	place
of	 our	 birth;	 this	 pattern	 represents	 the	 visible	 structural	 projection	 of	 the
universal	Whole,	insofar	as	this	 Whole—of	which	we	are	a	part—concerns	us.
But	 no	 material	 celestial	 body	 affects	 us	 as	 an	 individual.	 What	 acts	 upon	 our
personality—body	and	psyche—is	 the	creative	power	of	the	moment.	And	this
creative	power	of	the	moment	of	birth	is	our	very	monad.

Of	course	there	are	myriads	of	moments	that	follow	for	us	this	first	moment
of	selfhood.	Such	moments	are	parts	of	our	“life-process”	of	development,	and
must	 be	 differentiated	 from	 the	 birth-moment	 which	 is	 our	 individual	 monad;
and	also	from	the	death-moment	which	is	a	recapitulation	and	a	synthesis.	They
add	 contents	 to	 our	 personality;	 but	 they	 do	 not	 basically	 alter	 the	 archetypal
structure	of	our	individual	selfhood.

These	 moments	 of	 the	 life-process	 are	 symbolized	 in	 astrology	 by	 the
transits.	And	transits	do	not	affect	the	structure	of	our	individual	selfhood;	they
symbolize	 the	 power	 which	 every	 successive	 moment	 of	 the	 life-process	 after
our	 birth	 has	 to	 modify	 the	 contents	 of	 our	 personality.	 Such	 a	 “power	 of
modification”	 is	 not	 fate!	 No	 more	 than	 is	 the	 fact	 that	 each	 season	 and
geographical	 location	 offers	 to	 you	 its	 own	 foodstuffs	 for	 eating	 and
assimilation.	Out	of	a	variety	of	foodstuffs	you	can	extract	by	digestion	the	same
basic	chemicals	which	your	body	needs	in	order	to	preserve	its	organic	structure
intact.	 True,	 some	 foods	 may	 fatten	 you,	 others	 cause	 you	 physiological	 ills—
and	 in	 that	 sense	 you,	 as	 a	 psycho-physiological	 organism,	 are	 affected	 by	 the
foodstuffs	which	season	and	geographical	location	provide.	But	if	your	organism
is	 originally	 healthy,	 it	 will	 have	 the	 power	 to	 maintain	 itself	 and	 to	 function
creatively	on	almost	any	kind	of	food	and	in	almost	any	kind	of	climate;	for	the
healthy	 organism	 can	 extract	 what	 it	 needs	 from	 the	 food	 provided,	 and	 if
necessary	 can	 transform	 what	 it	 gets	 to	 suit	 its	 organic	 purpose.	 For	 instance,
Arctic	 explorers	 have	 lived	 exclusively	 on	 animal	 food	 for	 over	 a	 year,	 their
organism	 transforming	 chemically	 the	 animal	 protein	 into	 chemicals	 which
normally	are	derived	from	starchy	foods.

The	same	applies	to	any	astrological	transit—because	it	applies	to	what	any
moment	 of	 our	 life,	 as	 it	 were,	 projects	 into	 our	 psycho-physiological
personality.	 Each	 moment	 provides	 us	 with	 “psychic	 foodstuffs”	 (or	 more
generally,	experiences),	the	nature	of	which	we	can	ascertain	from	a	study	of	the
pattern	 of	 celestial	 bodies	 at	 that	 moment.	 Some	 of	 them	 may	 “agree”	 with	 us
better	 than	 others.	 Some	 usually	 tend	 to	 cause	 indigestion;	 others,	 we	 seem
unable	to	assimilate	or	perhaps	even	to	ingest.	And	so	life	is	made	more	or	less
satisfying	to	our	personal	tastes.

Yet	 this	 does	 not	 mean	 fate;	 for	 in	 proportion	 as	 we	 are	 originally	 whole
(healthy),	 so	 shall	 we	 be	 able	 to	 extract	 from	 the	 food	 of	 every	 experience	 the
psychological	elements	which	we	need	in	order	to	complete	the	process	of	life-
fulfillment	and	individuation.	And	therefore,	to	that	extent,	we	are	unaffected	by
and	 free	 from	 the	 power	 of	 moments—and	 of	 their	 symbols,	 the	 stars.	 To	 the
extent	to	which	we	are	whole	as	“lesser	individuals”—to	that	extent	shall	we	be
unaffected	by	and	free	from	the	conditioning	imposed	upon	us	by	our	position	in
the	organism	of	the	“Greater	Individual”	of	whom	we	are	a	part.

But	what	if	we	are	not	whole	and	originally	healthy?	This	then	refers	to	our
monad	and	its	karma;	and	karma	is	nothing	more	mysterious	than	the	archetypal
structure	exteriorizing	the	particular	quality	of	this	monad,	which	quality	in	turn

is	an	expression	of	the	first	moment	of	individual	selfhood—the	One-that-is-in-
the-beginning.	This,	then,	is	our	“fatality”:	that	we	are	what	we	are.	Obviously,
the	term	fatality	in	this	sense	is	rather	meaningless.	Spiritually	speaking,	I	cannot
realize	 myself	as	what	I	am	not.	I	can,	of	course,	make	 intellectual	pictures	of
my	 personality	being	different	from	what	this	personality	actually	is.	But	I	am
making	these	pictures;	and	I	am	not	going	out	of	myself	by	making	them.	I	am
merely	 playing	 with	 colored	 phantasms,	 building	 castles
the	 air;
“compensating”	for	certain	psychological	conditions	which	are	integral	parts	of
what	I	am.	Therefore	the	“compensation,”	as	well	as	all	my	dreams,	are	integral
parts	of	what	I	am.	My	sense	of	being	oppressed	by	fate	is	part	of	what	I	am.	It	is
merely	 the	 reaction	 of	 some	 parts	 of	 my	 total	 being	 to	 other	 parts	 with	 which
they	are	in	discordant	or	dissonant	relation.

### in

In	 another	 sense,	 this	 is	 the	 same	 situation	 which	 Bergson	 discusses	 at	 the
end	 of	 his	 Creative	 Evolution,	 when	 he	 proves	 that	 we	 cannot	 really	 conceive
“chaos.”	Chaos	is	to	us	always	the	absence	of	a	particular	order,	and	a	type	of
order	 which	 compensates	 for	 all	 the	 types	 of	 order	 which	 we	 normally	 expect.
Likewise	 all	 the	 things	 “we	 should	 like	 to	 be”	 are	 merely	 reactions	 of	 certain
parts	of	our	total	being	to	other	parts	thereof;	and	these	reactions	themselves	are
thus	parts	of	our	total	being.

In	 other	 words,	 selfhood	 and	 destiny	 are	 two	 aspects	 of	 the	 same	 whole,
which,	to	use	modern	terms,	is	a	time-space	continuum	within	the	greater	time-
space	 continuum	 which	 is	 the	 universe.	 These	 two	 continua	 interact	 at	 every
point;	just	as	whole	and	parts	always	interact	at	every	point	of	the	organism.	If	a
# part	is	originally	weak,	it	will	tend	to	break	down	easily	under	the	pressure	of	the
demands	 made	 upon	 it	 by	 the	 whole.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 because	 of	 that,	 the
whole	will	tend	to	protect	more	carefully	that	part	which	is	the	weak	link	in	the
chain	 of	 its	 organic	 relationships,	 and	 is	 thus	 a	 dangerous	 point,	 an	 “Achilles’
heel.”	 Therefore,	 as	 already	 said,	 an	 “easy”	 birth-chart	 means	 little	 release	 of
power	from	the	greater	Whole	in	which	we	are	parts;	a	“difficult”	birth-chart,	a
great	 release	 of	 such	 spiritual	 power.	 The	 principle	 of	 compensatory	 action—
which	is	basic	in	the	consideration	of	any	organic	whole—is	here	exemplified.

The	sense	of	fate	is	thus	merely	the	reaction	of	a	part	of	the	whole	being	to	a
situation	which	involves	a	priori	this	very	sense	of	fate.	It	is	merely	a	sense	of
internal	pressure:	just	as	the	sense	of	freedom	is	a	sense	of	external	release.	It	is
an	organic	sense-usually	both	at	the	psychological	and	at	the	physiological	level,
but	at	times	with	an	emphasis	upon	one	or	other	of	them.	The	fact	remains	that—
I	am	what	I	am.	But,	let	us	not	forget,	this	I-am-ness	refers	to	the	form	of	self,

not	to	the	contents	of	personality.	This	form	may	be	so	universal	and	adaptable
that	it	may	give	room	to	a	vast	multiplicity	of	contents—so	that	the	personality
may	seem	truly	all-encompassing	and	all-understanding	in	its	universality.	But	a
form	it	must	be;	and	that	form	is	the	structural	conditioning	of	the	wholeness	that
is	the	fully	developed	I-am-ness.	That	form	is	the	exteriorization	of	the	quality
which	emanated	from	the	moment	which	was	the	initial	point	of	the	cycle	of	that
I-am.

Why,	then,	can	a	Christ-like	person	and	an	unprepossessing	human	being	be
born	at	the	same	moment—or	about	the	same	moment?	Because	in	the	first	case,
the	 structure	 of	 selfhood	 focalizes	 and	 releases	 universal	 energies	 from	 the
“Greater	 Individual;”	 whereas	 in	 the	 second	 case,	 such	 a	 structure	 is	 a	 heavy
armature,	 which	 does	 not	 allow	 any	 adaptation	 to	 universal	 conditioning,	 and
practically	 no	 assimilation	 of	 life-contents.	 There	 may	 be	 a	 relative	 identity	 of
structure	 (many	 scoundrels	 look	 just	 like	 Christs,	 as	 far	 as	 the	 structure	 of	 the
head	goes);	but	in	the	first	case	that	structure	is	filled	in	with	glorious	light;	in
the	 second	 case	 it	 is	 empty	 and	 burdened	 with	 its	 own	 weight.	 Can	 astrology
ever	 determine	 from	 a	 birth-chart	 whether	 the	 personality	 it	 symbolizes	 is
glowing	 with	 universal	 contents	 or	 is	 empty	 and	 dark?	 Astrology	 cannot.	 Any
more	 than	astrology	alone	and	unaided	 can	say	whether	a	given	chart	refers	to
the	birth	of	a	cow	or	of	a	human	being.

Astrology	 does	 not	 deal	 primarily	 with	 life-contents,	 but	 only	 with	 the
structure	 of	 individual	 selfhood.	 It	 is,	 strictly	 speaking,	 as	 formal	 a	 system	 of
knowledge	as	algebra.	Its	formulas	apply	to	any	contents—therefore	they	do	not
embody	 fate.	 For	 this	 reason,	 astrology	 needs	 psychological	 analysis,	 which
deals	 with	 empirically	 determined	 personal	 contents.	 Astrology	 is	 the	 male
element:	 that	 which	 gives	 the	 formula.	 Psychology	 is	 the	 female	 element:	 that
which	 gives	 the	 substantial	 contents.	 Thus	 they	 complement	 each	 other	 in	 the
determination	 of,	 and	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 serving	 the	 integration	 of,	 the	 whole
man:	the	Living	Person.

### Astrology	and	the	Process	of	Individuation

The	formulation	of	a	technique	by	means	of	which	astrology	could	serve	as
an	 essential	 factor	 in	 the	 process	 of	 individuation	 is	 outside	 the	 scope	 of	 this
book.	 It	 is	 even	 doubtful	 whether	 mankind	 at	 large	 is	 prepared	 to	 make	 a
constructive	use	of	such	a	potential	technique	of	integration.	As	in	the	case	of	all
so-called	 “esoteric”
techniques	 of	 spiritual	 development	 or	 personality
integration	 which	 are	 featured	 in	 Theosophical,	 or	 Rosicrucian	 or,	 in	 general,

“occult”	groups,	it	seems	necessary	for	those	who	would	use	such	a	technique	to
go	 about	 it	 in	 a	 steady	 and	 careful	 way,	 which	 requires	 some	 sort	 of	 personal
guidance,	 or	 at	 least	 someone	 to	 answer	 questions	 and	 to	 check	 up	 results—
physiological	 as	 well	 as	 psychological.	 This	 does	 not	 mean	 that	 techniques	 of
integration	 are	 mysterious	 or	 veiled	 in	 glamor.	 They	 are,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 very
matter-of-fact	procedures;	but	relatively	speaking,	they	are	forced	psychological
processes	depending,	for	the	most	part,	on	the	use	of	creative	imagination—and
they	may	as	easily	“go	wrong”	as	any	type	of	psychoanalysis.	Unless	those	who
attempt	them	are	either	already	integrated	in	their	very	depths,	or	are	ready	to	go
persistently	and	steadily	“all	the	way,”	it	would	be	much	better	that	they	did	not
begin	at	all.

This	is	quite	evident	even	where	the	mere	use	of	astrological	symbolism	and
the	 casual	 reading	 of	 birth-charts	 and	 progressions	 are	 concerned.	 A	 little
astrological	 knowledge	 is	 one	 of	 the	 worst	 things	 that	 can	 come	 to	 one	 who	 is
not	 altogether	 solidly	 established	 in	 his	 own	 selfhood.	 The	 usual	 beginner	 in
astrology	 often	 gets	 the	 queerest	 notions.	 He	 has	 not,	 as	 yet,	 digested	 the
fundamentals	 of	 astrology—how	 few	 people	 really	 have!—and	 he	 is	 handling
promiscuously,	at	home	and	in	the	company	of	his	friends,	psychological	acids
and	 explosives.	 That	 more	 harm	 is	 not	 done	 is	 due	 only	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 even
those	who	read	about	or	vaguely	study	astrology	do	not	usually	believe	in	it	in
any	vital	sense.	They	are	therefore	protected	by	their	relative	unbelief.

Any	 deliberate	 use	 of	 astrological	 symbols,	 and	 of	 one’s	 birth-chart	 and
progressions,	 for	 deep	 and	 vital	 purposes,	 would
involve	 even	 more
psychological	 danger.	 It	 should	 never	 be	 attempted	 unless	 one	 is	 thoroughly
grounded	 in	 and	 convinced	 of	 the	 validity	 of	 the	 attitude	 which	 we	 have
developed—much	 too	 briefly—in	 this	 book:	 the	 symbolical	 attitude.	 For	 this
reason	we	cannot	present	in	these	pages	a	very	coherent,	and	still	less	a	complete
picture	of	the	way	in	which	astrology	could	be	used	deliberately	as	a	technique
of	 individuation.	 However,	 various	 suggestions	 and	 leading	 points	 can	 be
offered;	and	the	following	excerpts	from	some	pamphlets	of	ours	on	Harmonic
Astrology	and	Harmonic	Psychology	may	prove	valuable:

“We	 live	 in	 a	 world	 of	 symbols.	 Every	 object	 that	 surrounds	 us,	 every
form	 of	 Intelligence,	 every	 soul,	 is	 a	 symbol.	 The	 Creative	 Principle
perpetually	produces	living	forms,	forms	which	are	truly	works	of	art,	which
are	 symbolic	 representations	 of	 one	 or	 the	 other	 of	 the	 infinitely	 varied
aspects	of	universal,	all-encompassing	Being.

“Contemporary	 psychology	 deals	 essentially	 with	 the	 interpretation	 of
symbols.	 It	 attempts	 to	 free	 the	 psyche	 of	 man	 from	 the	 depressing	 and
perverted
is,	 from	 wrong
the	 race	 subconscious,
interpretations	 of	 the	 essential	 symbols	 of	 human	 life—be	 it	 individual	 or
collective—created	by	the	past.

### images	 of

### that

“In	 order	 to	 release	 in	 every	 individual	 the	 capacity	 for	 the	 unhindered
interpretation	 of	 the	 symbols	 of	 his	 own	 living,	 in	 order	 therefore	 to	 give
back	to	man	the	freedom	to	interpret	life	spontaneously	in	terms	of	his	own
creative	 center	 of	 living,	 the	 new	 psychology	 reaches	 to	 dreams	 and	 other
symbolical	representations	of	the	unconscious;	for	in	those	may	be	found	the
striking	 images,	 the	 self-revealing	 pictures	 which	 will	 establish	 a	 contact
between	 the	 confused,	 inhibited	 personality	 and	 its	 creative	 source.	 As	 this
contact	occurs,	as	this	revelation	of	the	submerged	creative	activities	of	the
inner	 life-center	 stirs	 the	 soul	 into	 realizing	 its	 own	 god-like	 identity,	 a
process	 is	 started	 which	 burns	 up	 the	 refuse	 and	 the	 crystallizations	 of	 the
past,	 and	 which	 releases	 the	 creative	 energies	 of	 free	 selfhood.	 This	 is
liberation.

“Man’s	consciousness,	enslaved	by	fetishes	of	all	sorts,	can	be	liberated
only	by	the	power	perpetually	and	spontaneously	to	create	symbols,	and	thus
to	give	meaning	and	nobility	to	life.	This	is	the	secret	of	the	Art	of	Living.	It
is	 the	 foundation	 of	 true	 psychology.	 Only	 the	 creator	 is	 free;	 because	 he
alone	need	not	depend	upon	the	symbolism	of	the	past,	but	is	able	to	live	in
the	act	of	creating	ever	new	symbols.

“This	process	of	liberation	can	be	started	by	breaking	down	the	hypnosis
of	 the	 past	 and	 freeing	 the	 individual	 from	 his	 hypnotizer,	 the	 race’s
subconscious;	 or	 by	 revealing	 to	 him	 the	 all-compelling	 Image	 of	 his	 own
selfhood:	the	seed-Image	of	his	destiny.	The	first	method	can	be	pursued	by
the	use	of	music	and	vibrations	of	a	certain	character,	which	re-establish	the
circulation	 of	 the	 spiritual	 life-force	 by	 burning	 away	 obstructions,	 and	 so
bring	 back	 the	 tone	 of	 the	 psyche	 to	 its	 fundamental	 harmony	 or	 diapason.
The	 second	 method	 has	 been	 used	 in	 the	 past	 in	 the	 Mysteries,	 where	 the
symbolic	 Image	 of	 the	 candidate’s	 Soul	 was	 evoked	 to	 his	 outer
consciousness	by	the	Hierophant’s	magical	power.	But	such	a	procedure	does
not	belong	to	the	field	of	generalized	public	application.

“However,	what	can	be	accomplished	along	this	line	is	to	interpret	to	the
individual	in	words	this	living	Symbol	of	his	own	Soul-being.	This	symbol
occupies	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 sequence	 of	 varied	 events	 which	 constitute	 a

person’s	destiny	the	place	which	the	tonality	of	a	musical	work	does	to	them
any	notes	of	the	composition,	or	the	place	which	the	seed	holds	in	relation	to
the	 plant	 and	 the	 multiplicity	 of	 its	 organs.	 Thus	 the	 term	 ‘Harmonic
Psychology,’	or	as	we	might	also	say:	‘Seed-Psychology.’

“While	psycho-analysis	deals	analytically	and	empirically	with	the	many
elements	 that	 together	 constitute	 the	 human	 psyche,	 harmonic	 psychology
operates	 by	 synthetic	 perception,	 establishing	 itself	 at	 a	 point	 whence	 the
soul	and	destiny	of	man	are	seen	integrated	into	a	fundamental	Chord	of	life-
forces,	 a	 seed-form,	 an	 organic	 symbol	 of	 selfhood.	 Thus	 we	 substitute	 the
vision	of	the	unity	of	a	life-process	for	the	psychological	vivisection	of	man
into	symbolic	fragments.

“Such	a	synthetizing	perception	can	be	reached	by	using	astrological	data
as	 symbolic	 materials.	 The	 astrological	 birth-chart	 can	 be	 considered	 as
determining	 the	 morphology	 of	 the	 soul.	 It	 is	 the	 signature	 of	 the	 birth-
moment,	 the	 form	 taken	 by	 universal	 Life	 according	 to	 a	 particular	 set	 of
time-space	values.	It	pictures	the	seed	and	general	structural	plan	of	growth
of	 the	 human	 being:	 his	 destiny.	 It	 defines	 the	 basic	 relationships	 which
determine	 man’s	 identity	 and	 character,	 the	 harmony	 (consonant	 or
dissonant)	which	in	its	wholeness	is	heard	as	the	tone	of	the	soul.

“The	 difference	 between	 such	 a	 use	 of	 astrological	 references	 and	 the
ordinary	 fortune-telling	 variety	 of	 astrology	 is	 just	 as	 great	 as	 that	 between
the	dream-interpretations	of	the	soothsayer	and	the	use	of	dream	symbolism
in	the	most	scientific	psycho-analysis.	The	symbolic	use	of	astrology	is	just
as	 legitimate	 as	 the	 symbolic	 use	 of	 dreams.	 The	 former	 is	 a	 much	 more
scientific	 and	 impersonal	 tool	 for	 the	 synthetic	 appreciation	 of	 a	 man’s
essential	 nature	 than	 the	 latter,	 colored	 as	 dreams	 are	 by	 the	 patient’s
superficial	reactions—and	also	necessarily	fragmentary.

“Astrology	 has	 been	 debased	 as	 fortune-telling	 and	 usually	 deals	 only
with	 concrete	 events.	 But	 events	 in	 themselves	 are	 not	 important.	 What
matters	 is	 the	 significance	 we	 bestow	 upon	 them.	 It	 is	 only	 by	 giving	 to
events	the	meaning	centered	in	our	own	Soul,	that	we	make	them	real.	There
is	no	reality	except	that	which	we	create	by	the	very	activity	of	continuous
living.	 Thus	 events	 do	 not	 happen,	 we	 happen	 to	 them;	 we	 make	 them
constructive	 or	 destructive.	 We	 must,	 therefore,	 know	 what	 we	 are,	 rather
than	what	events	might	be.	Harmonic	Astrology	deals	with	the	integral	Form
of	Man,	with	the	symbols	of	his	wholeness	of	being,	with	the	archetype	of
his	 destiny	 on	 earth.	 It	 is	 the	 means	 whereby	 the	 Image	 of	 the	 soul	 can	 be

interpreted,	outlined	and	made	manifest	to	the	outer	personal	consciousness.
It	 is	 thus	 able	 to	 start	 the	 creative	 process	 of	 inner	 combustion	 and
repolarization	 which—if	 the	 individual	 is	 really	 intent	 upon	 the	 task	 of
regeneration—leads	 to	 liberation.	 It	 will	 lead	 to	 liberation	 not	 by	 virtue	 of
something	external	entering	into	the	individual,	but	by	 means	of	the	power
which	the	true	form	of	the	soul	possesses	to	compel	the	blurred	image	of	the
personality	to	shape	itself	in	the	likeness	of	its	archetype,	once	the	latter	is
brought	out	of	the	Unconscious	into	the	Conscious	where	it	begins	to	operate
as	a	creative	reality.”

The	 foregoing	 approach	 to	 the	 subject	 is	 completed	 by	 the	 point	 of	 view
described	 in	 the	 following	 paragraphs,	 which	 state	 in	 a	 concise	 manner	 ideas
which	can	be	found	scattered	through	this	book:

“Harmonic	Astrology	deals	entirely	with	the	problem	of	form.	It	is	thus	a
secure	 foundation	 for	 the	 ‘art	 of	 living.’	 It	 deals	 with	 form	 not	 as	 a	 merely
esthetic	 element,	 but	 as	 a	 vessel	 of	 integration	 for	 evolving	 forces.	 The
philosophy	of	astrology	is	thus	the	philosophy	of	form.	No	one	can	approach
the	 findings	 of	 astrology	 in	 a	 completely	 integrating	 way	 who	 does	 not
understand	the	purpose	of	form	in	life,	and	the	results	accomplished	by	life
in	 the	 building,	 maintenance	 and	 disintegration	 of	 forms.	 Everything	 in
astrology	may	be	said	to	revolve	around	this	three-fold	operation.

“What	 is	 a	 human	 body?	 It	 is	 a	 relatively	 permanent	 form	 in	 which
biological	forces	are	brought	to	a	focus	and	made	to	serve	a	single	purpose.
Circulation,	 digestion,	 breathing,	 reproduction,	 are	 functional	 processes
resulting	from	the	harmonization	and	integration	of	many	vital	forces.	When
disintegration	sets	in	and	the	harmony	of	the	forces	operating	in	the	body	is
disturbed,	disease	occurs	and	ultimately	death.

“Ages	of	terrestrial,	collective	evolution	have	brought	the	human	body	to
a	 point	 of	 relative	 perfection	 as	 an	 organic	 whole.	 But	 the	 evolution	 of	 the
psycho-mental	 organism,	 or	 Soul,	 of	 man	 is	 very	 far	 from	 having	 reached
such	a	point,	generically	speaking.	Man	should	be	the	builder	of	this	psycho-
mental	 organism.	 It	 is	 built	 by	 harmonizing	 and	 integrating	 collective
elements,	 ‘soul-forces,’	 all	 that	 we	 inherit	 at	 birth	 or	 assimilate	 throughout
life—so	 that	 these	 elements	 become	 an	 organic	 ‘web	 of	 energies’	 properly
differentiated	and	interrelated:	a	living	whole,	the	wholeness	of	which	is	the
Self	(in	Jung’s	sense	of	the	term).

“Man	should	be	the	harmonizer	of	the	forces	of	his	Destiny,	the	builder
of	his	own	Temple	of	Solomon.’	But	how	can	he	do	so	permanently	unless	he
knows:	1)	the	nature	of	the	energies	he	has	to	deal	with,	and	the	laws	of	their
cyclic	activities;	2)	the	plan	of	the	building?	If	he	does	not	know	the	former
he	is	likely	to	be	wrecked	by	the	unexpected	rush	of	energies;	if	he	has	not
seen	the	plan	of	the	building,	how	can	he	know	where	to	fit	the	materials	he
has	assimilated?	He	is	likely	to	build	a	wall	where	a	pillar	should	stand;	and
dig	caves	under	columns	destined	to	bear	the	weight	of	cupolas.

“Astrology	 helps	 us	 to	 see—at	 least	 intellectually—the	 vision	 of	 our
archetypal	 Form.	 It	 tells	 us	 what	 to	 do	 with	 the	 energies	 which	 work	 in	 us
through	our	days;	not	how	to	destroy	or	even	‘rule’	them	with	an	iron	hand,
but	 how	 to	 balance	 the	 one	 against	 the	 other;	 especially	 it	 teaches	 us	 that
these	 energies	 have	 no	 right	 to	 usurp	 the	 prerogatives	 of	 our	 selfhood	 and
proclaim	 themselves	 as	 T—for	 they	 are	 parts	 and	 not	 the	 whole,	 and	 ‘I’—
when	 truly	 understood	 and	 operating—is	 the	 wholeness	 of	 the	 whole.	 The
real	‘I,’	however,	is	the	wholeness	not	 so	much	of	the	 contents	of	our	total
being,	 as	 of	 the	 archetypal	 form	 of	 this	 total	 being.	 In	 that	 sense	 it	 is	 a
relatively	changeless	T.	It	is	in	fact	the	monad,	the	abstract	quality	that	we
are,	 as	 particular	 manifestations	 of	 universal	 life.	 This	 ‘I’—the	 essence	 of
our	 Archetypal	 Form—is	 not	 however	 actual,	 until	 this	 archetypal	 Form	 is
made	 into	 a	 substantial	 organism—both	 at	 the	 physical	 and	 at	 the	 psycho-
mental	level.”

Much	 of	 the	 foregoing	 may	 have	 to	 be	 understood	 in	 a	 purely	 symbolical
sense;	 but	 one	 idea	 ought	 to	 emerge	 clearly,	 and	 that	 is	 the	 idea	 that	 the	 birth-
chart	of	an	individual	is	the	“signature”	of	the	cyclic	identity,	the	Form	or	Image
of	 his	 essential	 divinity.	 Considered	 as	 a	 whole,	 that	 is	 esthetically,	 it	 is	 the
symbol	 of	 that	 which	 he	 must	 strive	 to	 become.	 It	 is	 therefore	 his	 “magic
talisman.”	 He,	 as	 a	 fluctuating	 and	 evolving	 personality,	 must	 identify	 himself
with	the	wholeness	of	this	birth-chart.	But—and	this	is	essential—the	birth-chart
is	 never	 to	 be	 regarded	 as	 indicating	 life-contents,	 but	 only	 a	 structure	 of
selfhood.	 No	 planet	 should	 ever	 be	 regarded	 as	 an	 entity	 or	 a	 thing	 in	 itself,
representing	 particular	 life-contents;	 for	 to	 identify	 oneself	 with	 one	 planet,
would	 destroy	 —or	 at	 least	 tend	 to	 destroy—the	 wholeness	 of	 the	 personality.
Identification	can	refer	only	to	the	whole	Pattern	of	the	chart.

This	distinction	is	absolutely	essential;	for	all	(temporary)	evil	in	a	life	arises
from	the	fact	that	one	type	of	energy	in	the	personality	has	grown	so	strong	as	to

impose	 its	 will	 upon	 the	 whole	 personality.	 Thus	 we	 say:	 “I	 hate”—”I	 am
angry”—”I	 love,”	 which	 shows	 identification	 of	 the	 “I”	 with	 one	 function	 or
energy	 of	 the	 psyche.	 The	 man	 who	 is	 integrated	 is	 no	 longer	 subject	 to	 such
accidents	 or	 catastrophes.	 He	 can	 say:	 “There	 is	 hate,	 or	 anger,	 or	 love	 rising
within	 me.	 But	 I—the	 essence	 of	 the	 archetypal	 Form	 —see	 and	 watch	 this
onsurge;	 and	 I	 shall	 pit	 against	 it	 the	 combined	 weight	 of	 the	 other	 functions
which	are	operating	within	me;	and	so	the	total	harmony	of	the	whole	of	which	I
am	the	wholeness	will	not	 be	disturbed;	 there	 will	 have	been	 only	an	 inner	re-
adjustment	 of	 equilibrium	 of	 forces—and	 such	 readjustments	 are	 fruitful,	 for
they	help	to	avoid	the	crystallization	of	a	particular	internal	set-up	of	energies	or
functions.	If	I	am	a	strong	intellectual	type	I	shall	welcome	a	strong	emotional
surge;	 for	 it	 will	 give	 to	 my	 intellectual	 function	 something	 to	 do	 besides
thinking	 intellectual	 thoughts	 about	 this	 or	 that.	 It	 will	 force	 them	 to	 combine
with	long	unused	forces	of	my	depths,	to	balance	the	rise	of	the	strong	emotion;
and	that	will	vitalize	my	intellect.”

To	balance—never	to	destroy.	The	strong	emotion	means	power.	It	summons
vital	contents	from	the	living	organic	depths.	These	contents	are	needed	for	the
completion	of	personality.	Everything	there	is	is	needed—but	in	its	proper	place
and	with	proper	emphasis	in	relation	to	the	purpose	of	the	whole.	A	man	minus
anything	 cannot	 become	 a	 “god.”	 Neither	 can	 he	 do	 so	 with	 too	 much	 of
anything.	The	fulfilled	personality	is	an	organism:	that	is,	a	balanced,	operative
whole.

There	may	be,	there	are	other	paths	toward	stages	of	being	that	may	be	said
to	transcend	man,	as	we	know	him.	If	we	postulate	the	principle	that	any	whole
is	 eventually	 to	 find	 itself	 a	 part	 in	 a	 greater	 Whole,	 then	 man’s	 destiny	 is	 to
operate	as	a	part	in	the	“Greater	Individual”—however	we	may	choose	to	define
and	circumscribe	the	latter.	If	this	be	true,	then	there	might	be	various	“paths,”
following	which,	this	identification	of	the	“lesser	individual,”	as	such,	with	the
function	 that	 he	 may,	 or	 should,	 fill	 within	 the	 “Greater	 Individual,”	 can	 be
effected.	 Thus	 occultism	 mentions	 several	 “paths”	 of	 spiritual	 development,
several	 margas	 or	 yogas,	 following	 which	 man	 may	 reach	 more	 nearly	 to	 a
cosmic	level	of	functioning	within	the	“Greater	Individual.”

However	this	may	be,	the	approach	which	we	are	stressing	in	this	book—and
which,	 we	 believe,	 is	 the	 typical	 and	 natural	 approach	 from	 the	 standpoint	 of
astrology—can	 be	 summed	 up	 by	 the	 words:	 harmonization,	 integration,
fulfillment.	 It	 is	 based	 on	 an	 understanding	 of	 form,	 equilibrium,	 balanced
operation	and	synthesis.	It	is	crowned	and	made	significant	by	the	operation	of

the	creative,	through	which	alone	the	conflict	between	individual	and	collective
is	 solved—solved	 by	 significant,	 symbolic,	 creative,	 power-releasing	 action.	 It
involves	 the	 use	 of	 creative	 imagination.	 It	 involves	 an	 esthetic,	 as	 against	 an
ethical,	approach.	It	demands	of	the	individual	that	he	have	the	courage	to	stand
as	an	individual,	to	assume	conscious	responsibility,	to	face	the	future	as	a	father
—and	(mystically	speaking)	as	a	sacrifice	to	the	cycle	that	will	be	ushered	in	by
his	creative	act.	It	demands,	moreover,	understanding—and	beauty:	intuition	and
self-culture.	 Being	 a	 creative	 whole,	 he	 should	 know	 how	 to	 face,	 as	 a	 whole,
whole	 situations:	 which	 means	 intuition	 and	 that	 understanding	 which	 passes
intellection.	Being	a	projector	of	his	own	image,	he	should	fulfill	the	duty	that
every	 person	 has	 to	 reveal,	 and	 image	 forth	 in	 his	 own	 life	 the	 maximum	 of
beauty—of	 body,	 soul	 and	 mind—of	 which	 his	 inheritance	 has	 made	 him
capable.

This	is	the	path	of	personality-integration,	the	path	of	creative	significance,
the	path	of	release	of	power	through	Form.	The	occult	quality	of	this	path	may
be	looked	for	in	the	numbers	1—4—7;	which,	by	kabbalistic	addition,	add—as
we	already	saw—to	28.	Symbols	again.	But	by	using	such	symbols	intuition	is
developed.	 Intuition	 leads	 to	 true	 “seership”—and	 the	 seer	 is	 he	 who	 sees	 in
every	thing	of	Life	a	living	significance.	All	things	reveal	to	him	their	archetypal
form,	their	essential	“birth-charts.”	All	things	are	known	by	their	vital	“names.”
And	this	alone	gives	to	a	man	power;	for	to	name	correctly	is	to	have	power	over
the	 thing	 or	 process	 named—and	 it	 is	 also	 to	 understand	 with	 that	 “creative
understanding”	which	alone,	as	Keyserling	so	beautifully	reveals,	can	give	birth
to	the	“new	world”	for	which	all	men	of	understanding	and	nobility	and	spiritual
vision	not	only	yearn,	but	work.

### Astrology	and	the	Process	of	Civilization

Living	civilization	is	a	process;	not	a	thing.	It	is	the	process	of	the	gestation
of	Man—the	seed-condition	of	perfected	mankind.	A	fallacious	theory,	product
of	 the	 earth-bent	 European	 mind,	 has	 made	 of	 civilization	 a	 death	 of	 living
values.	 But	 the	 seed	 is	 not	 dead.	 Civilization	 is	 not	 to	 be	 referred	 to	 the
crystallized,	strawlike	stalk	of	a	plant	as	the	fall	begins.	Such	a	civilization	is	not
the	true,	living	civilization;	it	is	merely	the	end	of	the	cultural	cycle.

Culture	is	the	equivalent	of	the	process	of	change—of	the	personality,	which
is	an	ever	unstable	balance	of	individual	and	collective	factors.	It	originates	in	a
spiritual-monadic	 Impulse;	 which	 is	 the	 One-that-is-in-the-beginning,	 the
“Avatar,”	the	great	Universal	Person	who,	as	it	were,	winds	up	the	spring	of	the

cycle-to-be	 —because	 He	 is	 a	 direct	 agent,	 an	 embodied	 act-of-will	 of	 the
“Greater	 Individual,”	 the	 Planetary	 Being.	 Then	 culture	 develops	 through
endless	vicissitudes	and	transformations;	just	as	germ,	stem	and	root,	leaves,	and
finally	 flower	 and	 fruit	 grow—grow	 from	 the	 earth,	 bound	 to	 the	 earth	 and	 its
physiological,	positive-negative	energies.

At	last	the	seed	forms	itself	within	the	fruit;	and	as	this	occurs	the	seasonal
plant	 already	 begins	 to	 die.	 The	 stem	 hardens.	 Culture	 becomes	 a	 set	 of
stereotyped	formulas	of	thinking,	feeling	and	behavior.	Presently	the	seed	falls	to
the	ground.	Already	the	leaves	have	begun	to	disintegrate	earthward,	to	become
later	on	the	manure	which	releases	chemical	substance—collective	elements	—
to	feed	the	new	plant	which	will	rise	at	the	call	of	the	new	Spring.	But	the	seed
does	not	disintegrate.	It	lives;	and	this	life	is	one	of	concentrated	and	relatively
permanent	wholeness;	for	in	the	seed	is	contained	in	potency	the	whole	sum	of
the	characteristics	and	the	power	of	the	species.

Living	civilization	is	the	seed	of	Man;	but	it	is	also	the	process	that	calls	the
seed	into	being—the	process	of	individuation;	and	the	process	in	which	the	seed
dies	 as	 a	 seed	 that	 the	 new	 plant	 may	 be—the	 process	 of	 sacrifice.	 Living
civilization	 is	 the	 creative	 principle	 operating	 through	 the	 human	 race	 as	 a
whole.	It	is	especially	manifest	in	the	“last	moment”	of	the	cycle,	when	all	that	is
living	 and	 true	 to	 the	 archetypal	 pattern	 that	 is	 in	 the	 beginning	 is	 gathered
together	into	a	seed-synthesis	which	will	be	food	to	a	humanity	as	yet	to	come.
According	 to	 prophetic	 symbolism,	 two-thirds	 will	 be	 lost—that	 is,	 they	 will
disintegrate	 as	 leaves	 and	 stalk,	 and	 even	 as	 fruit.	 But	 one-third	 will	 be	 saved.
These	 will	 constitute	 the	 seed—the	 Shistas:	 those	 in	 and	 through	 whom	 the
creative	principle	will	play	a	new	symphony	of	being	as	Spring	rings	the	call	and
leads	the	performance.

These	 performers	 who,	 as	 a	 group,	 constitute	 the	 seed,	 the	 orchestra,	 are
those	 that	 have	 become	 “separate;”	 those	 that	 have	 experienced	 a	 “second
birth”—birth	 out	 of	 the	 realm	 of	 decaying	 leaves	 into	 that	 of	 the	 consecrated
seed.	These	individuals	are	trained	eventually	to	perform	their	group-work.	They
are	trained	individually	and	as	a	group.	They	are	not	to	be	soloists,	but	players	in
an	 orchestra.	 They	 must	 give	 up	 something	 of	 their	 “personality”	 (in	 the	 usual
sense	of	the	term)	in	order	that	a	“group-personality”	may	be	born:	the	orchestra.
They	have	to	do	so,	if	they	are	to	remain	in	the	orchestra,	because	the	orchestra
is	some	day	to	perform	a	symphonic	score.

A	 score	 is	 a	 formula	 of	 relationship,	 a	 pattern	 of	 symbolic	 entities,	 called

“notes	of	music.”	A	score	is	the	raison	d’étre	and	purpose	of	 the	performance,
and	 of	 the	 orchestra.	 The	 score	 is	 the	 abstract	 entity	 which	 is	 the	 form	 of	 the
group-personality	 which	 is	 the	orchestra.	We	may	 imagine	 that	 the	orchestra	is
gathered	and	trained	to	perform	only	one	symphonic	score.	If	so,	then	this	score
is	the	structural	archetype	of	the	orchestral	group-personality.	For	it	is	the	score
that	will	determine	what	instruments	are	needed,	and	where	and	when	each	shall
have	to	sound	out,	to	play	the	part	reserved	to	it.

True,	 there	 may	 develop	 personal	 relationships	 (friendship,	 dislike,	 etc.)
between	 the	 players	 as	 emotional	 human	 beings;	 but	 such	 relationships	 must
ever	 be	 subservient	 to	 the	 one	 goal	 of	 the	 orchestral	 group-personality:	 the
performance	of	the	score.	The	basic	and	permanent	set	of	relationships	between
the	performers	 is	one	determined	 by	 the	score	 to	be	played.	It	is	 an	archetypal
relationship	of	work	and	of	purpose—a	creative	relationship;	and	not	a	personal
or	individual-collective	relationship	of	feelings,	dependent	largely	on	moods	and
on	the	everchanging	influence	of	natural	or	momentary	conditions.

Such	an	illustration—which	is	accurate	enough—shows	very	clearly	the	part
that	astrology	can	play	in	the	process	of	living	civilization,	and	especially	in	the
process	 of	 gathering-in,	 in	 the	 future,	 performers	 who	 in	 turn	 will	 have	 to
become	“individuated”	into	a	group-personality:	the	orchestra.	Astrology	reveals
the	score	of	the	symphony,	and	the	place	which	each	performer	has	to	occupy	in
the	orchestra.

The	kind	of	astrology	which	can	reveal	the	score	of	a	coming	civilization	is
not	yet	known,	at	least	to	ordinary	men	of	the	present	generation.	Whether	some
“Adepts”	 are	 proficient	 in	 it	 or	 not,	 is	 not	 for	 us	 to	 say.	 We	 have	 touched,
however,	 upon	 the	 subject	 of	 such	 a	 planetary	 astrology	 referring	 to	 the
“planetary	creative,”	in	our	chapters:	“The	Key	to	Astrological	Symbolism”	and
“A	Classification	of	Astrological	Viewpoints.”	It	is	doubtful	whether	much	more
can	 be	 stated	 at	 present,	 though	 there	 may	 be—there	 are,	 if	 we	 believe
Blavatsky’s	 Secret	 Doctrine—men	 who	 at	 all	 times	 have	 been	 trained	 in	 the
knowledge	 of	 the	 intricacies	 of	 planetary	 and	 cosmic	 cycles.	 The	 Great	 Polar
Cycle	 and	 its	 so-called	 “zodiacal	 Ages”—such	 as	 the	 Piscean	 and	 Aquarian
Ages—indicate	 very	 broadly	 the	 characteristics	 of	 great	 civilizations,	 as	 they
wax	 and	 wane	 on	 continents	 which	 are	 their	 physical	bodies.	 Most	 interesting
attempts	 at	 correlating	 the	 precessional	 Ages	 and	 past	 civilizations,	 and	 at
relating	 the	 zodiacal	 signs	 to	 zones	 of	 geographical	 longitudes,	 have	 recently
been	made.	But	claims	are	conflicting,	and	the	final	key	may	not	yet	have	been
discovered.	It	may	depend	upon	a	consideration	of	the	seven-fold	or	seventy-fold

division	 of	 the	 Great	 Polar	 Cycle	 itself,	 as	 we	 have	 already	 suggested,	 rather
than	 on	 that	 of	 the	 twelvefold	 precessional	 motion	 of	 the	 equinoxes	 along	 the
zodiacal-equatorial	belt;	or	better	still,	on	a	correlation	of	both	of	these	points	of
view.

But	 there	 are	 other	 planetary	 cycles	 which	 are	 just	 as	 important	 as	 the	 one
created	by	the	gyration	of	the	Earth’s	polar	axis	in	about	25,868	years.	A	10,000-
year	 cycle,	 which	 might	 be	 called	 symbolically	 that	 of	 the	 Buddha,	 because	 it
deals	with	the	planetary	process	of,	let	us	say,	“cosmic	individuation”—again,	a
symbol!—has	 been	 hinted	 at	 in	 theosophical	 literature	 during	 the	 life	 of	 H.	 P.
Blavatsky	(Cf.	The	Mahatma	Letters).	It	presumably	refers	to	the	same	thing—at
a	planetary	level—with	which	our	previously	studied	28-year	cycle	dealt	at	the
level	of	the	human	personality.	And	there	is	the	same	difference	between	three
10,000-year	cycles	and	the	25,868	Polar	Cycle	as	there	is	between	three	28-year
cycles	and	the	“three	score	and	ten”	traditional	measure	of	man’s	life-span.

Five	 thousand	 years	 have	 elapsed	 since	 what	 the	 Brahmins	 call	 “the
beginning	 of	 Kali	 Yuga”	 (3102	 B.C).	 Twenty-five	 hundred	 years	 have	 passed
since	 the	 coming	 of	 the	 Buddha	 (around	 602	 B.C).	 And	 the	 year	 1898	 (or	 the
period	1891-1898,	which	witnessed	the	death	of	H.	P.	Blavatsky	as	well	as	that
of	Baha’u’-llah)	has	been	said	to	mark	the	beginning	of	a	new	era—an	era	which
can	be	conceived	as	the	period	of	spiritual	gestation	or	perhaps	early	babyhood
of	a	new	type	of	human	Individualhood	at	the	psycho-mental	level.	The	diagram
above	will	interpret	such	a	cycle	in	terms	of	the	conventional	astrological	figure,
and	 may	 be	 of	 interest	 to	 minds	 interested	 in	 such	 cosmic	 symbolism.	 A	 new
spiritual	 history	 of	 mankind	 may,	 some	 day,	 be	 attempted	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 such
planetary	 cycles.	 But	 our	 knowledge	 thereof	 is	 obviously	 too	 incomplete	 at
present.

### The	Integration	of	Group-personality

However,	 what	 is	 of	 a	 much	 more	 practical	 significance	 in	 our	 present-day
human	lives	is	the	use	to	which	astrology	may	be	put	in	bringing	about	real	and
harmonious	group-personality.	This	subject	is	particularly	timely,	as	there	is	so
much	 emphasis	 laid	 in	 so	 many	 quarters	 upon	 the	 factor	 of	 the	 “group.”	 As	 a
complete	 theme	 for	 discussion	 it	 is	 far	 beyond	 the	 scope	 of	 this	 book;	 and
therefore	we	cannot	attempt	to	evaluate	the	significance,	importance	and	validity
of	this	modern	trend	toward	group-behavior	and	ultimate	group-personality.	This
trend,	 however,	 is	 a	 fact,	 and	 astrology	 has	 much	 to	 say	 on	 the	 problem	 of
devising	 a	 technique	 for	 the	 gathering,	 harmonizing	 and	 integrating	 of	 such
groups.

In	the	most	real	and	valid	sense	of	the	term,	group-personality	is	a	factor	of
reconciliation	 between	 individual	 and	 collective,	 insofar	 as	 human	 society	 is

concerned.	 For	 this	 reason	 we	 may	 consider	 two	 types	 of	 groups:	 1)	 groups
which	are	collectivities	of	individuals;	2)	groups	which	are	individualities	made
up	of	collective	elements.	In	the	first	type,	the	emphasis	is	upon	individuals;	in
the	 second,	 upon	 the	 collective	 nature	 of	 elements	 dominated	 by	 one	 entity,	 or
ideal,	or	book,	or	image.

The	 second	type	of	 groups	is	 the	one	usually	 found	 at	 this	present	stage	 of
human	 development.	 Such	 a	 group	 is	 often	 an	 aggregation	 of	 barely
individualized	 and	 still	 less	 individuated	 personalities,	 drawn	 closely	 together
either	 by	 an	 actual	 leader	 or	 by	 a	 leading	 belief	 and	 authority.	 The	 less
individualized	 are	 the	 members	 of	 the	 group,	 the	 more	 homogeneous	 and
permanent	 it	 is.	 The	 more	 powerful	 the	 leader,	 visible	 or	 invisible,	 the	 more
emotion-arousing	 and	 faith-compelling	 the	 leadership—the	 more	 stable	 the
combination	of	personalities.

The	first	type	of	groups	is	only	beginning	to	appear	in	the	modern	world,	and
that,	 often,	 where	 one	 would	 least	 suspect	 it.	 Here,	 the	 group	 is	 really	 an
association	 (or	 companionship,	 or	 cooperative	 comradeship)	 of	 differentiated
and	self-reliant	individuals	brought	together	for	a	common	work	and	in	order	to
further	a	common	purpose	and	demonstrate	an	ideal	held	valid	by	all.	The	group
is	held	together	by	a	common	realization,	and,	in	a	sense,	a	common	“quality”	of
being,	 rather	 than	 by	 a	 common	 belief.	 It	 has	 very	 little	 to	 do	 with	 personal
feelings—in	the	ordinary	sense	of	the	term.	It	admits	of	no	compulsion,	save	that
of	the	common	purpose	and	of	the	need	of	the	jointly	undertaken	work.	Its	basic
postulate	is	that	every	individual	should	be	free	to	work	out	his	own	destiny	in	a
natural	and	individual	manner;	that	he	should	do	what	he	can	best	do,	and	that
group-operation	 is	 not	 only	 not	 to	 hinder	 the	 play	 of	 the	 individually	 creative,
but	 on	 the	 contrary	 is	 meant	 to	 stimulate	 and	 enhance	 it,	 to	 give	 it	 more
significance,	more	power,	a	greater	scope	and	permanency	of	action.

The	difficulty	is,	obviously,	that	unless	one	individual’s	free	creative	actions
fit	in	with	other	individuals’	free	creative	actions,	unless	all	these	actions	work
into	each	other	harmoniously,	in	time	and	space	relationship,	without	sacrificing
the	 essential	 value	 of	 spontaneity	 and	 ease—there	 is	 bound	 to	 be	 conflict	 and
struggle.	 Briefly	 speaking,	 unless	 the	 individuals	 composing	 the	 group	 fit
together	structurally,	as	do	the	pieces	of	a	jig-saw	puzzle,	such	a	type	of	group
cannot	operate	satisfactorily	for	any	length	of	time.	For	if	there	were	to	be	real
cooperation	 (working	 together)	 of	 individuals	 not	 fitting	 together	 structurally
and	a	priori,	then	some	of	these	individuals	would	necessarily	have	to	alter	their
creative	 rhythm,	 and	 in	 this	 become	 what	 they	 are	 not—granted	 of	 course	 that

they	 actually	 were	what	 they	 archetypally	 are,	 before	 they	 met	 to	 constitute	 a
group.

This	 last	 sentence	 emphasizes	 the	 two-fold	 problem:	 First,	 the	 individuals
who	are	to	constitute	such	a	group	are	most	often	not	actually	individuated.	They
are	 not	 completely	 true	 to	 their	 own	 monad	 and	 archetype.	 They	 are	 as	 yet
incompletely	formed	and	unintegrated	personalities.	Because	of	that,	there	is	no
definite-ness	and	unadulterability	in	their	behavior	and	their	creative	processes.
They	are	neither	solid	nor	steady.	They	follow	moods,	feelings,	and	all	sorts	of
un-formed	 imperatives.	 They	 are	 unknowns—to	 themselves	 as	 well	 as	 to	 their
associates.	 To	 constitute	 a	 real	 group	 with	 such	 persons	 is	 like	 playing	 a
symphony	with	musicians	who	are	not	sure	what	note	will	actually	sound	when
they	perform	on	their	own	instruments.

The	 other	 difficulty	 (in	 case	 of	 the	 associates	 being	 very	 definite	 and	 fully
individuated	personalities)	is	how	to	find	a	number	of	such	individuals	who	will
structurally	 fit	 together—at	 least	 insofar	 as	 their	 creative	 relationship	 to	 the
common	 goal	 is	 concerned.	 Short	 of	 some	 super-normal	 intuitive	 and	 direct
perception	 of	 the	 structural	 characteristics	 of	 all	 the	 individuals	 from	 whom
those	 who	 are	 to	 constitute	 the	 group	 could	 be	 selected,	 astrology	 is	 the	 only
solution	to	the	problem.

Here	we	are	dealing	with	the	complex	problem	of	establishing	and	correctly
interpreting	valid	relationships	between	the	birthcharts	of	two	and	more	than	two
individuals.	To	study	how	this	can	be	done	is	also	beyond	the	scope	of	this	book.
All	that	we	wish	to	state	now	is	that,	theoretically	at	least,	it	can	be	satisfactorily
done.	In	practice	there	are	numerous	difficulties	to	reckon	with.

The	first	one	is	to	ascertain	the	exact	nature	of	the	contemplated	relationship.
We	have	often	seen	two	persons	coming	with	both	their	charts,	for	advice	as	to
whether	they	should	or	should	not	marry.	Our	answer	to	this	is	always:	What	do
you	 want
to	 marry	 for?	 What	 kind	 of	 marriage-relationship	 are	 you
contemplating?	 For	 what	 purpose?	 Not	 all	 people	 marry	 for	 the	 purpose,
consciously	 or	 unconsciously,	 of	 making	 a	 home,	 raising	 children,	 and	 all	 that
goes	 with	 that.	 Marriage	 can	 be	 regenerative.	 It	 can	 produce	 spiritual
repolarization.	It	 can	 free	both	 partners	from	 complexes	and	inhibitions.	All	 of
which	 may	 not	 include	 home,	 children	 or	 even	 the	 usual	 kind	 of	 happiness.
Marriage	can	be	a	dissonant	harmony,	or	a	consonant	harmony.	It	may	be	meant
to	 be	 permanent;	 or	 only	 for	 a	 period.	 It	 can	 include	 deep	 conflicts	 and
oppositions	 of	 attitudes—and	 yet	 be	 the	 very	 salvation,	 the	 very	 need	 of	 both

partners.	Who,	then,	shall	wish	to	take	the	responsibility	of	advising	two	persons
not	to	marry	because	strong	conflicts	and	contrasts	are	shown	by	comparing	the
two	birth-charts?

This	is	one	difficulty.	Another	is	the	usual	uncertainty	about	the	exact	birth-
moment	 of	 an	 individual—even	 more	 so	 of	 a	 dozen	 or	 two	 persons.	 There	 are
still	other	difficulties	which	are	related	to	the	fact	that	the	psychology	of	the	kind
of	 group	 we	 are	 now	 considering	 is	 very	 little	 understood;	 that	 in	 such	 groups
secondary	 relationships	 are	 almost	 necessarily	 formed,	 and	 those	 at	 various
levels.	 Yet,	 in	 spite	 of	 it	 all,	 one	 can	 say	 that	 astrology,	 by	 comparing	 birth-
charts,	can	define	the	kind	of	relationship	to	be	expected	between	the	individuals
symbolized	by	these	charts.	Various	other	astrological	methods,	too	intricate	to
detail,	can	also	be	used	in	dealing	with	this	matter	of	relationship.

The	 result	 is	 that	 one	 might	 be	 able	 to	 select,	 by	 studying	 their	 charts’
relationships,	let	us	say,	twelve	fully	developed	individuals,	who	would	be	able
to	cooperate	toward	the	furtherance	of	a	common	purpose	overshadowing	them
all,	in	such	a	way	that	the	activities	of	each	would	remain	exactly	true	to	his	or
her	individual	selfhood	and	destiny,	and	yet	in	such	a	way	that	all	these	activities
would	fit	together—just	as	the	individual	performances	of	musicians	composing
an	 orchestra	 fit	 together	 in	 the	 orchestral	 rendition	 of	 a	 symphony.	 In	 this
orchestral	analogy,	to	be	a	first	violin	or	a	second	French	horn	or	a	first	bassoon
would	 correspond	 to	 the	 generic	 selfhood	 of	 the	 personalities	 composing	 the
group	 (their	 racial	 type,	 their	 background—occultly	 speaking	 their	 “Ray”	 of
development);	while	the	individual	selfhood	would	be	symbolized	by	the	written
musical	part	which	the	player	is	to	perform	and	which	is	the	“signature”	of	his
function	in	the	group.

Astrology	cannot	tell	much,	if	anything,	as	to	the	generic	selfhood;	but	it	can
deal	satisfactorily	with	the	“score”	or	the	“blueprint”	of	the	individual	selfhood.
In	 the	 case	 of	 the	 formation	 of	 a	 group-personality,	 the	 unknown	 factor	 is	 the
“score”	of	this	group-personality	itself;	but	even	there	astrology	might	interpret
significantly	 the	 birth-chart	 of	 the	 group,	 taking	 as	 the	 moment	 of	 birth	 either
that	at	which	the	first	move	toward	the	formation	of	the	group	was	made,	or	that
at	which	the	first	concrete	manifestation	of	group-activity	or	group-relationship
occurred.

If	we	carry	on	the	illustration	of	the	orchestra,	shall	we	have	to	say	that	the
orchestra	 needs	 a	 leader?	 It	 needs	 obviously	 a	 leading	 factor,	 or	 principle,	 or
purpose;	but	not	necessarily	a	leading	personality.	Conductorless	orchestras	have

proven	 successful.	 But	 the	 point	 is	 really	 beside	 our	 present	 discussion,	 and
could	 be	 discussed	 only	 by	 considering	 what	 relation	 there	 can	 be	 between
human	personalities	and	the	“Greater	Individual”	at	the	planetary	level.

What	 counts	 for	 us	 now	 is	 the	 fact	 that	 astrology	 may	 solve	 the	 basic
dilemma	 in	 the	 constitution	 of	 groups,	 or	 of	 any	 relationship	 between	 two	 or
more	personalities.	If	the	persons	related	are	by	nature	followers,	believers	and
devotees,	 astrology	 is	 of	 small	 service.	 The	 relationship	 will	 be	 strong	 and
enduring	 if	 there	 is	 a	 strong	 power	 dominating	 the	 relationship.	 In	 the	 typical
marriage	 of	physiologically-emotionally	 centered	beings,	this	power	is	 sex:	 the
race-purpose	 and	 social	 purpose	 dominate	 the	 relationship.	 In	 the	 ordinary
groups—whether	 they	 be	 called	 “occult,”	 religious	 or	 political,	 or	 even,	 at	 the
limit,	a	gang—a	leader,	visible	or	invisible,	dominates	with	his	strong	individual-
personal	 power	 an	 aggregation	 of	 followers.	 Such	 groups,	 as	 well	 as	 the
emotional	marriage,	are	parts	of	the	karmic	pattern	which	rules	men	who	are	not
yet	 individuated,	 just	 as	 biological	 urges	 and	 instincts	 rule	 the	 animal	 and	 the
plant.	All	these	relations	and	combinations	of	desires,	impulses,	loves,	hatred—
all	this	birthing,	dying	and	rebirth,	belong	to	the	collective,	to	the	vast	ebb	and
flow	 of	 the	 life-process—to	 that	 infinite,	 incommensurable	 sea	 of	 becoming
which	goes	on	and	on.

Astrology	can	do	little	in	relation	to	such	collective	factors.	It	may	reveal	the
unavoidable	future	crises	and	end	of	the	relationship.	But	of	what	good	is	it	to
tell	someone	who	is	helpless,	because	he	is	not	really	a	one,	that	he	will	be	shot
in	so	many	days!	Where	there	is	no	freedom—and	there	is	little	freedom,	indeed,
in	 relationships	 controlled	 by	 biological	 urges	 or	 by	 the	 blind	 psychic	 force	 of
belief—astrology	 is	 usually	 more	 destructive	 than	 constructive.	 And	 freedom
exists	only	in	function	of	the	individual.	Only	that	which	is	whole	can	ever	be
free.

In	 terms	 of	 groups,	 only	 groups	 of	 actual	 individuals	 have	 any	 need	 of
astrology,	 because	 in	 those	 groups	 only	 is	 there	 a	 problem	 of	 how	 to	 balance
inherent	 individual	 freedom	 and	 the	 efficiency	 of	 the	 group;	 how	 to	 retain
individual	form	within	the	group-structure.	 No	group	 of	 individuals	is	possible
unless	 this	 problem	 is	 solved.	 And	 to	 solve	 this	 problem	 does	 not	 mean	 that	 a
leader	should	select	the	members	of	his	“orchestra”	astrologically;	but	it	should
rather	mean	that	individual	performers	should	come	together	on	the	basis	of	such
a	structural-astrological	knowledge	of	relationship.

### We	 have	 referred	 elsewhere	 to	 such	 a	 significant	 relationship	 between

### intense

### living	 and	 strenuous

creative	 individuals	 as	 an	 “air-relationship,”	 in	 contradistinction	 to	 “earth-
relationship”	 or	 “blood-relationship”	 which	 binds	 emotionally	 and	 tends	 to
reduce	 the	 relata	 to	 a	 heavy	 mass-powerful	 perhaps,	 yet	 neither	 free	 nor
significant	in	terms	of	individuals.	We	have	called	for	“an	aristocracy	of	Living
Persons	 integrated	 by	 a	 common	 will	 to	 serve	 Life	 and	 Man;	 a	 creative
aristocracy;	 an	 aristocracy	 of	 Equals	 in	 terms	 of	 Soul-equality,	 not	 of	 body
similarity	or	likeness	of	duty;	an	aristocracy	which	would	be	a	group	by	virtue	of
the	unanimous	self-consecration	of	its	units	to	a	common	purpose	self-evident	to
each	 and	 all.	 This	 group	 would	 be	 dynamic,	 mobile,	 always	 in	 action—by
thought	or	deed:	a	web	of	centers	of	force	and	releases	of	power,	radiating	the
energy	 of
interrelationship,	 shirking	 no
responsibility,	 ready	 to	 serve	 in	 utter	 self-dedication	 to	 the	 Cause,	 always
creating	values,	individually	and	in	group;	always	stirring	and	fecundating	minds
and	souls.	Not	a	static	body	rooted	in	self-complacent	isolation,	but	a	unanimous
Idea	 operating	 concretely	 in	 utmost	 diversity	 through	 many	 individual	 centers
acting	as	foci	for	the	greater	Whole	in	widely	different	conditions;	in	all	states,
countries,	 classes,	 religions;	 ubiquitous,	 plastic,	 self-regenerating,	 unbound	 by
dogma,	rooted	only	in	Life	and	Purpose,	universalistic—a	moving	force	of	Free
Men	and	Free	Women	who	dare	to	assume	the	creative	responsibility	of	a	New
World.	 With	 a	 somewhat	 different	 emphasis,	 Alice	 Bailey	 has	 been	 holding
before	 her	 students,	 and	 before	 the	 vast	 number	 of	 the	 readers	 of	 her
publications,	the	ideal	of	a	universalistic	and	spiritually	creative	“New	Group	of
World	Servers;”	and	modern	Theosophists	have	spoken	for	over	fifty	years,	with
varying	degrees	of	comprehension,	of	a	ubiquitous	“White	Lodge”	of	Adepts—
which	 as	 a	 group	 constitutes	 the	 Seed-Being	 of	 the	 Last	 Day	 of	 our	 human-
planetary	cycle.

In	these	cases,	and	in	others	which	more	or	less	approach	a	similar	type	of
group-ideal,	 the	 basic	 emphasis	 is	 always	 to	 be	 put	 upon	 the	 creative
significance	of	the	individual.	Individuals	cooperating,	co-creating;	companions
who	(etymologically	speaking)	“eat	of	the	same	bread”	of	significance,	“friends”
who	have	made	of	their	personal	relations	a	vast	relationship	of	living	friendship
—but	always	individuals,	because	the	“greater	Whole”	that	is	the	end	of	human
planetary	evolution	can	be	formed	only	by	the	creative	interaction	of	men	who
are	whole,	and	thus	individuals.

Astrology,	 when	 symbolically	 and	 structurally	 interpreted,	 can	 guide	 and
give	full	significance	to	such	a	creative	interaction	of	individuals.	It	becomes,	as
such,	an	art	of	interpretation	of	symbolic	forms	of	relationship;	and	it	can	serve

the	purpose	of	the	formation	of	groups,	because	it	itself	deals	with	groupings	of
symbolic	 factors,	 and	 is	 a	 practical	 method	 of	 perception	 of	 the	 meaning	 of
groups	 in	 the	 process	 of	 their	 becoming	 fully	 individuated	 as	 integral
personalities.

Personality,	in	this	sense,	appears	as	the	final	stage	of	the	life-process;	and	it
can	 mean	 either	 the	 Christ-like	 human	 Personality,	 or	 the	 “Greater	 Person”
whom	 we	 may	 call	 the	 Planetary	 Whole;	 or,	 in	 between	 the	 two,	 any	 Group-
Personality	 which	 has	 cyclically	 permanent	 and	 creative
individual
characteristics.	 But	 it	 is	 these	 individual	 characteristics	 which	 give	 form	 and
significance	 to	 Personality,	 because	 in	 every	 case	 Personality	 is	 the	 stage	 of
complete	 actualization	 of	 individual	 Form.	 It	 is	 the	 cyclic	 end	 which	 is	 the
fulfillment	 in	 a	 substantial	 organism	 of	 the	 cyclic	 beginning.	 The	 individual	 is
the	potential	structure;	the	fully	individuated	personality,	the	actual	organism.

Meaning	 resides	 in	 this	 consummation	 of	 the	 Last	 Day	 of	 the	 cycle.	 It	 is	 a
function	of	the	wholeness	of	the	individuated	whole.	It	resides	in	the	individual
pole	 of	 being,	 as	 against	 the	 essential	 meaninglessness	 of	 the	 vast	 tides	 of	 the
collective.	In	wholeness	alone	is	there	intelligence	and	understanding—for	in	it
only,	 because	 it	 is	 an	 end-moment	 and	 fulfillment,	 is	 there	 form	 conscious	 of
itself,	 and	 is	 there	 beauty.	 The	 world-process	 has	 no	 meaning.	 No	 event	 has
meaning,	 save	 as	 man	 gives	 it	 meaning;	 man—or	 any	 being,	 or	 wholeness	 of
related	beings,	in	whom	there	is	intelligence	and	form	and	fulfillment.

The	 life-process	 has	 no	 meaning,	 save	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 ‘last	 moment”	 of	 its
every	 cycle;	 for	 this	 protean	 “last	 moment”	 is	 Meaning	 itself.	 Neither	 has	 the
life-process	form,	save	in	terms	of	the	“first	moment”	of	its	every	cycle;	for	this
“first	 moment”	 is	 Form	 itself.	 As	 for	 the	 myriads	 of	 events	 which	 crowd	 in
serried	 ranks	 from	 beginning	 to	 end	 of	 innumerable	 cycles,	 these	 are	 but	 the
“happenings”	of	collective	elements,	save	for	him	who	is	able	to	relate	them	to
his	own	“form	of	destiny,”	to	fit	them	meaningfully	into	the	structure	of	his	own
individual	selfhood.	This	individual	selfhood	is	in	the	beginning,	and	it	becomes
ever	 more	 manifest	 and	 concrete	 as	 integrated	 Personality,	 as	 each	 moment	 is
related	to	it	and	stamped,	as	it	were,	with	the	creative	symbol	and	signature	of
the	“I	am.”

“In	the	beginning	was	the	Word”—and	the	Word	is	the	individual	structure
of	Self.	In	the	beginning	was	Form.	Astrology,	as	“the	science	of	all	beginnings”
(Marc	Jones),	is	therefore	the	one	revealer	of	the	“form”	of	all	things	that	are	in
process	of	becoming.	Meaning	is	completed	when	the	potential	form,	and	back

of	 that	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 One-that-is-in-the-beginning—the	 Monad	 —is
actualized	 as	 a	 fulfilled,	 integrated	 organism.	 In	 integration	 alone	 is	 meaning
made	 real	 and	 creative.	 The	 process	 of	 individuation	 is	 that	 universal	 process
which	 ends	 in	 the	 realization	 of	 meaning.	 It	 starts	 with	 Form	 and	 ends	 in
Significance;	and	all	meaning	is	born	within	the	innermost	of	the	individual,	but
of	an	individual	who,	after	constant	assimilations	of	collective	life-contents,	has
reached	a	condition	of	fulfillment	as	integrated	Personality.

There	 is	 the	 individual—and	 there	 is	 Life.	 And	 Life	 is	 a	 vast,	 limitless,
formless	flux	of	energies	which	obeys	but	one	Law:	the	Law	of	Equilibrium,	of
balance—or	of	conpensatory	action.	Out	of	this	Law,	which	involves	the	trinity
of	 motion,	 space	 and	 duration,	 arises	 the	 type	 of	 activity	 which	 we	 called
“cyclic.”	 All	 cycles	 are	 essentially	 pendulum-like	 oscillations—or	 call	 them
“vibrations.”	 And	 all	 these	 oscillations,	 infinite	 in	 their	 smallness	 as	 in	 their
vastness,	are	aimless,	meaningless.	They	are—and	that	fact	is	the	substratum	of
all,	and	yet	means	nothing	in	particular.	These	oscillations	have	obviously	four
basic	 moments,	 exemplified	 by	 the	 four	 cardinal	 moments	 of	 the	 Sun’s	 yearly
journey:	solstices,	points	of	farther	disequilibrium,	equinoxes,	points	of	unstable
equilibrium.	These	are	the	four	great	symbols	of	the	cycle	of	change,	the	cycle	of
natural,	biological	energies	which	wax	and	wane,	meaninglessly.

But	 for	 the	 man	 who	 has	 become	 individuated,	 and	 who	 has	 established
individual	 consciousness	 at	 the	 mental	 level	 of	 being,	 where	 Form	 is	 revealed
and	 Significance	 rises	 out	 of	 lives	 lived	 in	 fulfillment,	 the	 meaningless	 Four
become	 the	 Three,	 in	 which	 there	 is	 meaning.	 This	 meaning	 is	 the	 realm	 of
beginning-middle-and-end.	 This	 is	 the	 realm	 of	 the	 alpha	 and	 the	 omega
integrated	in	the	living	Christ—the	man	who	is	whole	and	full	of	seed.	As	this
Christ-state	 is	 reached,	 the	 Three	 merge	 into	 the	 eternal	 One;	 and	 the	 realm	 of
spirit	 is	 born	 anew.	 It	 is	 born	 anew	 in	 every	 Christ-being;	 for	 it	 is	 not	 a
postulated	 fact,	 but	 a	 reality	 that	 emerges	 only	 from	 within	 the	 individual
structure	 of	 fulfillment,	 out	 of	 the	 individual	 bestowing	 of	 significance	 upon
every	moment,	experienced	in	beauty.

It	is	this	fulfillment	in	beauty	and	in	the	harmony	that	is	peace,	which	builds
spirit	ever	anew.	Spirit	is	the	creative	consummation	of	every	moment.	Spirit	is
the	 integrating	 of	 beginning	 and	 end	 in	 a	 synthesis	 that	 is	 reborn	 and	 made
significant	at	every	moment.	It	is	the	cycle	concentrated	into	the	Now.	It	is	the
Creative	Now.

### May	 the	 power	 of	 this	 Creative	 Now	 illumine	 our	 every	 moment	 with

significance!	Indeed	there	is	beauty	and	meaning	in	every	moment—because	in
every	moment	the	individual	may	reach	integration	and	joy	that	is	creative,	that
fathers	 forth	 new	 cycles	 and	 affirms	 toward	 the	 unknown	 the	 noble	 will	 to
destiny.	The	skies	above	are	no	more	radiant,	the	form	of	constellations	no	more
luminous	and	revealing,	than	is	the	realization	within	our	deepest	selfhood	that
we	are	whole;	that	in	wholeness	which	is	creative	everything	that	is	and	ever	will
be	 is	 fulfilled	 in	 the	 Now.	 Oh!	 indeed—NOW—all	 is	 beautiful!	 The	 Whole	 is
beautiful.

### “Astrology	and	Analytical	Psychology.”

RUDHYAR,	born	in	Paris,	France	on	March	23,	1895,	intuitively	realized
two	things	which	deeply	influenced	his	life	and	work:	(1)	Time	is	cyclic,	and	the
law	 of	 cycles	 describes	 all	 civilizations	 as	 well	 as	 all	 existence;	 (2)	 Western
Civilization	is	now	in	what	could	be	symbolically	called	the	autumn	phase	of	its
period	of	existence.	Rudhyar	divorced	himself	from	Europe	and	sought	a	“New
World”,	into	which	he	could	sow	himself	as	a	seed,	carrying	within	his	being	the
legacy	of	whatever	was	viable	and	constructive	in	the	European	past.	In	the	late
fall	 of	 1916,	 he	 came	 to	 the	 USA,	 leaving	 behind	 his	 ancestral	 French	 culture
and	his	family	name,	Chenneviere.

The	 change	 of	 name	 was	 symbolic	 of	 a	 total	 dedication	 to	 his	 ideal:	 the
transformation	of	our	civilization,	and	a	‘revaluation	of	values.	He	changed	his
name	 to	 Rudhyar,	 a	 name	 derived	 from	 the	 Sanskrit	 root	 Rudra	 implying
dynamic	action	and	the	electrical	power	released	during	storms.	The	god	Rudra
in	the	Vedas	is	the	Destroyer	and	Regenerator,	the	transforming	energy	and	the
breaker	 of	 old	 molds.	 This	 sense	 of	 destiny	 released	 through	 Rudhyar
tremendous	 energy	 which	 he	 channeled
the	 development	 of	 his
philosophical	ideas;	through	his	music	and	the	use	of	tone;	through	painting	as
the	Art	of	Gestures;	through	astrology	as	a	symbolic	language	with	the	potential
to	bring	individuals	in	tune	with	cosmic	cycles.
