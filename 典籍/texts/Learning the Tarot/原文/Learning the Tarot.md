Preface
Welcome to Learning the Tarot-my course on how to read the tarot cards. The tarot is a
deck of 78 picture cards that has been used fur centuries to reveal hidden truths. In the past
few years, interest in the tarot has grown tremendously. More and more people are seeking
ways to blend inner and outer realities so they can live their lives more creatively. They have
discovered in the tarot a powerful tool fur personal growth and insight.
My main purpose in this course is to show you how to use the cards fur yourself The tarot
can help you understand yourself better and teach you how to tap your inner resources more
confidently. You do not have to have "psychic powers" to use the tarot successfully. All you
need is the willingness to honor and develop your natural intuitive abilities.
I began writing this course in 1989. I had been studying the tarot fur some years, and I
fuund that I was developing some ideas about the cards and how they could be used as a tool
for inner guidance. In October 1995, I created my Learning the Tarot website to share my
thoughts with others in the Internet community.
Since that time, thousands of people from all over the world have visited my website.
Many have written to share their experiences with me via email. Often they tell me they have
always been curious about the cards, but didn't know how to begin with them. It has been
very exciting to hear how my course has given them the start they were looking fur.
Learning the Tarot is divided into five sections:
Section I contains the 19 lessons that make up the course. They begin with the basics and
gradually move into more detailed aspects of the cards. You can do the lessons at any pace
you like. They are geared toward beginners, but experienced tarot users will find some use­
ful ideas and techniques as well.
Section II contains exercises and practice activities that reinfOrce the concepts presented
in each lesson. The exercises are completely optional.
Section III contains sample responses fur some of the exercises. These are not answers in
the usual sense, but simply suggestions to give you an idea of the kind of interpretations that
are possible.
Section IV contains information on each of the tarot cards. You'll be referring to this sec­
tion as you go through the lessons, but it will also prove useful later as you work with the
tarot on your own.
Section V contains infOrmation on the Celtic Cross Spread-a popular pattern fur laying
out the cards. I refer to this spread throughout the course. Section V also contains some
sample readings based on the Celtic Cross.
The only real requirement for taking this course is a tarot deck. This workbook is illus­
trated with the Universal Waite Tarot which is based on the popular Rider-Waite . These are
both good decks to start with because they have pictures on every card which helps when
X Pre/ace
you are learning. However, if you already have a diffi.rent 78 card deck, you may use it with
the course. The principles of tarot work are much the same no matter what deck you use.
You can buy tarot decks in many places now. Bookstores often carry them, and many
Internet websites offer a variety of tarot decks fOr sale. If you have trouble finding a deck in
your area, you can order one from me. Simply visit my website fOr more infOrmation .
Some people worry that working with the tarot will involve them in occult practices
or create conflicts with their religious beliefS. My approach to the cards is simple and
natural. I try to show that the cards are not dark and mysterious, but wonderfUl tools fOr self­
discovery. In fact, I feel that using the tarot can expand your spiritual awareness in many
positive ways.
Others may believe that the tarot is unscientific-a plaything at best, but certainly not to
be taken seriously by those who know better. I ask only that you indulge your curiosity and
be willing to explore the cards with an open mind. After all, that is the true spirit of scien­
tific endeavor!
I hope you're intrigued enough to try this course. If you're still not sure, read lesson I. It
explains in more detail why using the tarot cards makes sense. I think you will find Learn­
ing the Tarot interesting at least, and perhaps the tool you have been looking fOr to develop
your unrealized potential.

4 Learning the Tarot
This aura of darkness clings to the tarot cards even now. Some reli­
gions shun the cards, and the scientific establishment condemns them
as symbols of unreason, a holdover from an unenlightened past. Let us
set aside these shadowy images fur now and consider the tarot fur what
it is-a deck of picture cards. The question becomes, what can we do
with them?
The answer lies with the unconscious-that deep level of memory and
awareness that resides within each of us, but outside our everyday experi­
ence. Even though we ignore the action of the unconscious most of the
time, it profOundly aflects everything we do. In his writings, Sigmund Freud
stressed the irrational, primitive aspect of the unconscious. He thought
that it was the home of our most unacceptable desires and urges. His con­
temporary Carl .lung emphasized the positive, creative aspect of the unconscious . He tried to
show that it has a collective component that touches universal qualities.
We may never know the full range and power of the unconscious, but there are ways to
explore its landscape. Many techniques have been developed fur this purpose-psycho­
therapy. dream interpretation, visualization, and meditation. The tarot is another such tool.
Consider fur a moment a typical card in the tarot deck, the Five of
Swords. This card shows a man holding three swords and looking at two
figures in the distance. Two other swords lie on the ground. As I look at
this card, I begin to create a story around the image. I see a man who seems
satisfied with some battle he has won. He looks rather smug and pleased
that he has all the swords. The others look downcast and defeated.
What I have done is take an open-ended image and project a story
onto it. To me, my view is the obvious one-the only possible interpre­
tation of this scene. In fuct, someone else could have imagined a totally
different story. Maybe the man is trying to pick up the swords. He's
calling to the others to help him, but they refuse. Or, maybe the other
two were fighting, and he convinced them to lay down their arms.
The point is that of all possible stories, I chose a certain one. Why?
Because it is human nature to project unconscious material onto objects in the environment.
We always see reality through a lens made up of our own inner state . Therapists have long
noted this tendency and have created tools to assist in the process. The fumous Rorschach
inkblot test is based on such projection .4
Projection is one reason why the tarot cards are valuable. Their intriguing pictures and pat­
terns are effective in tapping the unconscious . This is the personal aspect of the tarot, but the
cards also have a collective component. As humans, we all have certain common needs and ex­
periences. The images on the tarot cards capture these universal moments and draw them out
consistently. People tend to react to the cards in similar ways because they represent archetypes.
### 4. Hermann Rorschach, The Rorschach (R) Test (Switzerland, Hans Huber, 1927).

lntroduct;on to the Tarot
Over many centuries, the tarot has evolved into a collection of the most
basic patterns of human thought and emotion.
Consider the Empress. She stands fur the Mother Principle-life in
all its abundance. Notice how her image conjures up feelings ofluxuri­
ance. She is seated on soft, lush pillows, and her robe flows in folds
around her. In the Empress, we sense the bounty and sensual richness
of nature.
The power of the tarot comes from this combination of the personal
and the universal. You can see each card in your own way. but, at the
same time, you are supported by understandings that others have
round meaningful. The tarot is a mirror that reflects back to you the
hidden aspects of your own unique awareness. 5
When we do a tarot reading, we select certain cards by shuffling, cutting, and dealing the
deck. Although this process seems random, we still assume the cards we pick are special. This
is the point of a tarot reading after all-to choose the cards we are meant to see. Now, com­
mon sense tells us that cards chosen by chance can't hold any special meaning-or can they?
To answer this question, let's look at randomness more closely. Usually we say that an event
is random when it appears to be the result of the chance interaction of mechanical fOrces. From
a set of possible outcomes-all equally likely-one occurs, but fur no particular reason.
This definition includes two key assumptions about random events: they are the result of
mechanical fOrces, and they have no meaning. First, no tarot reading is solely the product of
mechanical fOrces. It is the result of a long series of conscious actions. We decide to study the
tarot. We buy a deck and learn how to use it. We shuffle and cut the cards in a certain way
at a certain point. Finally. we use our perceptions to interpret the cards.
At every step, we are actively involved. Why then are we tempted to say a reading is "the
chance interaction of mechanical furces1" Because we can't explain just how our conscious­
ness is involved. We know our card choices aren't deliberate , so we call them random. In fact,
could there be a deeper mechanism at work, one connected to the power of our uncon­
scious' Could our inner states be tied to outer events in a way that we don't yet fully under­
stand? I hold this possibility out to you.
The other feature of a random event is that it has no inherent meaning. I roll a die and
get a six, but there is no purpose to this result. I could just as easily roll a one, and the mean­
ing would be the same-or would it? Do we really know these two outcomes are equal?
Perhaps there is meaning and purpose in every event, great or small, but we don't always
recognize it.
At a party many years ago, I had the sudden urge to pick up a die sitting on the floor. I
knew with great conviction that I would use this die to roll each number individually. As I
began, the laughter and noise of the party faded away. I felt a growing excitement as a differ­
ent number appeared with each roll. It was only with the last successful roll that my every­
day awareness returned, and I sat back, wondering what had happened .
At one level, these six rolls were unrelated, random events, but at another level, they were
very meaningful. My inner experience told me this was so, even though an outside observer
6 Learning the Tarot
might not agree. What was the meaning? At the time, it was a lesson in the strange interac­
tion between mind and matter. Today, I know it had another purpose-to be available to me
now, some twenty-five years later, as an illustration for this very lesson1
Meaning is a mysterious quality that arises at the juncture of inner and outer realities.
There is a message in everything-trees, songs, even trash-but only when we are open to
perceiving it. The tarot cards convey many messages because of the richness of their images
and connections. More importantly, tarot readings communicate meaning because we bring
to them our sincere desire to discover deeper truths about our lives. By seeking meaning in
this way, we honor its reality and give it a chance to be revealed.
If there is meaning in a reading, where does it come from? I believe it comes from that part
of ourselves that is aware of the divine source of meaning. This is an aspect of the unconscious,
yet it is much more. It acts as a wise advisor who knows us well. It understands what we need
and leads us in the direction we need to go. Some people call this advisor the soul, the
superconscious, or the higher self I call it the Inner Guide because that is the tole it plays in
connection with the tarot.
Each of us has an Inner Guide that serves as a fountain of meaning for us. Your Inner
Guide is always with you because it is part of you. You can't destroy this connection, but you
can ignore it. When you reach for your tarot deck, you signal to your Inner Guide that you
are open to its wisdom. This simple act of faith allows you to become aware of the guidance
that was always there for you.
We are meant by nature to rely on the wisdom of our Inner Guide, but somehow we have
forgotten how to access it. We trust our conscious minds instead, and forget to look deeper.
Our conscious minds are clever, but unfortunat ely, they just don't have the full awareness we
need to make appropriate choices day by day.
When we are operating from our conscious minds, we often feel as if events are forced
upon us by chance. Life seems to have little purpose, and we suffer because we do not really
understand who we are and what we want. When we know how to access our Inner Guide,
we experience life differently. We have the certainty and peace that comes from aligning our
conscious will with our inner purpose. Our path becomes more joyous, and we see more
clearly how we bring together the scattered elements of our lives to fulfill our destinies.
I use the tarot because it is one of the best tools I have found to make the whispers of my
Inner Guide more available consciously. The ideas, images, and feelings that emerge as I work
through a reading are a message from my Inner Guide. How do I know there is a message, and
it's not just my imagination 7 I don't. really. I can only trust my experience and see what happens.
You do not really need the tarot to access your Inner Guide. The cards serve the same
function as Dumbo's magic feather. In the Disney movie, Dumbo the Elephant really could
fly on his own, but he didn't believe it. He placed all his faith on the special feather he held
in his trunk. He thought this feather gave him the power to fly, but he found out differently
when it blew away, and he was forced to fall back on his own resources.
The tarot cards may help you fly until you can reach your Inner Guide on your own.
Don't worry for now about how this might happen . .lust play with the cards, work through
the lessons and exercises, and see if you don't experience a few surprises.

Elements of the Tarot
lESSON 2
The Major Arcana
The standard tarot deck consists of 78 cards divided into two sections, the major and minor
arcanas. The word arcana is the plural of arcanum, which means "profOund secret." To the
alchemists of the Middle Ages, the arcanum was the secret of nature. The tarot cards are
therefOre a collection of the "secrets" that underlie and explain our universe.
The 22 cards of the major arcana are the heart of the deck. Each of these cards symbol­
izes some universal aspect of human experience. They represent the archetypes-consistent,
directing patterns of influence that are an inherent part of human nature.
Each card in the major arcana has a name and number. Some names convey a card's mean­
ing directly. such as Strength, Justice, and Temperance. Other cards are individuals who per­
sonifY a particular approach to life, such as the Magician or the Hermit. There are also cards
with astronomical names, such as the Star, Sun, and Moon. They represent the elusive fOrces
associated with these heavenly bodies.
The major arcana cards are special because they draw out deep and complex reactions.
The images on the Universal- Waite deck 1 are evocative because they combine esoteric sym­
bolism with recognizable figures and situations. The symbolism is subtle, but effective.
A major arcana card is always given extra weight in a reading. When one of these cards
appears, you know the issues at stake are not mundane or temporary. They represent your
most basic concerns-your major feelings and motivations. In later lessons, I show in more
detail how you can recognize and interpret the themes of the major arcana in a reading.
The major arcana is often considered as a unit. Different schemes have been developed to
show how the cards form patterns that cast light on the human condition . Numerology. as­
trology. and other esoteric sciences often play a role in these schemes.
Many interpreters view the major arcana as showing the different stages on an individual's
journey of inner growth-what some call the Fool's .Journey (see exercise 2.2, p. 67). In these
systems, each card stands fur some quality or experience that we must incorporate befOre we
can realize our wholeness.
We all travel this road to self-actualization, though our trips more often involve detours,
backups, and restarts than smooth progression1 Our specific paths are unique, but our mile-
l. The Rider-Waite deck was authored by A. E. Waite. Pamela Coleman did the illustrations. The deck was
originally published in England by Rider and Company, hence the "call tag" of the Rider-Waite deck. The
illustrations in this book are from the Universal Waite deck, which is a new version whose colors more
closely resemble the original. Both decks are published by U.S. Games Inc. and are available from most
metaphysical bookstores.
10 Learning the Tarot
stones are universal. The 22 major arcana cards are markers on the path of inner development
leading from earliest awareness <card 0) to integration and fulfillment (card 21 ).
The Fool's Journey seems to move smoothly from one order of experience to the next,
but our learning adventures are usually not so tidy. We make mistakes, skip lessons, and fail
to realize our potential. Sometimes we lack the courage and insight to discover our deepest
levels. Some never feel the call of the Hermit to look inward or never experience the crisis
of the Tower that might free them from their ego defenses.
Many times we try to overcome our difficulties, but fail repeatedly.
The lesson of the Hanged Man-to let go and surrender to experi­
ence-is one that is particularly hard and may need to be faced over and
over before it is fully incorporated. 1 Often we experience lessons out of order. A person may absorb the
qualities of Strength early in life due to a difficult childhood, but only
later develop the Chariot's mastery and control. Someone may over­
come the attraction of the Devil's materialism through a life of seclu­
sion, but then need to learn about relationships and sexuality-a lesson
of the Lovers-at a later time.
The major arcana contains many levels and models of experience .
These cards hold all the patterns of growth, whether they occur within one segment of a life
or a whole life span. We could even say that an entire lifetime is really just one growth epi­
sode within the larger saga of our soul's development.
No matter what our pattern of self-discovery, the major arcana shows us that wholeness
and fulfillment are our destiny. If we keep this promise as our polestar, we will eventually
realize our true nature and gain the World.
lESSON 3
The Minor Arcana
While the major arcana expresses universal themes, the minor arcana brings those themes
down into the practical arena to show how they operate in daily events. The minor arcana
cards represent the concerns, activities, and emotions that make up the dramas of our every­
day lives.
There are 56 cards in the minor arcana divided into fOur suits: Wands, Cups, Swords, and
Pentacles.1 Each of these suits stands fOr a particular approach to life.
Wands
The Wands are the suit of creativity. action, and movement. They are associated with such
qualities as enthusiasm, adventure, risk-taking, and confidence. This suit corresponds to the
yang, or masculine principle, in Chinese philosophy and is associated with the element Fire.
A flickering flame is the perfect symbol of the Wands' fOrce. This energy flows outward and
generates passionate involvement.
Cups
The Cups are the suit of emotions and spiritual experience. They describe inner states, feel­
ings, and relationship patterns. The energy of this suit flows inward. Cups correspond to the
yin, or feminine principle, in Chinese philosophy and are associated with the element Water.
The ability of water to flow and fill up spaces, to sustain and to reflect changing moods makes
it the ideal symbol of the Cups suit.
Swords
The Swords are the suit of intellect, thought, and reason. They are concerned with justice,
truth, and ethical principles . Swords are associated with the element Air. A cloudless sky.
open and light-filled, is a symbol of the mental clarity that is the Swords' ideal. This suit is
also associated with states that lead to disharmony and unhappiness. Our intellect is a valu­
able asset, but as an agent of ego, it can lead us astray if it is not infused with the wisdom of
our Inner Guide.
Pentacles
The Pentacles are the suit of practicality. security. and material concerns. They are associated

we celebrate the beauty of nature, our interactions with plants and animals, and our physi­
cal experiences in the body. Pentacles also represent prosperity and wealth of all kinds. Some-

times this suit is called the Coins, an obvious symbol of the exchange of goods and services
in the physical world. • • •
Each minor arcana suit has a distinct quality all its own. Our everyday experiences are a blend
of these fuur approaches . Your tarot readings will show you how the different suit energies
are impacting your life at any given moment. (See Appendix B fur lists of the suit qualities.)
The suits are structured much as our everyday playing cards with ten numbered cards
(Ace-Ten) and fuur court cards (King, Queen, Knight, and Page). Each card has a role to play
in showing how its energy is expressed in the world.
Aces
An Ace announces the themes of a suit. The Ace of Cups stands fur love, emotions, intuition,
and intimacy-ideas that are explored in the other cards of the Cups suit. An Ace always
represents positive fOrces. It is the standard-bearer for the best its suit has to offer.
Middle Cards
Each of the middle, numbered cards presents a different aspect of a suit. The Wands explore
such themes as personal power (card 2), leadership (card 3), excitement (card 4), and com­
petition (card 5). A card may approach an idea from several angles. The Five of Pentacles
shows the many faces of want-hard times (material want), ill health (physical want), and
rejection (emotional want).
Tens
A Ten takes the themes introduced by an Ace to their logical conclusion . If you take the love,
intimacy. and emotions of the Ace of Cups to their ultimate, you have the joy. peace, and fam­
ily love of the Ten of Cups.
Court Cards
The court cards are people with personalities that reflect the qualities of their suit and rank.
The court cards show us certain ways of being in the world so that we can use (or avoid')
those styles when appropriate.
A King is mature and masculine. He is a doer whose fOcus is outward on the events of life.
He demonstrates authority. control, and mastery in some area associated with his suit. A
King's style is strong, assertive, and direct. He is concerned with results and practical, how-to
matters.
A Queen is mature and feminine. She embodies the qualities of her suit, rather than act­
ing them out. Her fOcus is inward, and her style, relaxed and natural. A Queen is less con­
cerned with results than with the enjoyment of just being in the world. She is associated with
feelings, relationships, and self-expression .
A Knight is an immature teenager. He cannot express himself with balance. He swings
wildly from one extreme to another as he tries to relate successfully to his world. A Knight
is prone to excess, but he is also eager and sincere, and these qualities redeem him in our eyes.
We can admire his spirit and energy.
The Minor Arcana 13
A Page is a playful child. He acts out the qualities of his suit with pleasure and abandon.
His approach may not be deep, but it is easy, loose, and spontaneous. He is a symbol of ad­
venture and possibility . • • •
You now have a basic idea of the role of each card in the tarot deck. You have a feel for how
they all fit together and what each one contributes to the whole. In the fOllowing lessons, you
will learn more about these cards and how to interpret them in your readings.
lESSON 4
The Spread
A spread is a preset pattern fur laying out the tarot cards. It defines how many cards to use,
where each one goes, and what each one means. A spread is a template guiding the place­
ment of the cards so they can shed light on a given topic. It is within this template that the
meanings of the cards come together so beautifully .
The most important feature of a spread is the fact that each position
has a unique meaning that colors the interpretation of whatever card
fulls in that spot. For example, the Four of Pentacles stands for posses­
siveness, control, and blocked change. If this card were to full in Position
4 of the Celtic Cross Spread (the "Past" position), you would look at
how these qualities are moving out of your life. In Position 6 (the "Fu­
ture"), you would instead view them as coming into your life-a quite
difkrent interpretation .
Tarot spreads can be any size or pattern. Rahdue's Wheel includes
all 78 cards and creates a vast tableau of one person's life.' A spread can
also contain just one card. In lesson 5 I show how a one-card spread is
useful fur daily readings.
Most spreads contain between six and fifteen cards. This range is small enough to be
manageable, but large enough to cover a topic in some depth. The pattern of a spread often
furms a design that refl~cts its theme. For example, the Horoscope Spread is in the shape of
the traditional circle that-furms a person's birth chart.2 The twelve cards of this spread cor­
respond to the twelve houses of astrology.
When cards are related to each other in a spread, an entirely new level of meaning is cre­
ated. Combinations appear, and a story line develops with characters, plots, and themes. The
weaving of a story from the cards in a spread is the most exciting and creative aspect of a tarot
reading. It is an art, but there are many guidelines you can fullow. I discuss these in later les­
sons and give examples of the story-making process.
In these lessons, I refer to just the Celtic Cross Spread. I think you will be able to concen­
trate more on developing your intuition if you stick to just one spread at first. Once you
know the cards well and feel comfurtable reading them, you can expand your tarot practice
by exploring other layouts. Befure continuing with the lessons, become familiar with the
Celtic Cross Spread (see exercise 4.1, p. 70>. We'll be using this spread throughout the course.

The Daily Reading
You are now ready to begin putting your tarot knowledge to work. Lesson 5 describes the
Daily Reading. In this reading, you select a single card that becomes your theme for the day.
The purpose is to heighten your awareness of one approach to life for a single twenty-four­
hour period. It also helps you learn the tarot without strain or tedium.
Let's say you have drawn the Two of Cups for a daily reading. As you
go through the day, you will watch for signs of this card's special energy.
The keywords for the Two of Cups are connection, truce, and attrac­
tion. In the morning, you notice that a colleague , who has been rather
hostile, comes to your office to talk. You sense a TRUCE, and you take
advantage of it. In the afternoon, while working on a problem, you look
for the CONNECTION between two approaches and find your solution.
Later, at a party, you talk to someone who ATTRACTS you. On each oc­
casion, you access the energy of the Two of Cups and allow it to guide
your decisions.
At first, you may want to choose your daily card deliberately so you
can avoid repeat selections and learn the deck more quickly (see exer­
cise 5.1, p. 72). If you prefer, you can choose your card without conscious intervention (see
exercise 5.2, p. 72). Here is the procedure:
I. Shuffle the deck once or twice.
### 2. Hold the deck fuce down in one hand and cover it with your other hand.

### 3. Pause a moment to become calm and centered.

### 4. Ask your Inner Guide to give you the guidance you need for the day.

### 5. Place the deck fuce down in front of you.

### 6. Cut the deck to the left and restack it.

### 7. Turn over the top card as your card of the day.

### 8. Return this card to the deck, and shuffle once or twice.

This procedure is easy to do on a daily basis, and it gives you an opportunity to connect with
your Inner Guide regularly. Choose a time that works for you. Mornings are good because
you can pick a card during your wake-up routine. You can also select one at night. You will
be ready to put your card to use as soon as you wake up. It isn't necessary to pick one time
since your schedule may change. The main goal is to make the Daily Reading a part of your
day so that your tarot work progresses .
Keep a journal of your selections. Later, you will find it interesting to trace the pattern of
your choices. I started studying the tarot in earnest when I was spending my days caring for
my two boys, then under five. One day I calculated the distribution of my daily cards to that
point and found the following :
16 Learning the Tarot
• Wands-24
• Cups-44
• Swords-41
• Pentacles-57
• Major Arcana-56
How clearly this describes my life at that time-heavy on the real world (Pentacles) and ba­
sic forces (major arcana) and not so heavy on individual creativity (Wands).
In your journal, jot down a few highlights of the day next to your entry. This will help you
correlate the cards with your moods and activities; but keep it simple, or you will soon tire
of the effOrt.
I wrote my journal entries using five pens of different colors, one fOr each category:
• Wands = Red (Fire, passion)
• Cups = Blue (Water, moods, emotion)
• Swords= Yellow (Air, mentality)
• Pentacles = Green (Earth, growth, plants, nature, money)
• Major Arcana = Purple (spirituality, higher purpose)
Color coding helps you see at a glance the shifting tarot patterns of your weeks and months.
You will probably be surprised to find that you draw certain cards over and over.
Of the fifty-seven Pentacles I recorded early on, I drew the Ace and Queen eleven times each 1
At home with my children, so many of my days reflected the themes of these two cards. The
Queen of Pentacles is the ultimate nurturing mother. The Ace of Pentacles offers opportuni­
ties to enjoy the material side of life, and it doesn't get more material than cleaning dirty
diapers!
I picked these two cards so often that I became suspicious about them. I examined them
closely one day to see if I had damaged them in such a way that I would be more likely to
select them. They appeared no different from the others. I was simply drawn to them because
they expressed my situation at that time. The cards you select frequently will also tell you
about your concerns.
The most important step in learning the tarot is to take the cards out of the box regularly.
The Daily Reading is the ideal solution. If you do one each day, you will absorb the charac­
ter of each card quickly and easily.
lESSON 6
The Environment
The environment of a tarot reading includes the physical setting and your internal state.
There are five inner qualities that are beneficial. These are:
Being Open. Being open means being receptive. It is an attitude of allowing-being will­
ing to take in what is offered without denial or rejection. By being open, you give
yourself the chance to receive what you need to know.
Being Calm. It is hard to hear the whispers of your Inner Guide when you are in turmoil.
Tarot messages often arrive as gentle hints and realizations that can be easily over­
whelmed by a restless mind. When you are calm, you are like a peaceful sea in
which every ripple of insight can be perceived.
Being Focused. Focus is very important for a tarot reading. I have found that when I feel a
question strongly. I receive a direct and powerful message. When I'm scattered and
confused, the cards tend to be the same. Your most insightful readings will be those
you do when the desire is very strong.
Being Alert. When you are alert, all your faculties are alive and awake. A cat is alert when
it is watching a mouse or bug. Of course, you won't be stalking your cards, but you
will find them difficult to read if you are tired or bqred.
Being Respectful. Being respectful means treating the cards as you would any valued tool.
You acknowledge their role in helping you understand yourself better. You honor
the choice you have made in deciding to learn the tarot, and handle the cards ac­
cordingly.
Even though these five qualities are important, they are not necessary. You can have a mean­
ingful reading without them, but it may be more difficult. The best way to decide if the time
is right for a reading is to look inside. If something feels wrong, postpone the effOrt, but if your
inner sense says go ahead, then all is well.
Besides the inner environment, there is the setting of a reading to consider. The ideal place
is one that elicits feelings of quiet, peace, even reverence . You could do a reading in a crowded
airport, but the noise and distractions would make inner attunement difficult. Since you will
probably be doing most of your readings at home, let's look at how you might create an
agreeable environment there.
Set aside a place in your home where you will do your readings. By using the same spot
over and over, you build up an energy that reinforces your practice. If you meditate or pray.
you can do these activities here as well, as they harmonize with the tarot in spirit and intent.
Try to create a sense of separateness about your spot. When you use the cards, you want
to turn away from the everyday world and go into a space that is outside time and the nor­
mal flow of events. A separate room is ideal, but a corner set off by a screen, curtain, pillows,
or other divider can work too.
18 Learning the Tarot
Try also to create an atmosphere of beauty and meaning. Place some items nearby that are
special to you. Objects from nature, such as shells, stones, crystals, and plants are always ap­
propriate . A talisman, figure, or religious icon may help you shift your fOcus from the mun­
dane to the inspirational. Consider pictures and artwork, especially your own, and appeal to
your senses with such items as flowers, incense, candles, textured materials, and quiet, medi­
tative music.
These touches are nice, but all you really need is a space large enough to lay out the cards.
You can use a table or the floor. There is a grounded feeling to the floor, but, if that position
is uncomfOrtable, a table is better. Choose a table of natural materials such as wood or stone.
If you like, you can cover the table or floor with a cloth to create a unifOrm area. The ma­
terial should be natural, such as silk, cotton, wool, or linen. Choose the color with care as
colors have their own energies. Black, dark blue, and purple are good choices. There should
be little or no pattern, so the images on the cards stand out from the background .
Store your cards in a container to protect them and contain their energies. Any natural
substance is fine, such as wood, stone, shell, or a natural cloth. I know of one woman who
sewed herself a silk, drawstring bag and embroidered it with stars, moons, and other designs.
Consider keeping your cards wrapped in silk cloth when inside their container. Silk has a
luxurious feel that will remind you of the value you place on your cards.
Tarot cards pick up the energy and character of those who use them. For this reason, set
aside a tarot deck that is just fOr you, if you can. These cards are going to be your personal
tool of communication with your Inner Guide. You want to bond to them closely.
When you do your tarot work in a place of your own, the experience can be quite pow­
erful, but extra preparations are never necessary. All you have to do is use the cards. That's
the important part.
lESSON 7
Writing a Question
Most of the time you will consult the tarot because you are facing a problem or challenge.
Something about your life is troubling you, and you want to understand why it is happen­
ing and what you can do about it. The best kind of tarot reading for this situation is the
Question Reading. You write a question about your problem, and you receive your answer
by interpreting the cards. The question helps you relate the guidance you receive to your
situation in a way that makes sense. In this lesson, I describe how to create a question for a
reading you do for yourself
The first step is to review your situation thoroughly. Think about all the people involved,
directly or indirectly. Go over your options for the future. Let your mind wander freely. You
want to look at your problem without judging or censoring any part . .lot down the ideas that
occur to you, but try not to be too systematic. You want to use your intuition, not logical
analysis.
Once you have finished your review, you can write your question. Here are some suggestions.
Accept Responsibility
Write your tarot question to show that you accept responsibility for your situation. Consider
these two questions:
### 1. Should I put my father in a nursing home, or take care of him in my house?

2. What do I need to know to decide on the best living arrangements for my father?
In the first question, the writer gives up her responsibility for making a decision. She wants
the cards to tell her what to do. In the second question, she is simply asking the cards·for
more information. She knows the decision lies with her.
It's tempting to write the first kind of question. We all seek the certainty that we're mak­
ing good choices, but, the tarot can't make our decisions for us. Avoid questions that deflect
responsibility, such as:
### 1. Questions to be answered "Yes" or "No"

Will I get the job at the ad agency?
Can I stick to my diet this month?
Am I ready to retire?
### 2. Questions beginning with "Should ... "

Should I let my daughter live at home?
Should I go out with .Jose?
Should I apply to more than one university?
### 3. Questions asking only about time

When will George ask me to marry him?
20 Learning the Tarot
How long will it take to find a new car?
When will I get my promotion?
Instead, begin your questions with phrases such as:
Can you give me insight into ...
What do I need to understand about ...
What is the meaning of ...
What is the lesson or purpose of ...
What are the circumstances underlying ...
How can I improve my chances of ...
How might I ...
Keep Your Options Open
Write your question to show that you are keeping your options open. Consider these:
I. How might I encourage my mother-in-law to move out?
### 2. What do I need to know to get along better with my mother-in-law?

In the first question, the writer is not keeping his options open. He has decided on one solu­
tion-having his mother-in-law move out. The second question is more open-ended. It's OK
to narrow the scope of a question as long as you don't decide on the answer ahead of time.
Both of the fOllowing are open questions, but the second is more specific:
I. How would a switch to sales impact my career?
### 2. How would a switch to a sales position at Purdue Insurance impact my career?

Find the Best Level of Detail
Seek the fine line between wording that is too vague and too detailed. Here are three ques­
tions on the same topic:
I. How can I improve my work situation?
### 2. How can I reorganize my desk so that Tom can find my files?

### 3. How can I improve the flow of work between Tom and me?

The first question is unfOcused. It doesn't specifY which work area is of interest. The second
question is too detailed. It looks at one minor aspect of the problem. The third question is
best because it finds the balance between the two. Include only the details necessary to make
clear what you want to know.
Focus On Yourself
When you do a reading fur yoursel£ you are always the central character. Your question
should fOcus on you. There are times when questions about others are fine (see Lesson 9),
but not when you are concentrating on your own concerns.
Sometimes you may not realize you are orienting your question around someone else.
Consider these:
I. What is behind Arthur's drinking problem?
### 2. How can I assist Arthur with his drinking problem?

### 3. What role do I play in Arthur's drinking problem?

Writing a Question 21
The first question fOcuses totally on Arthur and his problem. In the second question, the
writer is included, but his attention is still on Arthur. The third question is best because it is
grounded solidly in the writer's own experience .
Stay Neutral
Stay as neutral as possible when writing your questions. It is easy to begin a reading con­
vinced that your position is the right one, but if you truly want to receive guidance, you need
to be open to other points of view. Consider these sets of questions :
I. Why am I the only one doing chores?
### 2. How can I fOster a spirit of cooperation concerning the chores?

I. How can I make people listen when I'm talking?
2. What is going on when I try to communicate, but feel others aren't listening?
I. How can I make my boss stop asking me to do overtime?
### 2. Why have I had to do so much overtime recently 7

In the first questions, the writer feels his position is the correct one-others are not getting
with the program~ The second questions are more neutral and open-ended.
Be Positive
Be positive when writing your questions. Consider these:
I. How come I can never get my research published?
### 2. How can I find the ideal fOrum in which to publish my research?

I. Why can't I overcome my fear of public speaking?
### 2. How can I improve my ability to speak to groups effectively?

I. Can you help me understand why I always blow a tournament in the last round?
### 2. Can you help me find a way to push on to victory in a tournament?

The first questions have an air of defeat. The second questions are more confident. The writer
knows she will be successful given useful advice.
• • •
You may be wondering why I have gone into so much detail about writing a question. This
process is a fOcusing exercise that prepares you fOr the reading that fOllows. Writing a ques­
tion usually takes no more than three or fOur minutes, but, fOr that small investment in time,
you reap big rewards. You understand your situation better and can interpret your reading
with more insight.
lESSON 8
The Question Reading
In this lesson, you will finally learn how to do a full tarot reading for yourself I describe a
simple procedure you can use to explore a personal question. Having a procedure to fOllow
is important in tarot work. When you follow the same steps over and over in a certain
way, they help you center yourself in the moment. The details of the steps are not that im­
portant; in fact, you can change any of them if you wish. The goal is to maintain a spirit of
mindfuln ess. Doing a reading with loving concentration will make your tarot practice very
powerful.
Here is the procedure for a Question Tarot Reading. (See Appendix F for a step-by-step
outline.)
Setting the Mood
Your first step is to create a conducive mood. Lesson 6 offers some suggestions on how to set
up a pleasing environment. You can try these ideas, if you like. Focus on what will make you
feel comfortable and secure.
When you are ready. sit down on the floor or at a table leaving some empty space in front
of you. You should have your tarot cards and your question written on a piece of paper. (See
lesson 7 for how to write a question.) At first, a full reading will probably take at least thirty
to forty minutes. Try to arrange your affuirs so you won't be interrupted. With experience,
you will be able to shorten this time, if you wish, but it is always better to feel unhurried .
Begin to relax and still your mind. Put aside your worries and concerns for now. (You can
always get them back later~) Settle fully into the present moment. Take a few deep breaths,
relax all your muscles, and feel the quiet as you turn away from the outside world. Take as
much time as you need for this calming process.
Asking Your Question
When you feel centered, take your cards out of their container. Hold them cupped in one
hand while you place the other hand on top. Close your eyes and bring the cards into the
circle of your energy.
Now, make an opening statement, if you wish. Some possibiliti es are:
a prayer;
an affirmation;
a description of how you are feeling;
a simple hello to your Inner Guide.
You can write a phrase to say every time, or you can speak spontaneously. It is more impor­
tant to speak from your heart than to mouth an empty fOrmula. Say your statement out loud,
as sound adds energy and conviction.
The Question Reading 23
Next, ask your question, either fi-om memory or by reading it. Be sure to say your question
exactly as you wrote it. One of the mysteries of the unconscious is that it is very literal; the
cards you choose will often reflect the precise wording of your question.
Shuffling the Cards
Open your eyes and begin shuffling. It is important to shuffle the cards because this is how
you sort through all the forms your reading could take and arrange at a subtle level the one
you will receive.
There are a number of ways to shuffle the cards. Each method has its pros and cons.
Choose one that is most comfortable for you. (See appendix E for some shuffling choices.)
Certain methods mix the cards so some are right side up (upright) and some, upside-down
(reversed). If this is your first reading, do not worry about reversed cards. I will explain these
in lesson 1 7.
Concentrate on your question while you shuffle. Focus on the overall intent rather than
the details. Don't strain to stay fixed, but do keep the question in mind as much as you can.
Cutting the Cards
When you feel you have shuffled long enough, stop and place the cards fuce down in fi-ont
of you with the short edge closest to you. Cut the deck as follows:
3 2 1
### 1. Grab some number of cards fi-om the complete pile.

### 2. Drop this smaller pile to the left.

### 3. Grab some part of this second pile and drop it further to the left.

### 4. Regroup the cards into one pile in any fashion.

It's best to regroup the cards in one quick motion. Don't try to figure out which pile should
go where. Just let your hand move where it will. The cut is an important finjshing step that
marks the end of the card-arranging stage. Once you have regrouped the cards, the pattern
of the reading is fixed, and all that remains is to lay out the cards and see what they reveal.
Laying Out the Cards
Follow the steps for the spread you have chosen. If this is your first reading, use the Celtic
Cross. <Before actually laying out the cards, read the next step, "Responding to the Cards.")
24
l. Pick up the deck and hold it in one hand with the short edge closest to you.
2. With your other hand, turn over the first card as you would the page of a book.
3. Place this card in Position l. (The position number corresponds to the placement
order.)
### 4. Turn over the second card, and place it in Position 2.

### 5. Continue in this way until you have placed all the cards.

### 6. Turn any reversed cards around if you are not using them.

Responding to the Cards
Pay attention to your reactions to each card as you lay it out. At first, you will not know or
remember the usual meaning of a card. Your thoughts and feelings will be based mainly on
the images. As you practice, your reactions will become more infOrmed , but also more pre­
dictable. Try to keep some of your original openness as much as possible. Pay attention to any
responses that seem unusual or out of place.
When all the cards are laid out, take a moment to respond to them as a whole. Do you
get an overall impression? Do you have any new reactions? Jot down some of your thoughts,
if you wish. Don't worry if you can't remember all of them. Just as with dreams, you will
recall the most important . Try not to get too involved in your notes as that can break the
flow of the reading. You simply want to capture a few ideas quickly.
Analyzing the Cards
In the beginning, use the section about individual cards fOr help. Later, you can examine the
cards on your own, but you may still find this section useful. (I use it myself from time to
time~)
Begin your review with Position 1 and proceed in position order. Here are the suggested
steps:
l. Look up the card in section 4.
### 2. Read through all the keywords and actions.

3. Look fOr actions that make you say "Yes, that one really fitsY' I experience a kind of jolt
of recognition when I see one. Don't shy away from actions that seem less pleasant.
Trust your reactions, and reserve judgment until you've seen all the cards. Note any
stray thoughts or "irrelevant" feelings that come to mind.
When you've considered each card, look fOr relationships between them. Apply the prin­
ciples of interpretation. (These are covered in lessons 11-18.)
You could ponder a reading fOr hours without running out of insights, but, of course, this
isn't practical or desirable. Do try to spend some time, however. Your reward will be equal
to your effort.
Creating the Story
At some point, you need to pull everything together. I call this creating the story (see lesson
18). Your story will help you understand your situation and give you guidance fOr the fu­
ture-what you have been seeking all along.
I recommend that you create your story spontaneously. Once you have finished your card
review, let that analytical approach go. It's no longer appropriate . Your story will be more au-
The Question Reading 25
thentic if it arises fi-eely fi-om within. When you feel ready, simply begin speaking your story,
saying whatever comes to mind. Use any notes you have to help, but don't fucus on them
too much.
I encourage you to tell your story out loud. Writing is too slow, and just thinking your
ideas is too vague. Your story will gather strength and power as it is spoken. If you begin to
ramble or lose your train of thought, don't be concerned. Simply pause, regroup, and start
again. As you practice, you will get better at speaking on the Ay. You may want to tape your
story. When you play back the tape, you will be amazed at what you hear. You will truly feel
you are your own best tarot reader.
Writing the Summary Statement
Your story is done when your words slow down and stop naturally. Your next step is to dis­
till the main theme of your story. What is the essence of your guidance? Ask yourself these
kinds of questions:
What is the problem or conflict?
What is my role 7
What does my Inner Guide want me to understand?
What is the projected outcome 7
How do you feel about that'
Do I sense any recommendations fur action?
What you are doing is forming the answer to your question. Before the reading, you posed
a question that had meaning fur you. Your Inner Guide has responded, and now you want
to capture that wisdom in a form you can remember. Try to summarize your story in one
or two sentences. Concentrate on the message in the cards and not the mechanics of your
interpretation.
Finishing Vp
The main event is over, but as with any ceremony, there are a few final steps to take to end
your reading and leave your cards ready for next time.
If you have not already done so, write down the cards you selected and their positions. It is
easy to fOrget them. Then, clear the deck to remove all traces of the energy patterns of this read­
ing. I clear a deck by scrambling the cards together gently. It reminds me of erasing letters in
the sand with a sweep of my hand. You may enjoy this technique as well, but any shuffling
method will do (see Appendix E). Take a few moments now to clear your deck. Make sure the
cards are face down or turned away fi-om you. Stop when you feel you've shuffled long enough,
and gather the cards together. Your deck is ready fur your next reading.
BefOre putting the cards away, hold them again for just a moment. Place your deck in one
hand with the other hand on top, and close your eyes. Say what you feel you have learned
fi-om this reading. Express your gratitude to your Inner Guide fur helping you via the tarot
cards. Gratitude is a wonderful sentiment. It provides the ideal fi-ame of mind in which to end
your reading.
When you began, you initiated a cycle. You created meaning in the furm of a reading, and
now you have completed that cycle by returning the cards to their resting state.
26 Learning the Tarot
Using What You Have Learned
The reading proper is over, but the inner work is just beginning . Your goal is to integrate
what you have learned into your life in some way. If you don't, your tarot practice will remain
a beautiful pastime with no power to help you.
Decide on one or more actions you can take to put your guidance to work. You can rein­
fOrce what you're doing now or make some changes, either radical or minor. Specific actions
are usually more helpful than vague plans.
If you are keeping a journal, write down what you intend to do. Commit only to what you
know you will actually carry out. I know how easy it is to lay out some cards, look at them
briefly and then never think about that reading again, especially when your reaction is less
than positive!
As the days go by. think about your reading and how it meshes with your life. Ask your-
self these questions:
How meaningful was my story?
How well did the guidance fit?
Did I miss any clues?
Did I carry out an action, and, if so, what happened?
Did something unexpected occur?
Can my Daily Readings add anything?
You may be tempted to do another reading, but it's probably best to wait until there are im­
portant changes in your situation. Assume that your first reading covers all you need to know.
If you are puzzled about certain elements, mine your first reading for more insights. By
going deeper, you will get closer to the heart of the matter.
Using what you have learned in a reading is probably the most important step-and the
most difficult. It involves moving beyond playing with the cards. When you actually commit
to integrating your tarot insights into your life, you have realized the true and lasting ben­
efit to be gained from the cards.
This is my ideal tarot session, but, to be truthful, I don't always fOllow it. Sometimes I lin­
ger over these steps, sometimes I neglect quite a few of them. I encourage you to adopt
whatever procedure suits your interests and needs. If you don't enjoy the cards, they'll just
gather dust on the shelf The details aren't that important; it's the intention that counts!
lESSON 9
The Other Reading
You can do a tarot reading that is centered on another person or subject. I call this the Other
Reading. An Other Reading is appropriate whenever you are simply curious about someone
or something that doesn't involve you directly. Other Readings are about someone, not for
him or her. When a reading is fur someone, that person writes the question and you simply
help interpret the cards.
Other Readings are fun and infOrmative . They are also a good way to learn the tarot. When
you use the cards fur yourself. you only get to look at a limited set of problems-your own~
Other Readings let you explore much more.
Except fur choosing the subject, the procedure fur an Other Reading is basically the same
as the one in lesson 8. The few differences are noted below. (See Appendix G fur a step-by­
step outline.)
l. Your first step is to decide on the subject of your reading. You can fucus on just about
anything-a person, animal, place, problem, or news event-as long as you identifY the
subject ahead of time. Usually it will be the central figure in a situation, but it doesn't
have to be.
Your subject can be a group entity, such as a marriage, family, team, or neighborhood.
You can fucus on a country or the Earth, but fur such large entities, the infOrmation will
be very general.
You may be tempted to do an Other Reading about someone who is close to you­
a relative, friend, or colleague. In lesson 7 I talk about the importance of fOcusing on
yourself in readings that concern you. Here is a simple test you can take to decide
whether an Other Reading is advisable. Ask yourself three questions:
Do I feel strong emotions when I think about this person in this situation7
Do I have a vested interest in this situation?
Do I desire a particular outcome in this situation?
If your answer is yes to any of these questions, you should probably do a reading cen­
tered on yourself rather than an Other Reading.
You now need to write a question. Follow the suggestions in lesson 7. but write the
question about your subject. Focus on the aspect of your subject that interests you. If
you are wondering about a politician who is running fur president, your question might
be: "What are the factors impacting Mr. or Ms. Candidate's chances to become the next
president?"
2. When setting the mood, place a picture of your subject nearby to help you fucus
during your reading. An object that reminds you of your subject works well too.
3. When asking your question, say something about the other person or why you are
28 Learning the Tarot
doing an Other Reading. Request guidance that is in the best interest of all concerned,
and mention that you hold only good intentions toward your subject. Of you can't say
this truthfully, consider a reading fOr yourself insteadn
4. As you respond to the cards, remember they refer to the other person, not to you.
However, don't be surprised if you see in the cards some interesting correspondences
with your own lifel
5. When analyzing the cards, in an Other Reading, you are seeing the situation from your
own point of view. What you see in the cards may or may not be related to what the
subject actually experiences .
6. Even though an Other Reading fOcuses on someone else, there is still a lesson fOr you
in the cards. Try to identifY this lesson so you can apply it in your own life.
## Lesson 10

The Open Reading
An Open Reading is a request for guidance that is not tied to a particular problem. You don't
write a question. You simply give your Inner Guide an opportunity to communicate what
you most need to know at a given moment.
For most occasions the Question Reading is the best type because it zeroes in on the is­
sue that is most important to you . .lust as with the telephoto lens of a camera, a question lets
you move in to focus more narrowly on a subject, but it also keeps you from seeing the big­
ger picture. An Open Reading has more scope. It covers your long-term growth and devel­
opment. It offers a higher level of guidance that embraces the larger patterns that are shap­
ing your everyday experiences.
Open Readings can be quite powerful. I try to use them sparingly to preserve their out­
of-the-ordinary quality. Consider them for special occasions, such as: birthdays, anniversaries,
ceremonial days, equinoxes, and first days (new job, date, trip).
Open Readings are useful when you are standing on the threshold of a new phase, such
as after the birth of a child or move to a new house. Open Readings can help you adjust to
new or unpredictable situations ahead of time. Whenever an expanse of unknown is open­
ing out before you, that is a perfect time fOr an Open Reading.
The procedure is basically the same as the one in lesson 8. The few differences are noted
below. (See Appendix H for a step-by-step outline.)
I. To prepare for an Open Reading, you want to avoid the analysis that goes into writing
a question. Simply let your mind empty of all cares and concerns. There is nothing you
have to do or arrange except a gentle quieting of the mind.
2. Instead of reading a question, say a more general message of intent such as: I welcome
a message of wisdom and open myself to receive the guidance that I most need at this
time. You can narrow the focus a little as long as you avoid specific people and events.
If you're interested in your health, you can add a phrase to that effect: I welcome a mes­
sage of wisdom about my health and open myself to receive the guidance that I most
need at this time.
3. Keep your mind free and open while you shuffle. If a thought drifts by. let it gently pass
without fixing on it. Ideally, you should feel like an empty house with all the windows
open to every soft breeze.
4. As a rule, when analyzing the cards, you want to step back from the details of your life
and let the cards show you the larger themes. Concentrate on the patterns as revealed
in the reading. View everything in a wider context. Open Readings are not about the
everyday.
5. It is not necessary to commit to specific actions. Simply absorb the spirit of the message
and allow it to guide you in a general way.
## Part 2

[I)
Principles of Interpretation
Introduction
You're seated in front of your first tarot reading. You've shuffied, cut, and laid out ten cards
fur the Celtic Cross. Your first thought is probably, "Now, what do I do?"
When I first began learning the tarot, I sought the answer to this question everywhere­
in classes, conversations , books, and practice. I was looking fur the one, true way to interpret
the cards. Of course, I never fOund such a system because it doesn't exist. Reading the tarot is
an art, not a science. There can be no set rules that apply all the time because every person
is unique. How could a set of fOrmulas ever provide guidance that honors that uniqueness?
On the other hand, there are some ways to approach the cards that have proven valuable
time and again. They work because they bring fOrm and fOcus to intuitive responses . They
provide a framework around which you can build the special message of each reading.
In the next nine lessons, I share some of the principles of interpretation that I have discov­
ered. I ofkr these as guidelines to help you develop a feel fur readings and what they can tell
you. Take from them what works fur you and use them to create a tarot approach that is
uniquely your own.
## Lesson 11

Interpreting a Single Card
When I interpret a reading, I go back and forth between sensing the cards as a whole and
examining each one individually. The two approaches reinforce each other. In this lesson, we
will look at how to interpret one card in a reading on its own. There are four sources of
meaning:
I. The Brst is your unique response to a card based on your background, personality. and
state of mind. This element keeps the meaning of the card personal and fresh.
2. The second is the set of meanings that have built up around a card over the years. These
vary with different tarot writers and teachers. My suggestions for each card are given
in section 4.
3. The third is the set of meanings associated with the position of a card. These are also
based on convention and common experience. My suggestions for the Celtic Cross are
given in section 5.
4. The fourth is your question or life circumstances. This element provides a framework
for your responses. It sets boundaries and helps you relate a card to one area of your
life.
To interpret a card, you need to combine these four sources of meaning into some compos­
ite that makes sense to you. This is a fluid process. These areas seem separate, but in prac­
tice, they blend together, and your response just happens.
At Brst, you will probably rely on the card and position meanings to
guide you. Later, your personal reactions will be more important. Your
reaction may be triggered by a card's image. The scenes on the cards
can seem to relate to your situation very directly. For example, if you
are building a house, the document on the Three of Pentacles may
strike you as a set of blueprints .
Assume that you have drawn the upright Seven of Cups in Position
### 5. Your question is: "How can I improve my chances of receiving a bo­

nus this year?"
To begin reviewing this card, you would Brst note your reactions.
Perhaps your glance falls on the cup Blled with jewels. The flgure in the
foreground seems to be looking directly at this cup. You identify with
him as he reaches out for treasure. This flts your question-you're reaching out for a bonus.
Next, you look at the keywords for the Seven of Cups. They are:
wishful thinking
options
dissipation
Interpreting a Single Card
When you read through the actions, you are struck by the following:
kidding yourself about the facts
waiting fur your ship to come in
lacking focus and commitment
These phrases suggest someone who is passive and unrealisti c, who
lacks the energy and desire for success. They reinforce the idea of wish­
ful thinking.
On reading over the meanings for Position 5, you feel a pull toward:
your delusions and illusions
what you're obsessed about
what you've set your heart on 35
The sense of this card is beginning to take shape for you. The card seems to be suggesting
that you are too busy daydreaming to act constructively. The figure now strikes you as awed
by the cup dangled in front of him. You decide that this card represents fur you at this time
an attitude of unreasonable hopes and unproductive dreaming. This is your first feeling about
what the card is saying. You may modifY that assessment later when you examine the other
cards.
Clearly there are other possibilities. You might have been struck by the array of delights
floating in front of the shadowy figure. He seems to have many options, another meaning of
the Seven of Cups.
There is never just one right answer in tarot work1 Both of these interpretations make
sense. You may wonder how you can decide on the best meaning when there are so many
possibilities. You must trust your intuition. Your Inner Guide will give you hints that will lead
you toward the ideas that are most important for you. An insistent thought may keep pop­
ping into your mind. You may circle around a meaning-thinking about it, moving off, then
finally coming back. When one meaning hits you with particular force, you know you're
on the right track. This is the "Aha" reaction. An "Aha" reaction may not happen fur every
card, but when it does, you know it is important. These are the ways that inner knowing
manifests .
## Lesson 12

Major and Minor Arcana Cards
Certain cards in the tarot naturally form into groups. These cards have unique meanings, but
they also have a common identity with the other cards in their group. The two largest sub­
groups are the major and minor arcanas. The terms major and minor reflect the relative
weights of these two groups.
A major arcana card represents an energy that is deep, strong, decisive, or long-term. When
a major arcana card appears in a reading, you have tapped into a powerful energy in some area
of your life. The minor arcana cards do not carry the same weight, but they are still impor­
tant. They chart the ups and downs of daily life and register changes in feelings and thoughts .
These dramas are gripping while they occur, but they pass with time as new concerns take
their place.
Compare the interpretation of two cards with similar meanings, but different weights-the
Hermit (major) and the Eight of Cups (minor). The Hermit is the archetypal symbol of one
who seeks truth and deeper meaning. He stands fur the impulse to renounce superficial plea­
sures to seek understanding within. In a reading, the Hermit could hint that you are feeling
a strong urge to find answers even if it means giving up aspects of your current way of life.
This is not a passing fancy, but a major desire that could last fur some time.
With the Eight of Cups, your interpretation might be much the same, but, as a minor
arcana card, this card implies your search does not have the same force. Maybe you've been
a little bored at work. Some days you feel like chucking everything to go make hats on the
beach, but you don't really mean it. You are seeking, but the urge is not yet a heartfelt
desire.
Let's say you have been happily married for many years, but suddenly find yourself at­
tracted to an acquaintance. You consult the tarot and draw the Two of Cups in Position I.
One of the meanings of this card is attraction-being drawn toward a person, place, or idea
Major and Minor Arcana Cards
that is pleasing. As a minor arcana card, the Two
of Cups tells you your attraction is probably
based on surface elements such as common inter­
ests or sexual desire. The feelings are strong, but
they're mainly coming from the give-and-take of
everyday adventure-for now.
If you had drawn the Lovers instead, yo u would
have to give this attraction greater weight. As a
major arcana card, the Lovers implies this relation­
ship is not simple. The attraction is coming from a
deeper place. There are elements that go beyond
the casual and require more understanding. 37
You could draw a minor arcana card in one reading and then draw a major arcana card
about the same subject in a later reading. What started as minor has become more impor­
tant over time. Similarly. a major matter can fade and lose its urgency as your life changes.
You can assume that a major arcana card brings greater energy to whatever area it represent s.
Give that aspect extra consideration and take advantage of the power building there.
lESSON 13
Aces
Each Ace represents the qualities of its suit in their purest furm. An Ace always adds some­
thing special to a reading. It stands out from the other cards as if in a circle of its own light.
The images on the Aces are all similar. A strong hand, glowing with energy, comes out of a
cloud grasping the token of its suit. An Ace "hands" you a gift that comes from some un­
known source hidden in the clouds. The nature of the gift is symbolized by the suit token.
Ace of Wands
A wand is a strong, masculine object, alive with
potent fOrce. Leaves are growing as new life
bursts forth. The wand reminds us of a magic
wand used to perfOrm miracles and create won­
ders. The gift of the Ace of Wands is creativity.
enthusiasm, courage, and confidence.
Ace of Cups
A cup is an open, feminine object-a receptacle
designed to hold nourishing liquids. Water pours
from the cup showing there is a never-ending
supply of refreshment flowing into the world.
The gift of the Ace of Cups is emotion, intuition,
intimacy. and love.
Ace of Swords
A sword is a weapon-a finely crafted tool to cut
through any obstacle or confusion. A sword ex­
tends the power of its user to fight and prevail. It
can wield a cruel fOrce, but also a clean, sharp one.
The gift of the Ace of Swords is mental clarity.
truth, justice, and fOrtitude.
Ace of Pentacles
The pentacle is a magical sign fur the mystery of nature and the every­
day world. It is stamped on a coin, the token of material exchange. With
money and raw materials, we have the wherewithal to make our
dreams real. The gift of the Ace of Pentacles is prosperity. practicality.
security, and the ability to manifest.
Aces 39
Aces are portals between the realms of the major and minor arcanas. They allow powerful.
but impersonal fOrces to come into your life. An Ace in a reading shows that its qualities are
becoming available to you. If you take advantage of them, you will achieve greater happiness
and success. An Ace is always interpreted as beneficial. positive, and life-enhancing.
An Ace can indicate a new adventure is beginning. I once saw the Ace of Cups in Posi­
tion 1 fur a friend's reading about her new love affair. What better card to signal the begin­
ning oflove and intimacy? (Well ... possibly the Fool, but that's another story!)
An Ace can also represent a window of opportunity that is opening. The Ace tells you
to pay attention so you don't miss it. Think of an Ace as a seed of possibility that will grow
given your attention and care.
A relative once drew the Ace of Pentacles in Position 1 and the Ace of Wands in Position
2-a dynamic combination that says "Look fur a real. creative outlet fur your energies that
will bring greater prosperity ." Several months later, she told me that-encouraged by this
sign-she pursued a challenging opening at her workplace and was now making more money
with greater personal satisfaction.
When you are working with an Ace, look fur the potential in every situation. See how you
might take advantage of whatever comes your way because you will have the chance to make
real and important changes in your life.
## Lesson 14

Court Cards
You have probably noticed that people tend to full into types. Their traits cluster together
in familiar ways. We sometimes give these clusters names, such as "loner," "dreamer," or "life
of the party." Psychologists have devised elaborate systems that categorize types of people.
The popular Myers-Briggs is one such system.1
The tarot has its own system of personalities represented by the 16 court cards-the King,
Queen, Knight, and Page of each suit. In lesson 3, you learned about the fOur suits and court
card ranks. These are the keys to understanding the court cards because the personality of
each one is a combination of its suit and rank.
Kings
The King of Wands is creative, inspiring, fOrceful, charismatic, and bold.
These are typical positive traits of the Wands suit. They are prime ex­
amples of its dynamic fire energy. but they also reflect the character of
a King. Kings are active and outgoing. They want to make an impact on
the world through the fOrce of their personality.
Queens
The Queen of Wands is attractive, wholehearted,
energetic, cheerful, and self-assured. These are also
Wands qualities. This Queen is upbeat and lively.
but she does not wield her personality as a fOrce di­
rected outward. Queens express their suits from
the inside, setting a tone without imposing it.
Knights
Knights are extremists; they express their suit
qualities to the maximum. Such excessive feelings
and behavior can be either positive or negative
depending on the circumstances.
For example, the Knight of Pentacles has an excess of caution-a
trait typical of the steady. conservative Pentacles nature. This Knight
prefers to check and double-check everything . He always proceeds
slowly befOre committing himself-the kind of person you would ask
to fOld your parachute or guide you through a mine field.
I. l. B. Myers. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press. 1962).
Court Cards
On the other hand, you could also say the Knight of Pentacles is
unadventurous. He will never double his money in two months
through a risky investment or propose a surprise trip to Paris on a
whim. Such daring moves are not in his nature. You would have to
check with the Knight of Wands for that1
The keywords for the Knights are positive and negative word pairs
(cautious/unadventurous). In readings, you must consider both views
when interpreting a Knight. Does he represent a beneficial or harmful
approach? The other factors (and your own honestyD will help you
decide.
Pages 41
Each Page shows a happy child holding the token of his suit. He is fascinated by his plaything.
The Pages inspire us to enjoy their interests with them. The Page of Swords can represent
the thrill of intellectual discovery or other mental challenges.
Pages also encourage you to "Go for it1" Children do not hesitate when they want some­
thing. They reach out and grab. If you want what the Page is offering, don't be afraid. Seize
the day~
If the Page of Cups is your card of the day, and a fellow student
smiles at you, take this opportunity for friendship. Strike up a conver­
sation or suggest getting a cup of coffee after class. This Page encourages
you to bring love and sharing into your life.
In many tarot systems, the court cards represent people of a certain
age and type. For example, the Queen of Swords is often a divorced
woman. To me, this way of looking at court cards is too limiting. Traits
are not limited to certain groups. The King's approach may be more
typically masculine, but his style is also available to women. Children
are more often playful, but that doesn't mean that a Page must always
represent a child.
A court card in a reading is showing you how a certain approach to life
is (or could be) impacting your situation. There are several possibilities.
First, a court card can show a side of you that is being expressed or
seeking expression . It may be a side you value, or one you neglect. It
may be an approach you recognize, or one you deny. How you view it
depends on your question, the other cards, and the situation.
Let's say you are trying to decide whether or not to enter into a
business partnership . If you draw the King of Swords, you could inter­
pret him as a way for you to act in this situation-t o be fair and ethi­
cal, to review everything carefully, and to articulate your needs. If you
are already taking this approach, the King of Swords affirms your posi­
tion, but, if you are lying or hiding something, this card asks you to re­
consider.
42 Learning the Tarot
A court card can also represent another person. If you look at a
court card and say to yourself. "I know who that is!" then it probably
is that person. It may also represent someone of whom you are not yet
aware.
Let's say you have met someone who is very romantic. You spend
long hours together and connect on a deep level. In a reading, the
Knight of Cups could represent this new lover, but, since he is a Knight,
you should look at this relationship closely.
What are you hoping to experience with your lover? You may be
enjoying the romance, but are you also looking for dependability and
commitment? The Knight of Cups is a signal to you that this relation­
ship may be lopsided: abundant in intimate sharing, but deficient in
other ways.
Finally, a court card can reflect the general atmosphere. Sometimes,
an environment seems to take on a personality of its own-one that
matches a court card type.
Let's say you consulted the tarot to find out about the group house
you just joined and drew the Queen of Pentacles. You wonder if you
will get along with your future housemates. This card could be telling
you that the atmosphere will be nurturing . Your housemates will be
warm and generous with a sensible approach to problems.
On the other hand, you may meet someone in the house who is
similar to the Queen of Pentacles, or you may be like her yourself in
this situation. Such is the subtle play of the tarot!
The court cards have a human dimension that the other cards do
not, so they can give you clear messages about who you are and what you want. The trick is
to understand yourself and the situation so you can accept the messages when they come.
## Lesson 15

Card Pairs
There is a game called Labyrinth that consists of a square box with a platfOrm inside. On the
platform is a maze punctuated by little holes. The object is to move a ball from one end of
the maze to the other without letting it fall into one of the holes. Knobs on the outside let
you guide the ball by rotating the platform in any direction.
A simple game, but difficult in practice1 The slightest miscalculation, and the ball goes
down. If you lean the platform too far in one direction, you lose control. If you try to com­
pensate, you lose control in the other direction. The only strategy that works is a patient
shepherding of the ball along the path as you maintain a balance of movement and force in
all directions.
I see in Labyrinth a metaphor for our navigation along the pathway of life. We travel from
birth to death negotiating around the .:holes" by continually balancing our approaches. We
maintain steady progress forward by making countless li!e adjustments -first here, then there.
Our actions offSet each other in a dance that is sometimes delightful. often challenging.
The key is always balance. To achieve balance, we must know how to express all the en­
ergies available to us. Personal balance is never static. It comes from the ability to choose
dynamically the option th<;~t will work in any given moment.
A tarot reading is a map 'of all the counterbalancing tendencies that are or could be oper­
ating in your life at one time. To read this map, you must understand the Law of Opposi­
tion-that any quality, once identified , implies its opposite. This is a basic principle of the
material universe. The Fool discovers this principle at the very beginning of his journey when
he meets the Magician and the High Priestess. These two show him that nothing can be
defined in isolation, only as one pole of a balancing pair.
At the deepest level. opposition does not exist. There is just Oneness, but, in physicalliie,
we perceive Oneness as broken up into countless different energies. These are the forces we
navigate in our search for balance.
One way to discover balance issues is by looking for two cards in a reading that oppose
each other. One meaning of the Eight of Swords is restriction-being trapped in an oppres­
sive or limiting situation. If you ponder this meaning for awhile, you realize that simply by
acknowledging the idea of restriction, you imply the opposing idea of freedom-the break­
ing out of bonds and limitations. This quality is represented by the Four of Wands.
In a reading, these two cards could be showing you the importance of the restriction/free­
dom issue in your life. They define the extreme ends of a continuum of experience from
which you choose the best balance point for yourself There are three types of card pairs.
44 Learning the Tarot
Permanent pairs. Certain cards form clear
and obvious permanent opposites . The Eight
of Swords and Four of Wands are this type of
pair. The Magician and the High Priestess are
another. The Magician represents action and
conscious awareness; the High Priestess,
nonaction and unconscious awareness.
Court card and Ace pairs. You can create a pair between any two court cards or two Aces.
These pairs reflect the balance patterns that emerge when you contrast two suits or ranks.
Consider the King of Pentacles and the
Queen of Cups. Here are the keywords for
these cards:
King of Pentacles
enterprising
adept
reliable
supporting
steady Queen of Cups
emotional
tenderhearted
intuitive
psychic
spiritual
The King of Pentacles acts outwardly (King) in an enterpnsmg, adept way based on
his interest in the material world (Pentacles). The Queen of Cups has an inner
focus (Queen) that is emotional and intuitive based on her concern with feelings (Cups).
In a reading, this pair could represent a conflict between two people-a can-do type who
wants to get the job done, and a dreamer who first wants to see how everyone feels. This pair
could also represent a dual approach within you-perhaps a need to focus on worldly con­
cerns versus a desire to concentrate on the spiritual. There are many possibilities , all based
on the dynamic between these two styles. Appendices C and 0 describe how the suits and
ranks interact.
Card Pairs 45
Occasional pairs. You can interpret any two
cards as a pair, even if their meanings are not
clearly opposites. There is so much meaning
in every card that usefUl comparisons can al­
most always be m~de. Occasional pairs arise
by chance, and their relationship lasts for
only that one instance.
The Four of Cups shows a solitary man
sitting under a tree. The Ten of Cups shows
a happy family celebrating together. If the
idea were meaningfUl to you, you might see
these cards as defining the opposites of"being alone" versus "being with others." This under­
standing would occur to you out of the blue as a possibility.
Reinforcing Pairs. Two cards do not have to
oppose each other to form a pair. They can
reinfOrce each other. Both the Empress and
the Nine of Cups suggest pleasure, sensuality,
and physical enjoyment. Reinforcing pairs
show that a certain energy is or could be hav­
ing an extra impact. Sometimes we have to
face circumstances in an unbalanced way for
the moment in order to achieve our goals.
Balance issues are everywhere. Your tarot readings will help you identifY them through the
action of card pairs. In the next lesson, we will see how these pairs operate in the Celtic Cross.
## Lesson 16

Position Pairs in the Celtic Cross Spread
The Celtic Cross is a powerful spread because it contains many natural pairings. Certain
positions complement each other, so the cards that fall there relate in meaningful ways.
Position 1 and Position 2-The Core Situation
The l-2 pair is at the very center of the Celtic Cross. These cards fOrm an obvious pair
because Card 2 sits right on top of Card I, turned 90 degrees~ The I-2 pair symbolizes the
heart of a situation. It shows two factors coming together either on a collision course (ex­
ample I) or fOr mutual support (example 2). Sometimes Card l shows the central issue and
Card 2 what you must do about it (example 3).
Examples-Position 1 and Position 2
I. Two Forces Colliding
Sharon 1 asked fOr a reading shortly after she reunited with her boyfiiend. They had bro­
ken up a few weeks befOre because she wanted marriage and children, and he was reluctant.
Now they were engaged. She drew the Ten of Clips as Card l and the Six of Pentacles as Card
2. The Ten of Cups shows the joy of romance and family that is the promise of this couple's
future. Card 2 suggests that there are still issues of give-and-take to work out. The Six of
Pentacles symbolizes the subtle (or not so subtle~) dance of dominance/submission that is a
factor here.
### 2. Two Forces in Mutual Support

Julia did an Open Reading after quitting her job. She felt she was standing at the thresh­
old of a new chapter in her life. She drew the King of Wands as Card I and the Empress as
I. Names used in all the examples in this lesson are not those of the actual participants.
Position Pairs m the Celtic Cross Spread 47
Card 2. This striking pair combines two different, but powerful forces. Julia thought these
cards meant that her future would include both the creative, inspiring energy of this King
and the abundant, nurturing energy of the Empress.
### 3. What Is True and What That Implies

Nancy drew the Page of Swords as Card l and the Nine of Pentacles as Card 2. It turned
out that her 8-year-old granddaughter Rose was much on her mjnd. Rose was quite a hand­
ful. During visits, she was often unruly and impossible to control-a real challenge (Page of
Swords). The Nine of Pentacles told Nancy she would need to enfOrce a lot of discipline if
she wanted to help Rose improve her behavior.
Position 3 and Position 5-Levels of Consciousness
Cards 3 and 5 represent two levels of awareness. You can learn much about a situation by
comparing your innermost knowledge with your conscious attitudes. You can find out:
(example I)
(example 2)
(example 3) Card 3
real feelings
deeper truth
wisdom of higher self Card 5
expected feelings
surface appearances
beliefS of ego-self
48 Learning the Tarot
Examples-Position 3 and Position 5
I. Real Feelings-Expected Feelings
Nicole did a reading to find out what to do about her friend Ann. Ann had asked Nicole
to lie to her (Ann's) ex-husband about where she and their children were. Nicole drew the
Ten of Wands as Card 3 and the Ten of Cups as Card 5. Nicole thought she should provide
love and support to Ann and try to help keep peace in their family (Ten of Cups). At a deeper
level, she was having trouble saying no. She felt burdened by the responsibility of the request
and resented being dragged into this messy situation (Ten of Wands).
y
### 2. Deeper Truth-Surface Appearances

You have just gone through a bitter, unwanted divorce. You do a reading to try to come
to terms with this blow, and you draw the Fool as Card 3 and the Five of Cups as Card 5.
On the surface, you are feeling sad and defeated about your loss, but in fact, this change may
represent an opportunity for you. The Fool suggests you may be on the threshold of a new,
exciting time in your life. Deep inside, your faith in yourself is strong. Your future looks bright
despite this apparent setback.
Position Pairs in the Celtic Cross Spread 49
### 3. Higher Self-Ego-Self

I once did a reading to find out how I could open more to my higher self I drew the
Wheel ofFortune as Card 3 and the Two ofSwords as Card 5. At a spiritual level, the Wheel
of Fortune suggests the mystery behind everyday life. It indicates a mind ready to expand its
personal vision. This card showed that a greater awareness was circling around inside, but I
was blocking it. The Two of Swords told me I was choosing not to accept my inner know­
ing, probably because of my ego's fear.
Position 4 and Position 6-Time
Cards 4 and 6 are mirror images. Time is the theme of these two cards. Card 4 is the past,
Card 6, the near future. Together they form the two halves of the circle of time that sur­
rounds the present (Card I). These cards can show something that is:
(example l)
(example 2)
(example 3) Card 4
movmg away
to be released
already experienced Card 6
approaching
to be embraced
to be experienced
Examples-Position 4 and Position 6
50 Learning the Tarot
### 1. Moving Away-Approaching

Sophia was wondering whether or not to have a third child. She drew the Knight of Cups
as Card 4 and the Page of Cups as Card 6. These two court cards show exactly what would
occur in time if she were to get pregnant. Her emotional (Cups) focus on the older children
(Knight) would recede somewhat as her attention turned toward the baby (Page). The Knight
and Page take on a special meaning here due to the ages they suggest.
### 2. To Be Released-To be Embraced

In a reading about a possible career change, I drew the Seven of Pentacles as Card 4 and
the Eight of Wands as Card 6. The Seven of Pentacles is a card of assessment-the need to
take stock before a decision. Here it suggests that such questioning needs to end. The time
for quick action and conclusion is at hand as shown by the Eight of Wands. This pair seems
to be saying, "OK, you've thought long enough. Just go ahead and make your move, what­
ever it is."
### 3. Already Experienced-To Be Experienced

Jeff had quit his job and was now working part-time while looking for a new position. He
drew the Five of Wands as Card 4 and immediately saw this card as a symbol of the petty
fighting that was rampant at his old company. The antagonistic atmosphere there was one
Pos;t;on Pa;rs ;n the Ce/Hc Cross Spread 51
of the reasons he had left, but Jeff still had another hurdle to face. The Four of Cups as Card
6 suggests he may need to go through a period of withdrawal and introspection before find­
ing the job he is looking for.
Position 7 and Position 8-Self and Other
We may experience ourselves as separate fi-om an outside world, but we are linked to our
environment by countless threads of cause and effect, emotion and thought. The 7-8 pair can
show us these connections. Card 7 represents you, Card 8, the other. Card 8 can stand for
another person (example l ), group (example 2), or the environment in general (example 3).
Examples-Position 7 and Position 8
I. You and Another Person
Cynthia didn't share what was on her mind until she saw Justice as Card 7. When I told
her this card can mean having to accept the results of a past action, she volunteered that she
was worried about being pregnant. The timing was just not right for her and her boyfriend;
however, she was comforted to see the Lovers as Card 8. This card suggests that another
person-probably her boyfriend-will be loving and supportive. The Lovers card also rein­
forces the sexual context.
52 Learning the Tarot
### 2. You and a Group

I was concerned about a drug I was being urged to take as part of a treatment program. I
drew the Five of Pentacles as Card 7 and the Hierophant as Card 8. I interpreted the
Hierophant as the orthodox medical establishment with its strong belief in the value of drug
therapy. The Rve of Pentacles shows how isolated I felt refUsing to go along with the program,
even though I was running the risk of illness.
### 3. You and the Environment

You are an enthusiastic saver. You enjoy the security of having a ready supply of cash in
the bank, but now a business venture has come your way. You wonder if you should take it.
You draw the Four of Pentacles as Card 7 and the Ace of Pentacles as Card 8. The Four shows
your tendency to save, but the Ace suggests that this venture may be offering you the chance
fOr greater financial rewards.
Position 5 and Position 1 0-Possible Futures
Three cards refer to the fUture: Card 6 (near fUture), Card 10 Ganger-range fUture), and Card
5 (possible alternate fUture). The 5-10 pair lets you compare what you think will happen
(Five) with what is actually projected to happen (Ten), if all energies continue as they are.
There are several possibilities :
Card 5 Card 10
(example 1) positive vision does not match negative outcome
(example 2) negative vision does not match positive outcome
(example 3) vision matches/reinfOrces projected outcome
When Card 5 reinfOrces Card 10, your beliefS are flowing with the thrust of events. If you
react positively to both cards, you can stay the course. If you react negatively. you can change
your beliefS to change the outcome .
Examples-Position 5 and Position 1 0
I. Vision (Positive)-Projected Outcome (Negative)
You're working on your Ph.D. and have set the date fOr your oral presentation . You do a
reading to see how well you are progressing and draw the Six of Wands as Card 5 and the
Position Pairs m the Celtic Cross Spread 53
Nine of Swords as Card I 0. This pair is giving you a loud wake-up call. You are picturing a
triumphant victory parade for yourself, but the projected outcome is the opposite-an anx­
ious experience. You need to take steps to make sure your projected future is more in keep­
ing with your goal.
### 2. Vision (Negative)-Projected Outcome (Positive)

You've always wanted to quit your job and pursue music, but the reality of the move
scares you. You wonder if you will ever have the nerve to try. You draw the Devil as Card 5
and the Three of Wands as Card I 0. The Devil shows that even though you feel stuck, you're
afraid to change. You think success is out of reach, and you're worried that you could lose
everything. The Three of Wands suggests that if you take the leap and leave the secure be­
hind, you may discover a whole new world for yourself
### 3. Vision Matches Projected Outcome

You've noticed that Allison, your teenage daughter, has been aloof and secretive lately.
You're wondering what's going on. You draw the Seven of Swords as Card 5 and the Tower
as Card I 0. The Seven shows how worried you are that your daughter is hiding something.
The Tower suggests that if you don't talk to Allison soon, the result could be a crisis or an­
gry scene that will be upsetting for everyone.
54 Learning the Tarot
Position 9-Wild Card
Traditionally, Card 9 represents your "hopes and fears," but it can also be a guidance card.
When you read the cards fOr yourself, you need a card to help you put everything together.
Card 9 can explain and integrate the other cards by showing:
(example 1)
(example 2)
(example 3) approach to take or way to proceed
key person, problem, or obstacle
element of surprise
Examples-Position 9
I. Your Guidance-the Way to Proceed
Two Knights once appeared in a reading fOr Ralph: Cups as Card 1 and Pentacles as Card
10. I sensed that this man was torn by the need to express two different sides of himself­
the artistic and the practical. The key to this interpretation was the Two of Cups as Card 9.
It told me that Ralph needed to unite his two impulses-combine the inner aspects that were
at odds.
Position Pairs in the Celtic Cross Spread 55
### 2. Problem or Obstacle

I've learned over the years that the Five of Swords is a special sym­
bol for me. This card almost always implies that I'm putting my own
interests before those of others when it is not wise to do so. This card
appeared as Card 9 in a reading about the contract fur this book. I knew
right away I would have to watch my attitude if I wanted the arrange­
ments to go smoothly. Over time you may find that certain tarot cards
become personal symbols for you as well.
### 3. Surprises

One day I received a letter from my son's
teacher. She wanted to talk to me about an inci-
dent in class. I drew the Five of Wands as Card 9.
I assumed this card meant my son was working at cross-purposes with
his environment. Later, I learned the facts: my son had poked another
child repeatedly with a pencil. This came as a surprise as he had never
done such a thing befure. In fact, the image on the Five of Pentacles was
showing me the problem-a young person holding a long piece of
wood Oike a pencil~) and using it repeatedly as a weapon (five figures).
The cards in a reading do not always form pairs. Looking for them is
just one technique among many. The pairings in this lesson are only
suggestions. Let your intuition guide you to combinations that are meaningful to you.
## Lesson 17

Reversed Cards
When you shuffle the tarot cards, they often end up facing in different directions. So far, I've
suggested that you ignore this effect and simply turn the upside-down cards around. Now
you are ready to learn more about reversed cards and what they have to offer.
All life is energy-currents of force that mix and blend to form the patterns of our lives.
Each tarot card symbolizes a particular energy, and a tarot reading shows the collective ener­
gies that make up a situation. When you do a reading, your actions and intentions align the
energies of the moment with the cards to form a picture. The cards capture the energy cur­
rents in and around you as you shuffle and cut.
At any given moment, these energies will be at different levels. Some will be strong and
powerful. others less so. Some will be entering your life, others, moving away. How you use
these energies depends on all the factors that bear on your situation.
When a card is upright, its energy is fi-ee to manifest. Its qualities are available and active.
When a card is reversed, its energy is not fully developed. It may be in
its early stages, or losing power. It may be incomplet e or unavailable.
The qualities of the card are present, at least in potential, but they can't
express completely.
The Sun's energy is just what you would imagine-expansive and
enlightening. An upright Sun shows the energy of vitality is openly
available. You feel confident and successful. Now is your chance to shine.
A reversed Sun shows this same energy is present, but at a lower level.
The vitality is reduced or limited in some way. You may feel lowered
pep or enthusiasm. You may have a desire for greatness that is being
frustrated. You want success, but something is holding you back.
The Empress reversed once appeared in a reading for a man who
wanted to know if he and his wife might have a child. I guessed they
had been trying to have a baby for some time. This card showed that
the energy of mothering and birth was present, but held down in some
way. This pregnancy was blocked. I told this man that once the block
was removed, the chances for a child were good. Something must have
happened to fi-ee up that energy because now they have a beautiful
baby girJl
It is tempting to view a reversed card as undesirable. This man
wanted a baby, so he was disheartened by the reversed Empress. Some­
one else might have viewed the same card differentl y. Reversed cards are
not negative in and of themselves. Everything depends on what you
hope to achieve.
Reversed Cards
The Three of Swords represents the energy of heartbreak and be­
trayal. If this card is upright, hurtful feelings are a feature of the situa­
tion. Reversed, they are also present, but reduced. Perhaps the intensity
of a painful episode is fuding, or you are feeling lonely, but just a little.
A reversed Three of Swords is more agreeable than an upright one, but
it is still a cautionary sign. The fuct that an unpleasant card appears at
all means that its energy is present in some way.
Sometimes a card is reversed even though you are experiencing a
high level of its energy. In this case, the reversal hints that you can im­
prove your situation by making a conscious effort to lower the energy.
You have drawn the Seven of Wands reversed
in a reading about being pressured to do some­57
thing you don't want to do. This card represents defiance. Since you are
being pushed against your will, you are probably feeling defiant in this
situation. The Seven of Wands reversed suggests that you might try to
subdue your strong emotions. Lessen your feelings of defiance and find
a different way to deal with the problem. (Of course, it's possible that
the energy is low because your defiance is being squelched~ Only you
can tell which interpretation is best.)
The meaning of a reversed card sometimes comes from a twist in the
usual interpretation . In this sense, the Emperor reversed could show a
Jm. powerful authority figure toppled from his throne. The Ten of Wands
reversed might remind you to get out !Tom under burdensome respon­
sibilities. It's surprising how often such meanings apply, but you can't force them. They tend
to occur as needed.
You can form pairs that contain reversed cards. Here is an example:
The Sun and Moon are opposites in the area of clarity-the Sun is enlightenment, the
Moon, confusion . In a reading, a reversed Sun/upright Moon could show that certainty is low
(Sun), and uncertainty is high (Moon), or you are bewildered now (Moon), but greater clar­
ity is possible (Sun).
58 Learning the Tarot
It's helpful to look at the proportion of reversed and upright cards in a reading. When
many cards are upright, your energies are expressing freely and powerfully. The overall situ­
ation is well developed, and your purpose is clear. When many cards are reversed, your en­
ergies are low, and the situation is not clearly defined. You may lack direction or feel blocked,
discouraged, and restricted. You could be in a topsy-turvy state where change is likely. Since
energies are not well developed, they are free to go in new directions.
I encourage you to try using reversed cards. When you feel ready, state out loud your
intention to use them. You might say, "I have decided to interpret reversed cards in my tarot
readings." In this way, you acknowledge your dedsion with conviction. After a time, if you decide
you like using reversed cards, add them to your practice permanently. If not, just let them go.
It's better to decide one way or the other, as switching back and fOrth can be confusing .
Life is a constant energy flow-a marvelous dance guided by Spirit. When we understand
that flow and move with it creatively, all things are possible. We can direct energy consciously
or just let it take us where it will. In either case, reversed cards add an extra dimension to a
reading that will help you appreciate the play of energy in your own life.
## Lesson 18

Creating the Story
In this lesson, you will learn how to pull together the elements of a reading-to create a tarot
story. This is not an easy process to describe because storytelling is an art. Even though you
can be shown a few techniques, in the end, you must develop your own style as a tarot art­
ist. This is the challenge (and fun!) of card interpretation.
First, I want you to set aside everything you've learned so far1 That's right, just disregard
all those fancy principles. In the last seventeen lessons, you've been exposed to pages of
information about the cards, and I've only touched on the possibilities1 Other tarot books
contain system after system for relating the cards to each other. This is fascinating stuff.
but what is its real purpose' It is to find a way to release your inner knowing through the
cards.
The techniques you've learned so far have been based on the idea that you must figure out
what the cards are saying, but this is not really the case. If you think of a tarot reading as an
object to be dissected, you will have trouble grasping its full meaning. A tarot story doesn't
come from without; it arises from within. Your stories come from a part of you that is seek­
ing expression and conscious realization.
Of course, I don't really want you to discard your tarot principles. They are valuable, but
not because they hold the key to readings in themselves. They simply help you recognize
what you already know. They draw you in so you can set up the circumstances to release
your story.
The secret of creating a tarot story is getting from intellectual understanding to knowing,
from a piecemeal grasp to a unified vision. To do this, you need to recognize and honor your
feelings. Feelings in this sense are not moods or emotions. They are the language of your In­
ner Guide. They are the outward expression of a knowing that is deeper than thought. The
main feature of knowing is a sense of rightness. You know your insights are correct when you
feel complete and satisfied with them.
The best way I've found to release inner knowing is through stream-of-consciousness talk­
ing-saying your thoughts out loud as they occur, uncensored and uncontrolled. You make
no attempt to organize or clean up your speech. You simply let the words come out.
This technique is eRective because it bypasses the critical ego. It allows the wisdom of your
Inner Guide to come forth spontaneously. You feel as if something within has been set free.
Your first attempts will probably be awkward, but your stories will improve with practice.
You will develop an ability to guide the flow of words without imposing your will on them.
Sometimes insights will surface that completely surprise you1
It's not necessary to rush or talk continually. You can pause whenever you want, but avoid
thinking when this happens. Simply wait patiently until you feel the impulse to continue.
Sometimes repeating the name of a card a few times can help. Queen of Cups ... Queen of
60 Learning the Tarot
Cups ... Queen of Cups. After each repetition, wait to see if anything comes to mind in the
furm of a thought or image.
Sometimes your story will just flow. You will have no trouble fitting everything together.
Other times there will be gaps and empty places. Certain cards will stay stubbornly obscure.
The moment may not be right for you to fully grasp these cards, or all
the pieces of the story may not yet be in place.
Don't be concerned if you can't always create a beautiful narrative.
Sometimes knowing comes in fragments. Stay with a reading only as
long as the effurt seems worthwhile. A partial understanding may be all
you need.
I once drew the Ace of Pentacles reversed in Position 9. I knew right
away that this card was telling me not to fucus on money or material
concerns. This realization hit me as soon as I saw the card. Everything
I needed to know was in that one Ace, so interpreting the other cards
was not all that necessary.
A good tarot spread makes weaving the pattern of the cards easy. By
fOllowing the spread's built-in structure, your story unfolds naturally.
Each spread has its own character based on its history, furm, and purpose. I discuss some fea­
tures of the Celtic Cross spread in that section.
Your tarot story ends when your talking begins to wind down and come to a stop. A few
stray thoughts may still occur to you, but the main theme will have been established. You
will know the essential message of the reading.
Stream-of-consciousness talking is an effective style fur me, but you may not like it. You
may prefer to sit quietly aqd absorb the meaning of the cards. Some people like to write out
their reactions or create charts that cross-correlate the cards in a systematic way. Each of us
is different, and our approaches to the tarot will be different too.
I'd like to leave you with one final thought about tarot stories. Trust yourself and your
intuition completely. Banish right now any concerns you have about reading the cards cor­
rectly. You really can't make mistakes. Your tarot realizations are always the right ones fur you
at a given time and place. They are meaningful because they are yours. Know you are truly
connected to all that is. You can access an understanding that is fur greater than your every­
day awareness. Trust that this is so.
lESSON 19
Some Final Thoughts
My family loves horse racing. They pour over the statistics on the horses to see if they can
pick the winner for each race. Sometimes I go with them and bring a friend who has never
been to the races before. Invariably, I wind up sitting between my family, picking winners
from experience, and my friend, picking winners from beginner's luck. I'm in the middle with
no winners and just enough knowledge to be ineffective'
If you feel the same way right now about the tarot, don't be discouraged. At this point,
you have a firm fOundation of knowledge about the cards that will sustain you in the days
ahead. If you continue to practice, you'll find the techniques become more and more invis­
ible as your intuition takes over. Eventually you will reach a point where you can rely on your
tarot abilities consistently. You won't have to continue working with the cards as intensely,
unless you want to. These days I go to the cards only when I have a puzzling problem or
situation that I know they can help me with. The tarot is a tool I can count on.
I'm sure you've found already that you do not feel neutral about
your readings. No matter what the situation, as you lay out the cards,
you hope fur ones that will be positive and encouraging. This is only
natural. In my experience, people want to know right away if their situ­
ation looks good. They respond cheerfully to the pleasant cards, but
recoil in disappointment if a nasty one appears. Indeed, it is difficult to
look at the Tower and accept it calmly. We don't want something scary
to happen; we want the good'
In fact, the good and the bad are so mixed in life that these terms
finally become meaningless. If you were to lose a leg in an accident, but
then develop great inner strength during recovery, could you really say
the accident was completely bad' If you were to be fired from your job,
but then find a better one on the rebound, where is the positive and
negative in this situation?
The cards in the tarot are not good or bad in themselves . They only describe certain en­
ergies or influences . It is up to you to use this information to make conscious choices about
your life. Although the Tower can show a shattering breakup or downfall of some kind, you
do not have to view this negatively. Sometimes an explosion of feeling or dramatic shakeup
provides welcome relief. clearing the air and freeing up new energy.
It is your concentrated clarity about a situation that gives you the power to mold events
along the lines of your choosing. This clarity comes from the wisdom of your Inner Guide
paired with the fearless confidence you have in yourself A reading does not deliver news to
you as a passive victim, but as a powerful agent who can use that infOrmation creatively. It
62 Learning the Tarot
gives you a picture of the energy patterns in and around you so that you can work with them
as you see fit.
Always remember that the outcome pictured in a reading is the one projected for now
from all the influences of the present moment. If you can identifY those furces, you can alter
or encourage them as you wish. The future is never fixed. The outcome of your story is not
a certainty, but a possibility. You can always embrace or change a direction provided you have
the desire and courage to take the necessary steps. At the deepest level. you know what your
situation is all about. Your tarot story simply lets you recognize what you know so you can
act consciously .
Perhaps you are concerned that you aren't objective enough when reading the cards. You
suspect that you only see in a reading what you want to see, and not the truth. In fact, that is
exactly the point1 The tarot helps you find out what it is you do believe, so you can acknowl­
edge it. Your unconscious becomes conscious. You can't interpret falsely, but you can fail to
perceive all that is there. The tarot is a mirror that reflects your own consciousness back to
you. As you learn, that mirror becomes clearer, and you perceive at ever deeper levels.
A tarot practice is based on the understanding that wisdom from some Source will come
to you through the cards. At first, you may have to accept this on faith, but after awhile you
will receive the "proof" you need in the results you experience in your life. If you can ap­
proach the cards with trust, your tarot practice will take off Good luck~

## Exercises

Introduction to the Exercises
These exercises give you a chance to practice the concepts presented in the lessons. Do the
ones that appeal to you, and take them at your own pace. You don't have to do any exercises
befOre continuing with the lessons. They are completely optional. The later exercises do build
on earlier lessons, so it's best not to skip ahead.
For some exercises, I give examples of possible responses. These are fOund in the "sugges­
tions" section. My suggestions are not answers. They are simply examples of the kinds of in­
sights you can get from the cards. In the tarot, whatever your intuition tells you is valid.
Everyone sees the world through a different lens. Your goal is to learn how your own par­
ticular lens works.
ExERCISES FOR LESSON 1
Introduction to the Tarot
Exercise 1.1-What Do I Believe?
Think over the ideas presented in lesson I. Write down briefly what you do and do not be­
lieve at this time about the tarot. Assign a percentage to your beliefS where:
0% = "I am totally skeptical about using the tarot fur anything but fun."
I 00% = "I am absolutely convinced that the tarot can give me specific, personal guidance."
Exercise 1.2-(jetting to Know a Card
Shuffle your tarot deck and choose a card. Look at the image fur a while. Ask yourself these
questions:
I. What story do I see in the picture?
### 2. What emotions do I feeP

### 3. How do the details in the picture reinfOrce those ideas7

### 4. What is the overall mood?

### 5. What do I think this card might mean?

When you are through, go to the infOrmation page fur the card and read through the actions.
Compare these to your impressions . Do not be concerned if your ideas do not match mine.
Your intuition is working and already giving you some unique insights~ You can repeat this
exercise with as many cards as you like.
Exercise 1.3-How Do I Contribute to "Random" Events?
Choose an event from your past in which you felt victimized by fOrces over which you had
little control. List ways you actually did contribute to this event. My camera and typewriter
were once stolen from my apartment. I didn't give the robber a map, but I
I. did rent an accessible I st floor apartment;
2. did leave my items lying around;
3. did invest my money in expensive items;
4. did not invest in a burglar alarm system;
5. did not investigate when I thought I heard someone.
This list includes choices I made and those I failed to make. Some relate to the robbery and
some to bigger issues. None of these choices is wrong, but they all have effects that contrib­
ute to "random" events.
Exercise 1.4-Answers from Nowhere
Try this exercise when you're in a library or bookstore. Think about a problem that concerns
you. Close your eyes, and suggest silently to your Inner Guide that you are seeking advice.
Ask it to help you learn what you need to know.
Now, wander freely through the aisles. Avoid noticing where you are; just trust your in­
ner promptings to guide you. When you feel ready, pick up a book and open to a page. Read
Exercises 67
the entire page, and try to relate what is there to your problem. You may be surprised to find
just what you needed. If the information doesn't seem related, pretend the message is in a
code that you must decipher. Look for a subtle meaning. Meaning is everywhere-literally
at your fingertips-but you must seek it out.
Exercise 1.5-You Can Qet What You Need
Before going to bed, take a five dollar bill in your hand, close your eyes and ask that you be
shown during the day how to use this five dollars to benefit yourself or the world. (A five
dollar bill is a practical symbol of the means by which we carry out our purposes in life.)
Place the money under your pillow. In the morning, repeat your request, and then take
the bill with you. During the day. keep alert for a sign of how to use it. Stay focused so you
don't miss the slightest clue. You will recognize the moment when you feel a little jolt. If
nothing strikes you the first day. continue for one week. Give the world a good chance to
respond. Try not to forget your morning and evening requests. The strength of your intent
and commitment is important.
Later, think about the implications of this approach to the world. Life will bring you what
you seek if you ask and trust, but the answer may not be in the form you expect~
ExERCISES FOR LESSON 2
The Major Arcana
Exercise 2.1-Studying the Major Arcana cards
Spend a few minutes looking at section 4 so you understand how to use it. Become familiar
with keywords and actions as I use these terms in the lessons: Don't worry about memoriz­
ing anything. The goal is simply to get comfortable with the information.
Now, choose any major arcana card from the deck and go to its information page. Notice
how the keywords reinforce each other to create a certain kind of energy or focus. Note also
how the actions flesh out the keywords. Read the description, but just glance at the "oppos­
ing" and "reinforcing" sections for now. You will learn more about these in lesson IS. You can
repeat this exercise for as many major arcana cards as you like.
Exercise 2.2-Fool's Journey
The Fool's Journey is an interpretation of how the major arcana symbolizes the stages of

a unit. Be open to the possibility that you may develop your own ideas about these cards and
what they mean.
## Exercises For Lesson 3

The Minor Arcana
Exercise 3.1-What are the Suit Qualities?
Review the lists of suit qualities in appendix B. They describe some positive and negative
expressions of each suit. Don't try to memorize these lists. They are simply designed to give
you a first feel fur the energy of each suit. When you're ready, go through the word pairs
below. For each pair, give the suit and expression ( + or -) that seems most appropriate to you.
For "dependable and careful" you might say "Pentacles-positive." See page 93 fur my sugges­
tions. When your choices are different from mine, try to figure out why In this way, you begin
refining your own understanding of each suit. You can also have a friend quiz you using new
two-word combinations from the lists.

Many aspects of daily life reflect the energy of one suit in particular. For each activity below,
state the suit and expression you believe fits that activity best, and name a few qualities that
support your choice. Going skydiving might be a "Wands-positive" activity because you
must be "daring, energetic, and confident" (or a Wands-negative activity because it is "fOol­
hardy and reckless"D. See page 93 fur my suggestions.

The Spread
Exercise 4.1-Celtic Cross Spread
Spend a few minutes looking at the section about the Celtic Cross so you understand how
it is set up. Don't worry about memorizing anything. The goal is simply to get comfOrtable
with the infOrmation.
Now, lay out ten cards of your choice using this spread. Read the page fOr each position
one by one. Think about the meaning each card takes on because it falls in a certain position.
You will learn more about this later, but just speculate fOr now.
Exercise 4.2-Designing a Spread
You can design spreads yourself to suit your needs. Create fOr yourself now a three-card tarot
spread. Follow these steps:
I. Draw a picture of the physical layout-where the cards should go.
### 2. Number the positions to show order of placement .

### 3. Write a short phrase or two describing the meaning of each position.

Here's a basic three-card spread that covers events in time:

ExERCISES FOR LESSON 5
The Daily Reading
Exercise 5.1-Learning the Cards One By One
You can become more familiar with each tarot card by concentrating on a different one each
day. This exercise takes a minimum of seventy-eight days, so it is quite a commitment, but if
you stick with it, you will know the tarot deck very well when you are done.
Decide now how you will choose your daily card during this learning phase. You can be
systematic (first the Wands, then the Cups, etc.) or spontaneous. You can pick a card that
catches your eye, or one that seems fitting fur the day's events. A single day on each card is
enough, but you can take longer, if you wish.
When you have selected a card, read its infOrmation page at least once. Write down the
keywords and try to memorize them. They will help you remember the meanings of a card
quickly. Study the details of the card's picture as well. You may want to make a copy of the
card's infOrmation page to refer to during the day. I don't recommend carrying your card
around as it could get lost or damaged . Start a journal, if you wish.
Exercise 5.2-Establishing a Daily Reading Practice
When you have studied all the tarot cards at least once, begin drawing your cards without
conscious deliberation . Follow the steps listed in lesson 5. Continue to make entries in your
journal, if you have one. After a month or two, calculate the distribution of suits and major
arcana cards. Do you notice a pattern that reflects your situation? Do certain card(s) show
up frequently? Ask yourself why this might be so.
## Exercises For Lesson 6

The Environment
Exercise 6.1-Creating a Place To Do Your Readings
Spend some time thinking about where you will do your tarot readings. Consider some of
the suggestions in lesson 6 or use your own ideas. Don't feel you have to create a showcase
location . .Just see what you can do to create a setting that is pleasing and comfOrtable.
Exercise 6.2-Quest for a Symbol
In this exercise, you will be announcing your intent to find or create an object that will be a
personal symbol of your tarot practice. You can buy, find or make this object yourself Once
you have it, place it in your tarot spot as an inspiration fur your work.
Read over the description of the Fool. This card often stands fur the feeling of joy and free­
dom that comes from beginning a new adventure. It is in this spirit that you will seek your
Exercises 73
object. This quest symbolizes the quest for greater understanding you are undertaking by
learning the tarot.
Hold the Fool in your hands, and close your eyes. Announce your desire to find or create
a tarot symbol. Commit to working until you have it. The value you place on this quest will
reinforce the value of your larger quest. Once you have affirmed your intent, let it go. You
will find what you are looking for.
This exercise will strengthen your faith and commitment and leave you with a tangible
symbol of your purpose. It will also help you learn that hidden within seemingly foolish acts
is the experience of life as an adventure.

Writing a Question
Exercise 7.1-Writing a Tarot Question
You are going to write a question for your first tarot reading. Think about your life for a
moment, and choose an area in which you are having some difficulty. (We all have one of
these!) Avoid general concerns such as finding a life partner. Pick a specific everyday problem
that is troubling you right now in your home or workplace. Choose something that involves
you directly and that you care about personally. Follow the recommendations in lesson 7 for
writing an effective question. Take notes as you go. We will be using these notes and your
question in the next lesson.
Exercise 7.2-Practicing Question Writing
Life will offer you many opportunities to practice writing questions . Any time you face a
problem, take a moment to create a question about it. Work on it while you're doing rou­
tine activities, such as riding in a car or doing housework.
Writing practice questions helps you learn to analyze a personal problem quickly and
recognize what you want in various situations. Also, if you decide to do a reading about the
problem, you will have your question ready.
## Exercise For Lesson 8

The Question Reading
Exercise 8.1-Doing a Question Reading
You are going to do a Celtic Cross Question Reading from start to finish. Follow the proce­
dure outlined in lesson 8. (Also refer to the step-by-step outline in appendix E) You will need
74 Learning the Tarot
a question to be answered. You can use the question you wrote in Exercise 7.1 or write a new
one. Interpret the cards as best you can using your intuition and the sections about individual
cards and the Celtic Cross.
You may feel a little at sea this first time-not sure whether or not you're doing everything
right. Remember there is no one correct interpretation . What you see in the cards is right
fOr you by definition, and, no matter what, you will come away with something of value. In
fUture lessons, you will learn some principles of interpretation that will help you feel more
confident. At that point, we'll revisit this reading to see what else you can learn from it.
EXERCISES FOR lESSON 9
The Other Reading
Exercise 9.1-Doing a Reading About a News Event
Go through today's newspaper and choose a topic that interests you. Look fOr one that is in­
triguing and somewhat controversial. A short-term media event is a good choice because you
will get feedback on the situation quickly. Read over the facts that are available, and write a
question that covers one aspect of the situation. Do an Other Reading fOllowing the proce­
dure described in lesson 9. Write down your interpretation and what you predict the out­
come will be.
Later, when the situation has resolved somewhat , go over your reading and relate it to
what happened . If your interpretation doesn't seem to fit, look at the cards again to see if you
can find something new in them.
Exercise 9.2-Am I Involved?
Think of a problem that is bothering a close friend, relative, or colleague. Choose a person
whose concerns are important to you. Write a question about the problem as if you were
doing an Other Reading. Deliberately keep yourself out of the question. When you are done,
ask yourself these three questions :
### 1. Do I feel strong emotions when I think about this person in this situation7

### 2. Do I have a vested interest in this situation?

### 3. Do I desire a particular outcome in this situation?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, rewrite your original question so that it is cen­
tered on you. The goal of this exercise is to help you learn to tell when a problem involves
you directly and when it doesn't.
Exercise 9 .3-lmaginary Situations
You can create a troubling set of circumstances fOr an imaginary person, and then do an
Other Reading about it. You can also borrow a situation from the advice columns in the news­
papers. These are great resources fOr problems of all kinds.

The Open Reading
Exercise 10.1-Doing an Open Reading
During the next few weeks, look fur an opportunity to try an Open Reading. I recommend
a fairly quiet day when you feel at peace with your life and attuned to the moment. it should
be a day when you have the time and inclination to step back a little and look at the larger
patterns that are influencing you at this time. If a birthday. anniversary. or other special occa­
sion happens to full during this period, use it as the basis fur your reading. Follow the proce­
dure described in lesson I 0.
ExERCISES FOR LESSON 11
Interpreting a Single Card
Exercise 11.1-Your Personal Reactions to a Card
Choose any card from the tarot deck. Look at it carefully and then write down your response.
It doesn't matter if you are already familiar with this card and know its meanings . Consider
whatever comes to mind to be your personal reaction. Some elements to think about are:
What feeling do I sense in the card scene?
What feeling do I sense in myself when I see this card?1
Am I attracted, repelled, or neutral about this card?
What aspect of my life comes to mind when I see this card?
Does this card remind me of anyone?
What details seem important in this card, and why7
You may not feel any reaction to the card, or perhaps just a mild one. Try to notice any quick
thought, feeling, or image that comes to mind, no matter how slight.
Exercise 11.2-Combining Sources of Meaning
In this exercise, you will practice blending card and position meanings . Choose a card from
the tarot deck, and read over its keywords and actions. Try to get a feel fur the card's essen­
tial meaning.
Imagine that your card has appeared in Position l of a Celtic Cross reading. How does
being here refine the meaning of this card? How do the card and position meanings work
together to create a composite?
I. These two feelings may be the same or different.
76 Learning the Tarot
Write one sentence that sums up your interpretation. Don't try to figure out the right
answer because there isn't one. Select a possibility that appeals to you and makes sense. Your
sentence doesn't have to relate to your own life in any way as this exercise is simply fur prac­
tice. For example, the Emperor stands fur:
fathering authority
structure regulation
Some choices fur this card in Position 1 might be:
l. Right now, the heart of the matter (Position l) is that there is too much STRUCTURE
(Emperor) in my life.
2. My present environment (Position 1) is very REGULATED and CONTROLLED (Emperor).
3. Right now the issue of becoming a FATHER (Emperor) is the primary factor in my life
(Position 1 ).
These sentences are all different, but each one blends the meanings of the Emperor and Po­
sition l. In an actual reading, the most appropriate interpretation fur you would become clear
as you considered other fuctors.
Next, write a sentence fur each of the other nine positions using the same card. If you want
extra practice, write more than one sentence fur each position, or choose a different card and
repeat the exercise.
Exercise 11.3-lnterpreting Single Cards in Celtic Cross Readings
Use your ongoing Celtic Cross readings as an opportunity to practice combining the fuur
sources of meaning:
l. personal reaction
2. card meaning
3. position meaning
4. question or situation
Be systematic at first about considering each of these areas so they become second nature to
you. Try writing a sentence fur each card as described in Exercise 11.2. Of course, you will
not have to write these sentences fOrever. Later you can be more relaxed and simply respond
without having to think about where your reaction comes from.

Exercises 77
This exercise is easier if you have something to look at. Take two decks of regular playing
cards with different colored backs. One deck will be the major arcana, and one, the minor.
Of you don't have playing cards, use squares of colored paper.) Create the layout you are
working on by placing the appropriately colored cards face down in their assigned positions.
In layout one, if blue cards are minor and red cards major, all the cards would be blue except
for a red card in Position l 0.

Exercise 12.2-Comparing the Arcanas Separately
Remove all the major arcana cards from the deck and place them in a pile. Choose a minor arcana
card for each one that has a similar meaning. You can choose on your own, or you can use my
selections (see page 94.) Put the minor arcana cards you have chosen in a separate pile.
Shuffle and cut the cards in the major arcana pile, and lay out ten in the Celtic Cross. Find
the matching minor arcana cards, and form a second Celtic Cross next to the first. Compare
your impressions of these two layouts. Ask yourself these questions:
l. What is the overall feeling conveyed by each layout'
### 2. Is this feeling the same or different'

### 3. Does one reading seem easier to understand?

### 4. Does one reading seem more accessible?

### 5. Does one reading seem more compelling'

You can repeat this exercise with different sets of cards, if you wish.
Exercise 12.3-Readings Using Only Major Arcana Cards
In the next week or so, try doing a reading using just the major arcana cards. I recommend
doing an Open Reading as major arcana cards ofler the expansive guidance that suits this type
of reading.

You may flnd this technique works well for you. Some people prefer using only the major
arcana at all times. Major arcana readings clarify the main, decisive themes at work in your life.

Aces
Exercise 13.1-The Energy of the Aces
The Aces have a clear energy that is undiluted by situational factors. This exercise will help
you experience that energy. Remove the four Aces from your deck and place them in a row
in front of you as follows:
Write the fuur keywords fur each Ace on a piece of paper and place it below the card. Now,
concentrate on the Aces one at a time until you feel you know them well. Try to get to a
point where you can see an Ace and immediately feel its powerful presence. (The flrst key­
word fur each Ace includes the word force!) Look at the details on the cards, especially the
suit icons. Notice how each icon captures the qualities of its Ace.
Exercise 13.2-Visualizing with the Aces
The Aces are excellent images for visualization practice. When you want to feel the quali­
ties of an Ace, picture its image with your inner eye. Simplify the image by visualizing just
the hand holding the suit icon. Feel yourself calling down the power of the Ace as a lightning
rod calls down the energy of a storm. Some qualities you can tap are:
Ace of Wands-courage, confidence, creativity, enthusiasm
Ace of Cups-love , fOrgiveness, insight, faith
Ace of Swords-intellect, fOrtitude, honesty, clarity
Ace of Pentacles-security, prosperity, trust, competence
Exercises 79
As you learn more about the Aces, you will know which one is appropriate fOr any situation
and you will have a technique fOr accessing its energy whenever you wish.

or reinforce each other. See page 99 for my suggestions. Here are two possibilities fur the
Empress and the Three of Cups:
Empress-a lone woman fucused on herself
Three of Cups-a group of women fucused on each other.
Empress-a seated woman who is rather serious and inactive.
Three of Cups-dancing women who are lively and lighthearted .
For extra practice, deal out two cards at random on your own.

Reversed Cards
Exercise 17.1-The Energy of a Card
Shuffle the cards so there is a mixture of upright and reversed cards (see appendix E). Hold
the deck fuce down in one hand. Turn over the first card, and lay it in front of you. Answer
these questions :
I. What is the energy of this card fOr me at this moment? Listen fOr a word or phrase
to pop into your mind. Don't try to remember an official meaning; simply wait fOr an
idea to enter awareness. Let the energy of the card present itself to you on its own.
2. What is the level of this energy as shown by the card's orientation? An upright card
represents high energy; a reversed card represents low energy.
3. How am I experiencing this energy at this leveP Again, let an idea come to mind on
its own.
Here are two examples:
Nine of Wands-upright
I. perseverance
2. high level
### 3. I'm determined to get good grades at school.

Queen of Swords-reversed
1. sitting in judgment (based on the image)

EXERCISES FOR lESSON 18
Creating the Story
Exercise 18.1-Stream-of-Consciousness Talking
You can practice stream-of-consciousness talking anytime you feel comfortable speaking your
thoughts out loud. (For most of us, this means being alone1) Say every thought as it occurs
to you. The idea is to "hear" a thought inwardly and then vocalize it. As you finish speaking
one thought, listen fur the next one.
In the next few weeks, try this exercise whenever you can. Work toward being able to speak
naturally with no sense of urgency. Try to get to the point where thoughts about the process don't
intrude too much. This is not an easy state to achieve, but it is well worth the effOrt.
Exercise 18.2-Tarot Improvisation
In theater improvisation, members of the audience call out the names of a few objects, and
the actors must assemble a skit based on those elements. In this exercise, the cards are the
elements, and you are the actor who must bring them together on the fly.
Shuffle and cut the cards in the usual way. Hold the deck face down in one hand. Turn over
the first three cards, and lay them in a row. Now, create a story around the cards. Don't
struggle to come up with a clever scenario. Just allow any tale to unfold. In The Castle of
Crossed Destinies by !tala Calvina, 1 the characters tell their tales to each other using only tarot
card images.
When you are through, set the first three cards aside and deal out three more fur a new
story. Or, if you like, keep the first three cards and lay out a fOurth. Incorporate this card into
the original tale. Continue developing the story by laying out new cards one at a time. The
spirit of this exercise is spontaneous play. Stop if you feel any pressure or strain.
Exercise 18.3-The Structure of the Celtic Cross
Lay out any ten cards in the usual Celtic Cross fOrmat. Read the interpretation procedure fur
this spread in the Celtic Cross section. Create a story fOllowing these steps. How well does
this approach work fur you7 What changes would you make7
I. ltalo Calvino, The Castle of Crossed Destinies (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1969).
90 Learning the Tarot
Next, lay out a new set of ten cards. Experiment with different story structures. Try start­
ing with the outcome card (I 0) and working backward or building a story around a striking
card pair. Explore new approaches with different sets of cards. For your readings, you will
probably settle on a favorite approach, but it helps to know of other possibilities that you can
draw on as needed.
ExERCISE FOR LESSON 19
Some Final Thoughts
Exercise 19.1-Return of What Do I Believe?
In exercise l.l, I asked you to write down briefly what you do and do not believe about the
tarot and to assign a percentage to those beliefS where:
0% = "! am totally skeptical about using the tarot fur anything but fun.n
I 00% = "! am absolutely convinced that the tarot can give me specific, personal guidance."
Repeat this exercise now before rereading what you wrote earlier. When you're done, go back
and look at your original answer. Pause to reflect on all that you have learned and experienced
since you began this course of study.

Exercise 12.1-Arcana Cards in the Celtic Cross
1. All cards are minor except the outcome (Position 1 0>. This situation is a temporary
personal drama, but its impact will be powerful and significant in some way.
2. The only major arcana card is in the Past (Position 4). The circumstances of the mo­
ment are the result of some major event from the past, or what was once of major sig­
nificance is now fuding.
3. Position 8-the environment-is the only major arcana card. This situation may be part
of a larger undertaking, or the outside influence may be especially strong.
4. Since Position 3 is the only major arcana card, the hidden, underlying energy here is
strong. Things may be minor on the surface, but the furce sustaining them is powerful.
5. Two major arcana cards are at the center of the reading (Positions 1 and 2). Two pow­
erful fOrces are coming together fur better or worse. The minor fuctors circling around
are an offShoot of this core dynamic.
6. Someone thinks (Position 5) that his role (Position 7) in the situation is major, but the
actual circumstances do not bear this out.

The Fool
Description
As Card 0, the Fool lies at the beginning of the major arcana, but also
somewhat apart from the other cards. In medieval courts, the court
jester was someone who was not expected to fOllow the same rules as
others. He could observe and then poke fun. This makes the Fool un­
predictable and full of surprises. He reminds us of the unlimited poten­
tial and spontaneity inherent in every moment. There is a sense with
this card that anything goes-nothing is certain or regular. The Fool adds
the new and unfamiliar to a situation.
The Fool also represents the complete faith that life is good and wor­
thy of trust. Some might call the Fool too innocent, but his innocence 113
0
sustains him and brings him joy. In readings, the Fool can signal a new beginning or change
of direction-one that will guide you onto a path of adventure , wonder, and personal growth.
He also reminds you to keep your faith and trust your natural responses. If you are facing a
decision or moment of doubt, the Fool tells you to believe in yourself and fOllow your heart
no matter how crazy or fOolish your impulses may seem.

The Magician
Description
The Magician is the archetype of the active, masculine principle-the
ultimate achiever. He symbolizes the power to tap universal fOrces and
use them fur creative purposes. Note his stance in the picture. He acts
as a lightning rod-one arm extended up into the Divine fOr inspiration,
the other pointing toward Earth to ground this potent energy.1 His abili­
ties appear magical at times because his will helps him achieve what
seem to be miracles.
What makes the Magician so powerful? First, he is not afraid to act.
He believes in himself and is willing to put that belief on the line. He
also knows what he intends to do and why. He doesn't hesitate because ll5
he understands his situation exactly. The Magician can fOcus with single-minded determina­
tion. As long as he remembers the divine source of his power, the Magician remains the per­
fect conduit for miracles.
In a reading, the Magician implies that the primal fOrces of creativity are yours if you can
claim your power and act with awareness and concentration . This card is a signal to act and
act now, provided you understand exactly what you want and are committed to getting it.

The H;gh Priestess
Description
The High Priestess is the guardian of the unconscious . She sits in front
of the thin veil of unawareness which is all that separates us from our
inner landscape . She contains within herself the secret of these realms
and offers us the silent invitation, "Be still and know that I am God."
The High Priestess is the feminine principle that balances the mascu­
line furce of the Magician. The feminine archetype in the tarot is split
between the High Priestess and the Empress. The High Priestess is the
mysterious unknown that women often represent, especially in cultures
that fucus on the tangible and known. The Empress represents woman's
role as the crucible of life. 117
In readings, the High Priestess poses a challenge to you to go deeper-to look beyond the
obvious, surface situation to what is hidden and obscure. She also asks you to recall the vast­
ness of your potential and to remember the unlimited possibilities you hold within yourself
The High Priestess can represent a time of waiting and allowing. It is not always necessary to
act to achieve your goals. Sometimes they can be realized through a stillness that gives de­
sire a chance to flower within the fullness of time.

T1ze Empress
Description
The Empress and the High Priestess are the two halves of the female
archetype in the major arcana. The Empress represents the fertile, life­
giving Mother who reigns over the bounty of nature and the rhythms
of the Earth. From her comes all the pleasures and joys of the senses and
the abundance of new life in all its forms. The Empress encourages you
to strengthen your connections with the natural world which is the
ground of our being. Too often fulse sophistications and pleasures take
us fur from our roots. Let the Empress remind you to keep your feet
firmly planted in the Earth.
In readings the Empress can refer to any aspect of Motherhood. She 119
can be an individual mother, but as a major arcana card, she also goes beyond the specifics
of mothering to its essence-the creation of life and its sustenance through loving care and
attention.
The Empress can also represent lavish abundance of all kinds. She offers a cornucopia of
delights, especially those of the senses-food, pleasure, and beauty. She can suggest material
reward, but only with the understanding that riches go with a generous and open spirit. The
Empress asks you to embrace the principle of life and enjoy its bountiful goodness.

Justice-concerns of justice and legality
Two of Wands-having authority
Three of Wands-assuming leadership
Four of Pentacles-control, structure, order
The Emperor
Description
The figure of the Emperor says much about the essential qualities of this
card. We see a stern, commanding figure seated on a stone-slab throne.
His back is straight, and his eyes meet ours directly. He is confident of
his complete authority to rule.
The Emperor represents structure, order, and regulation-fOrces to
balance the free-flowing, lavish abundance of the Empress. He advocates
a fuur-square world where trains are on time, games are played by rules,
and commanding officers are respected. In chaotic situations, the Em­
peror can indicate the need fur organization. Loose ends should be tied
up, and wayward elements, harnessed. In situations that are already over­
controlled, he suggests the confining effect of those constraints. 121
The Emperor can represent an encounter with authority or the assumption of power and
control. As the regulator, he is often associated with legal matters, disciplinary actions, and
officialdom in all its furms. He can also stand fur an individual father or archetypal Father in
his role as guide, protector, and provider.

71ze Hierophant
Description
Except in rare cases, every human grows and develops within a culture.
We learn by living with others. The Hierophant represents such official
learning, especially in groups. A Hierophant is someone who interprets
secret knowledge . On Card 5 we see a religious figure in a fOrmal church
setting. He is wearing the elaborate vestments of his office. His task is to
bring the two initiates into the church so they can take up their ap­
pointed roles.
Besides churches, there are schools, clubs, teams, companies, and so­
cieties. The Hierophant represents all of these because his realm is struc­
tured groups with rules and assigned roles. Such environments empha­123
size belief systems-facts, rules, procedures, and ritual. Members are rewarded fur fOllowing
conventions . They develop a group identity. The Hierophant is one of three cards that fOcuses
on the group. (The Three of Cups and the Three of Pentacles are the others.)
In readings, the Hierophant often represents learning with experts or knowledgeable
teachers. This card also stands fur institutions and their values. The Hierophant is a symbol
of the need to confOrm to rules or fixed situations. His appearance in a reading can show that
you are struggling with a furce that is not innovative, free-spirited, or individual. Groups can
be enriching or stifling, depending on circumstances. Sometimes we need to fOllow a program
or embrace tradition; other times we need to trust ourselves.

7.1,e Lovers
Description
The Lovers is one card that is easy to remember. Love and sex are rivet·
ing subjects, and, as you'd expect, this card represents both. The urge fOr
union is powerful and, in its highest form, takes us beyond ourselves.
That is why an angel is blessing the bond between the man and woman
on this card.
In readings, Card 6 often refers to a relationship that is based on deep
love-the strongest fOrce of all. The relationship may not be sexual, al­
though it often is or could be. More generally, the Lovers can represent
the attractive force that draws any two entities together in a relation­
ship-whether people, ideas, events, movements, or groups. 125
Card 6 can also stand fOr tough value choices and the questioning that goes with them.
In some decks,1 the Lovers shows a man torn between two women-a virgin and a tempt­
ress. This rather old-fashioned triangle symbolizes the larger dilemmas we face when we are
tempted between right and wrong.
The Lovers can indicate a moral or ethical crossroads -a decision point where you must
choose between the high road or the low road. This card can also represent your personal
beliefS because to make such a decision you must know where you stand. Following your own
path can mean going against those who are urging you in a direction that is wrong for you.

The Chariot
Description
Picture Julius Caesar riding his chariot triumphantly into Rome. He has
defeated his enemies and conquered vast, new lands. This is the spirit of
the Chariot. Card 7 represents the victories that are possible through
willpower and self-mastery . A military image is appropriate fur the
Chariot because this card stands fur the strengths associated with com­
bat-discipline, grit, determination, and assertiveness.
The Chariot represents the positive aspects of the ego. A healthy ego
is one that is strong and self-assured. It knows what it wants and how to
get it. We can get annoyed with someone whose ego is too healthy, but
we often turn to that person to lead us through difficult moments. We
know he or she won't be wishy-washy. 127
In readings, the Chariot often appears when hard control is or could be in evidence. At
its best, hard control is not brutal, but firm and direct. It is backed by a strong will and great
confidence. The Chariot can mean self-control or control of the environment. This card also
represents victory. There are many types of wins; the Chariot's is of the win-lose type. Your
success comes from beating the competition to become number one. Such moments are
glorious in the right circumstances.

Reinforcing Cards: Some Possibilities

Strength
Description
Usually we think of strength in physical terms-big arms, powerful
legs-but there is also inner strength. Inner strength comes from an
exercise of the heart muscle. It is perseverance, courage, resolve, and
composure-qualities that help us endure when times are tough. In the
past, a person with inner strength was said to have character; he or she
could be counted on in the darkest moments. Card 8 represents this
energy of quiet determination . Strength is not a flashy card, but one that
is solid and reliable.
Card 8 also represents patience and compassion. Getting angry is
easy when events turn sour, but dealing calmly with frustration takes 129
great strength. So does accepting others and fOrgiving mistakes. We need strength to mold
situations softly. The Chariot controls through mastery and authority. Card 8 is more subtle,
even loving. Notice how the lion (itself a symbol of strength) is being guided and tamed by
the woman's gentle hands.
Card 8 will appear in a reading-When its qualities are needed. It can be a reminder not to
despair or give up. You have the inner strength to endure and triumph. If you are pushing
too hard, you need to withdraw fOr the moment and be patient. If other people or circum­
stances are driving you crazy. remember the strength that comes with love and fOrbearance.
These will see you through the hardest moments.

The Hermit
Description
The traditional hermit is a crusty, bearded character who has withdrawn
&om the company of men to live a life of seclusion and hardship. Card
9 supports this understanding . The Hermit represents the desire to turn
away &om the getting and spending of society to focus on the inner
world. He seeks answers within and knows that they will come only
with quiet and solitude.
There comes a point in life when we begin to question the obvious.
We sense there is a deeper reality and begin to search for it. This is
mainly a solitary quest because answers do not lie in the external world,
but in ourselves. The hermit on Card 9 reminds us of Oiogenes, the 131
Greek ascetic who is said to have gone out with a lantern in hand to search for an honest
man. Oiogenes is a symbol of the search for truth that the Hermit hopes to find by stripping
away all diversions .
In readings, the Hermit often suggests a need for time alone-a period of reflection when
distractions are limited. In times of action and high energy, he stands for the still center that
must be created for balance. He can also indicate that withdrawal or retreat is advised for the
moment. In addition, the Hermit can imply seeking of all kinds, especially for deeper under­
standing or the truth of a situation. "Seek, and ye shall find," we have been told, and so the
Hermit stands for guidance as well. We can receive help &om wise teachers, and, in turn, help
others as we progress.

71ze Wheel of Fortune
Description
In Greek mythology, there are three women known as the Fates. They
are responsible fur spinning the destiny of each person at his or her birth.
It is not surprising that the Fates are spinners because the wheel of fur-
; tune is an apt image fur the elusive turns of a man's fate. This is the
theme of Card I 0.
The Wheel of Fortune is one of the few cards in the major arcana that
does not have a human figure as a fOcal point. This is because its center
is above the realm of man-in the higher levels (clouds) where the des­
tinies of all are woven together in the tapestry of life. The tarot recog­
nizes that each person sets his own path in life, but is also subject to the 133
larger cycles that include him. We experience chance events that appear to be accidents al­
though they are part of the great plan.
In readings, the Wheel of Fortune can indicate a vision or realization that stikes with great
fOrce. If you've been struggling with a problem or tough situation, this card can signal that
you will find the answer if you stand back and view everything fi-om a larger perspective .
The Wheel of Fortune also represents unexpected encounters and twists of fate. You can't
predict surprises; you can only be aware when one is circling around. Indeed, Card I 0 often
suggests wheel-like actions-changes in direction, repeating cycles, and rapid movement .
When the energy of the Wheel arrives, you will feel life speed up. You are caught in a cy­
clone that may deposit you anywhere . "Round and round and round she goes, and where she
stops, nobody knows."

justice
Description
On Card II we see the familiar figure of Justice. She has the scales of
equality and impartial judgment in one hand, and the sword of decision
in the other. In the tarot, Justice represents the understanding that life
is ultimately fuir and just. Even though the vagaries of day-to-day life can
make us doubt this fact, Justice reminds us that there is divine balance.
Notice the similarity between the Emperor and Justice. Both cards stand
for universal order; the Emperor in its underlying structure, Justice in
the action of karma-cause and effect.
There is a serious feel to Card li-the tone of the courtroom. This
card refers to legal matters of all kinds, but is not restricted to them. The 135
courts are where judgments are made and decisions rendered. Our legal system is the offi­
cial arena in which we explore the principles of Justice-fairness, impartiality. and the quest
for truth.
In readings, Justice often appears when you are concerned with doing what is right or
making sure you receive your due. This card can also appear when you are feeling the
impact of a past mistake or good deed. The cause you set in motion is now returning to
you as an effect.
Sometimes Justice is a signal to do what needs to be done. A time comes when responsi­
bilities must be accepted, and accounts settled. The past will continue to haunt you if you
do not recognize your mistakes and make amends for them. You will need to weigh matters
carefully and perhaps make important decisions about your future course.

The Hanged Man
Description
The Hanged Man is one of the most mysterious cards in the tarot deck.
It is simple, but complex. It attracts, but also disturbs. It contradicts it·
self in countless ways. The Hanged Man is unsettling because it symbol­
izes the action of paradox in our lives. A paradox is something that ap­
pears contradictory, and yet is true. The Hanged Man presents to us
certain truths, but they are hidden in their opposites.
The main lesson of the Hanged Man is that we "control" by letting
go-we "win" by surrendering. The figure on Card 12 has made the
ultimate surrender-to die on the cross of his own travails-yet he
shines with the glory of divine understanding. He has sacrificed himself. 137
but he emerges the victor. The Hanged Man also tells us that we can "move forward" by
standing still. By suspending time, we can have all the time in the world.
In readings, the Hanged Man reminds us that the best approach to a problem is not al­
ways the most obvious. When we most want to force our will on someone , that is when we
should release. When we most want to have our own way, that is when we should sacrifice.
When we most want to act, that is when we should wait. The irony is that by making these
contradictory moves, we find what we are looking for.

Death
Description
Death1 A powerful energy indeed. Who can look at the dark, skeletal
figure on Card 13 and not feel uneasy? Here we see the face of our deep­
est fear-our greatest unknown. We recoil from Death because we think
of it as annihilation. In the tarot (and in life I would suggest) Death is not
a permanent end, but a transition into a new state. Life is eternal in its
essence, if not in its furm. To grow, to move, to live-we must "die" to the
old to give birth to the new.
It is a truism in tarot work that Card 13 rarely has anything to do
with physical death. A responsible card reader never interprets Card 13
in this way because this view is too limiting. Death is not something that 139
happens once to our bodies. It happens continually, at many levels and not just in the physi­
cal. Each moment we die to the present so the future can unfOld.
In readings, Death often represents an important ending that will initiate great change. It
signals the end of an era, a moment when a door is closing. At such times, there may be sad­
ness and reluctance , but also relief and a sense of completion. Death also suggests getting
down to basics. Dying has a way of making you concentrate on what's important. This card
reminds you to cut out the unnecessary. Death can also mean you will experience an inexo­
rable furce. Death is inevitable, and sometimes there are events that are inescapable as well.
When these moments occur, the best approach is to ride your fate and see where it takes
you.

Temperance
Description
There are certain people who exude a kind of quiet composure. They
may not say much, but they go about their business with an air of calm
deliberation. Their presence is comforting because they are so centered.
For me, this is the energy of Temperan ce.
To be temperate is to show moderation and self-restraint. In a world
full of enticing indulgences, it is often necessary to find the middle
ground. Sensible, maybe, but also a bit boring? The energy of Temper­
ance may seem unexciting on the surface, but it is the calm of a
hurricane's eye. All around are swirling winds, but in the center is a still
point that brings everything into balance. 141
In readings, Temperance can represent a need fOr moderation, especially when extreme
cards are present (such as the Knights). This card can also indicate a need for balance. In
conflict situations, Temperance suggests that compromise and cooperation are vital. Look fOr
any opportunity to bring opposing parties together. In fact, to temper can mean to modifY
by adding a new component. By combining and recombining, we come up with the ideal
mixture or solution. Temperance is the card of good health in all areas-physical, mental, and
emotional. When illness or dis-ease is a concern, Temperance holds out the promise of vital­
ity and well-being.

The Devil
Description
Lucifer. Mephistopheles. Satan. The Prince of Darkness. No matter what
we call him, the Devil is our symbol for what is bad and undesirable.
From our human perspective, we see the world as a struggle between
light and dark. We want to vanquish the bad so the good can prevail. In
fact, good and bad cannot be separated, just as you cannot separate a
shadow fi-om its source. Darkness is simply the absence of light, and it
is caused by errors that hide the truth. Card 15 shows us these errors.
First is ignorance-not knowing the truth and not realizing we do not
know. Second is materialism-the belief that there is nothing but the
physical. As spiritual beings, we long for the Divine, but we lose contact 143
with this source of truth if we trust only our senses. There is also hopelessness, which robs
us of our joy and movement toward the light.
Traditionally the Devil stands for evil, but it does not have this rather frightening mean­
ing in a reading. This card lets you know that you are caught in an unhealthy, unproductive
situation. You may be in the dark about something-ignorant of the truth and its implications.
You may be obsessed by a person, idea, substance, or pattern that you know is bad for you
(or maybe you don't!). Sometimes this card reflects back the negativity that has made you
doubt yourself and your future. We are prone to many errors in life. Card 15 lets us know
when they are serious enough to require attention. When you see the Devil, examine your
assumptions carefully. Make sure you are not working fi-om a false picture of yourself and the
situation. Hold fast to the highest vision of who you are.

The Tower
Description
The Tower is an unsettling card. Fire, lightning, falling on jagged rocks­
definitely looks like trouble! Card 16 will not be welcomed by those
who dislike change. It represents a sudden, dramatic upheaval or rever­
sal in fortune. Usually change is gradual, giving us time to adapt, but
sometimes it is quick and explosive. This is the action of the Tower.
In films, the hero sometimes slaps someone who is groggy or bab­
bling. Having tried everything else, he finally resorts to a sharp sting to
snap him out of it. Sudden crises are life's way of telling you to wake up.
Something's wrong, and you're not responding. Are you too full of
pride7 Expect a blow to the ego. Are you holding back your anger? Ex­
pect the dam to burst. Are you stuck in a rut? Expect a surprise. 145
How you respond to the Tower's change makes all the difference in how uncomfortable
the experience will be. Recognize that the disruption occurred because it was needed. Per­
haps embracing the change is too much to ask, but try to find the positive in it. In fact, you
may feel tremendous release that you have finally been forced in a new direction . You may
have a burst of insight about your situation and reach a new level of understanding about it.

The Star
Description
People have always looked to the stars as a source of inspiration and
hope. There is something about their twinkling light that draws us out
of ourselves and up into a higher plane. When we turn our eyes heav­
enward, we no longer feel the distress of Earth. The Star reminds me of
the clear, high voice of a soprano. There is something otherworldly
about it. All the harshness and density of everyday life has been refined
away leaving only the purest essence. After being exposed to the Star, we
feel uplifted and blessed.
In readings, the Star is most welcome when grief and despair have
overwhelmed us. In our darkest moments , we need to know that there 147
is hope, that there is light at the end of the tunnel. The Star is the opposite of the Devil who
strips us of our faith in the future. Card 1 7 holds out the promise that we can eventually find
peace of mind. The Star also reminds us to open our heart and release our fears and doubt.
If you have been holding back in any way, now is the time to give generously.
It is important to remember that the Star is inspiring, but it is not a card of practical solu­
tions or final answers. Without hope we can accomplish nothing, but hope is only a begin­
ning. When you see Card 1 7, know that you are on the right track. Your goals and your
aspirations are blessed, but to realize them, you must take positive action. Use the light of
the Star to guide you in your efforts.

The Moon
Description
If you look around the room right now, you will (probably1) see people
and objects that are comfOrting in their familiarity. Everything is exactly
as you expect it to be. You know that if you closed your eyes and opened
them, the room would be the same. But ... have you ever lost the famil­
iar to find, in its place, a world so extraordinary you can't even grasp it1
This is the experience of the Moon.
Most of the time we live in a tiny pocket of normality that we wrap
around us like a security blanket. We turn our backs on the mysterious
universe that waits outside. From time to time we may sneak a peek
with our imagination , or venture out through fantasy or expanded 149
awareness. We can be thrust out there unprepared through drugs, madness, or intense expe­
riences such as battle.
The Moon is the light of this realm-the world of shadow and night. Although this place
is awesome, it does not have to be frightening. In the right circumstances, the Moon inspires
and enchants . It holds out the promise that all you imagine can be yours. The Moon guides
you to the unknown so you can allow the unusual into your life.
Sadly, we are usually afraid of the Moon. In readings, this card often stands for fears and
anxieties-the ones that come in the darkest part of the night. Card 18 also stands fur illu­
sions. It is easy to lose our way in the moonlight. Be careful not to let deceptions and false
ideas lead you astray. Sometimes the Moon is a signal that you are lost and wandering aim­
lessly. You must find your way back to the path and your clarity of purpose.

Description
Brilliant. Radiant. Sparkling . So many of our words reflect (!) the power
and glory of light. When we turn on the light in a room, we illuminate
it so all the dark corners are visible. When we turn on the light in our
minds, we are enlightened. We see clearly and understand the truth. Both
within and without, the energy of light expands our limits and makes
us shine.
Throughout history. people have honored the Sun as the source of
light and warmth. In the myths of many cultures, the Sun is a promi­
nent god-full of vigor and courage. He is the vital energy center that
makes life on Earth possible. In the tarot the Sun also symbolizes vital­
ity and splendor. The Sun is definitely not a meek and retiring card. 151

do you think and feel? You have total confidence in yourself You are not cocky. but pro­
fOundly sure of your power. You have unlimited energy and glow with health. You have a
greatness about you and stand out brilliantly . Finally. you see and understand all that is hap­
pening within your sphere. When you see this card, know that you will be successful at all
you undertake . Now is the time to let your light shine.

Judgement
Description
On Card 20, we see people rising up at the call of an angel. It is Judg­
ment Day, when the faithful are brought to heaven, but what about
those who are not saved? Have they been judged and found wanting7
For their sins, will they be denied the presence of God? It is this aspect
of judgment that is unsettling . How can judgment be reconciled with
furgiveness7
In fact, judgment comes in two furms. The hurtful kind says, "What
you did is wrong, and you are bad and worthless fur having done it." This
type of judgment separates and leaves no room for redemption. It is
possible to judge without condemning. We assess the matter, weigh all 153
sides and try to discern the truth. We recognize the need to choose and hope fur the cour­
age to do so wisely-but without blame.
In readings, Card 20 can be a reminder that judgments are necessary ; sometimes you must
decide. At such moments, it is best to consider the matter carefully and then commit your­
self without censure. If you are being judged yourself, learn fi-om the process. Take what is
of value, correct what needs correcting, but never lose sight of your worth.
Card 20 also stands for the feelings that come with salvation. When the angel calls, you
are reborn-cleansed of all guilts and burdens. The past and its mistakes are behind you, and
you are ready to begin anew. You may feel a calling-a personal conviction of what you are
meant to do. If you are in a low period, in need of hope and absolution, Judgement can show
that renewal is at hand.

T1ze World
Description
It's Thanksgiving Day. You've just finished a delicious meal, and there's a
hot mug of coffee in your hand. Friends and family are arguing about the
latest fiasco, the baby's cooing at you from across the table, and your feet
are rubbing the belly of a devoted mutt. You're happy. fulfilled, and truly
thankful (at least until you have to start the dishes!). For this moment,
the World and everything in it is yours.
We all recognize this feeling. It can come at any time or place and is
always welcome. We can feel it at home raking the leaves or on the world
stage accepting the Nobel Prize. It can seem quiet and simple, or wild
and glorious. What is this feeling, and where does it come from7 Card 21
can help us find out. 155
A major element of happiness is wholeness-the sense that everything is working together
in harmony. Not in a static way. but with dynamic balance. Involvement is also important. To
be happy. we must feel connected-engaged with what is around us. There is also accomplish­
ment-knowing that we have goals and are moving toward them successfully. When all these
elements come together, we feel fulfilled and blessed.
The World represents these moments and all that goes into them. In readings, it is a very
positive sign that you are in a position to realize your heart's desire. What that is fur you
depends on the situation, but it will always feel great. Remember, though, that Card 21 is a
symbol of active contribution and service. To hold the World in our hands, we must give of
ourselves to it. That is the source of true happiness.

Ace of Wands
Description
The Ace of Wands is a symbol of possibility in the area of creativity,
excitement, adventure, courage, and personal power. In readings, it
shows that a seed of bold enthusiasm has been planted in your life al­
though you may not yet recognize it. When the seed sprouts, it could
take almost any fOrm. It might be a creative idea, surge of optimism, or
need to act boldly. On the outside, it could be an offer, gift, opportunity,
encounter, or synchronistic event.
When you see this Ace, examine your life to see how its potent, con­
fident energy could work fur you. Be daring and brave. Sometimes you
have to risk to get what you want. Look fur the path that will excite you 161
and push you beyond your limits. Seize the initiative, and let your enthusiasm take you to
new heights. Wands are the suit of individual power and fulfillment. This Ace tells you that
a time of passion is beginning. You will be able to assert your best fur all to see.
The Ace of Wands is also the card of creativity. Under its influence, you can become a con­
duit fur inspiration and invention . Forget tired, worn-out solutions. You have the chance to be
original. Trust your own creative potential, and there will be no end to what you can achieve.

Two of Wands
Description
The Two of Wands glorifies individual courage and greatness. This card
taps the same energy as the Magician, but with one important differ­
ence. The Magician represents the archetype of power-the impersonal
energy of creativity and strength. The Two of Wands stands fur that
power brought down to Earth and made personal. Personal power is
an invigorating fOrce that fills you up and lends you the courage to be
great. A powerful person is like a magnet that attracts all those within
a certain area.
True power always comes from the Divine. It passes through us and
then flows out into the world. When we understand this relationship, 163
][
we are blessed because this flow brings with it a tremendous feeling of expansion and fulfill­
ment. We feel as if we can accomplish anything. Problems develop when we fOrget that we
are not the source of power, only its conduit. We must be careful not to let the intoxicating
feelings that come with power overwhelm our good sense and blind us to our true desires
and intentions.
In readings, the Two of Wands indicates that power is a major issue in the situation. You
or someone else has it or wants it. When you see this card, look carefully at your goals and
activities to make sure you are using power wisely. Don't support power fur its own sake, but
enjoy it when it serves your worthwhile purposes . Take this gift and use it to mold your en­
vironment in positive ways.
The Two of Wands can also stand fur an extra dose of daring and inventiveness. When you
see this card, trust that the time is right fur the bold, creative move that will knock their socks
off Forget subtlety and old, tired approaches. Allow yourself free rein and you'll be amazed
at the results.

Three of Wands
Description
On the Three of Wands, we see a figure standing on a cliff looking out
over the sea to distant mountains . From this height, he sees all that lies
ahead. This is a card of vision and foresight. When we want to see far­
ther, we climb higher. By going up, we increase our range and remove
ourselves from the immediate situation. We detach and gain perspective.
In readings, the Three of Wands can tell you to take the long view.
Don't react to the heat of the moment, but step back and reconsider.
See how the present fits into the greater picture. This card asks you to
be a visionary-to dream beyond current limitations . It can indicate
premonitions or other intuitions about what is to come. 165
Taking the long view is an aspect ofleadership-another meaning of the Three of Wands.
When we see far, we have the knowledge to guide others to their best future. Someone who
knows the way can show it to those who follow. When you see the Three of Wands, know
that now is the time to accept your vision and be confident that you can lead others to it.
A leader not only sees far, but he is willing to go there first, if necessary . The Three of
Wands is a card of exploration. Compare this figure to the Fool who is also on a cliff edge.
The Fool steps out in innocence , not realizing he is going to fall to his fate. The adventurer
on the Three of Wands is also willing to step out, but with full awareness of what he is do­
ing. His courage is more informed, ifless spontaneous. The Three of Wands encourages you
to move fearlessly into new areas. Let the ships on your horizon take you far out into un­
known seas.

Four of Wands
Description
Do you remember the thrill you felt as a child seeing your birthday
cake alight with candles? Or waiting to get on a roller coaster? Or slow
dancing with your first love? This bubbly, high-as-a-kite feeling lies at the
heart of the Four of Wands. As a toddler, my son expressed it through
his "happy dance." He'd run in place faster and faster, barely able to
control his delight. Of course, as mature(!) adults, we contain this feel­
ing, but it never leaves completely. Each of us still has an excited, little
kid inside waiting to come out.
In readings, the Four of Wands often represents the events and expe­
riences that generate excitement. These vary fi-om person to person, but 167
the stirring feelings are the same. Sometimes such times arrive unexpectedly. The Four of
Wands can signal a surprise or spontaneous thrill. Other times this card represents planned
celebrations, such as weddings, anniversaries, birthdays , and victory parties. These events have
their solemn side, but they are also a chance to feel the joy of living.
The Four of Wands often means fi-eedom. Freedom can take many forms, but it always
brings with it an exhilarating feeling. When we break the bonds that bind us, whether physi­
cal, mental, or emotional, we feel triumphant and able to move on to a new period of growth
and happiness. If you feel trapped or restricted right now, use the energy of the Four of
Wands to launch you into fi-eedom. Do not be afi-aid to claim the open vistas that are right­
fully yours.

Five of Wands
Description
You wake up and stub your toe going to the bathroom. You're in the
shower and find out there's no soap. At breakfast, you get juice on your
shirt. When you get to the car, your battery is dead. It's going to be a
terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.1 You're beset by hassles-those
petty annoyances that are infuriating because they are so minor.
The Five of Wands stands fur times when your environment seems
to be fighting you. Nothing flows smoothly; everyone is working at
cross-purposes. The figures on this card are all batting at each other.
There is no coordinated effurt, no agreement. When this card shows up,
be prepared fur a bumpy ride. You're going to need extra patience and 169
perseverance to get to the point where you can accomplish something. The Five of Wands
does not represent major blockages , just many small, irritating ones.
This card also stands fur competition. In the right circumstances, competition is useful. It
fOsters extra effurt, generates excitement, and encourages the best. When the Five of Wands
appears in a reading, check fur competitive elements. You may be involved in a contest, race,
or game. You may discover you have rivals who are opposing you or challenging your posi­
tion. You may feel disheartened (or invigorated~) by the dog-eat-dog environment you find
yourself in. At its heart, competition is divisive. Make sure it is helping you and others reach
your true goals. Otherwise, work toward cooperation .

Atheneum, 1972).

S;x of Wands
Description
The Six of Wands is the minor arcana counterpart of the Chariot. Both
of these cards represent moments of victory and triumph. Sometimes in
life, all we want to do is win-to be number one. You can see this dream
in the faces of athletes, politicians , and other champions as they step into
the winner's circle. It's all been worthwhile . I'm the best. I've won~
In readings, the Six of Wands appears when you have been working
hard toward a goal, and success is finally within reach. The recognition
you have sought so long is yours. You can receive the acclaim, honor, and
reward you deserve. If you do not feel close to victory now, know that
it is on its way provided you are doing all you can to make it happen. 171
The victory of this card does not have to involve beating someone else. You can triumph over
yourself, the environment , or the odds.
The Six of Wands also represents a healthy self-esteem. Feeling good about your accom­
plishments is an important part of success, but too much pride can lead to arrogance and self­
inflation. When you see this card, check that you are not feeling superior to others. It is easy
to forget that individual achievement is not really individual at all. Our talents begin in the
Divine, develop with the love and support of others, and only in the end express through us.
How can we indulge in excess pride?
In the Purgatorio Dante considers pride the first and greatest sin that must be overcome
by souls reaching toward heaven. When the Six of Wands appears, enjoy your triumph, feel
good about yourself, but remember Dante's words:
0 gifted men, vainglorious fOr first place,
how short a time the laurel crown stays green
A breath of wind is all there is to fume
here upon earth: it blows this way and that,
and when it changes quarter it changes name.l
I. Dante Alighieri, The Purgatorio , .John Ciardi, trans. (New York: New American Library, 195 7), p. 123.

Seven of Wands
Description
The Seven of Wands is about taking a stand. Taking a stand is a fOrceful
act that changes the energy flow of the world fur good or ill. Most of the
time we flow with our lives as if on a river. Events and feelings carry us
fOrward with little effurt. Sometimes, though, we are not content to drift.
We want to resist the flow, or change its course entirely~
The figure on the Seven of Wands appears to be in a battle. He's
either attacking or under attack, probably both. When we decide to
take a stand, we set in motion an energy of resistance. When we take up
a firm position, others do the same. The Seven of Wands stands fur ag­
gression and defiance because they are two sides of the same coin. You
attack; your opponent defends. He counterattacks; you defend. 173
Some battles are worth fighting, others just cause trouble. If you are involved in a conflict,
ask yourself if it's worth the struggle. Is it important? Does it have value 7 Will the outcome
serve you or others? If so, be bold and aggressive. Defend your position. Refuse to yield1 If not,
then consider letting the conflict go. Be honest with yourself about this. You will be tempted
to hold onto your position, especially if you have invested much time and energy into it.
Don't let battle lines be drawn unless the war is worth fighting.
The Seven of Wands can also indicate strong convictions. In order to take a firm stand, you
must believe in your position and yourself You'll need integrity and strength of character to
see you through. If your cause is just, use the energy of the Seven of Wands to make a difference.

E;ght of Wands
Description
In the film The Ten Commandments, Moses touches his staff to water to
set a plague in motion. His staff is the agent of power that initiates
events. Moses' staff reminds me of the wands on this card. They are a
symbol of the onset of action and its effects. BefOre acting, we think,
imagine, speculate, talk, and dream. This is the realm of air-the sky.
Then, finally. we make our move. We bring our ideas down to Earth and
put them into action.
In readings, the Eight of Wands is often a sign that now is the time
to declare yourself All the elements are ready and will work fOr you as
long as you don't hesitate. The iron is hot-so strike~ If events are in 175
motion, they will proceed rapidly. You may feel caught in a whirlwind, but soon the dust will
settle, and you will see how your plans have fared.
The Eight of Wands also stands fOr the arrival of news or infOrmation . You may see or hear
something important. The news could show up in a disguised fOrm, so stay alert. Pay atten­
tion to everything that comes your way fOr a while.
This card also signifies endings. Sooner or later, all activities run their course. The eight
wands on this card not only symbolize putting events into motion, but also bringing them
to a close. They appear to be ending their flight by coming down to Earth. If you see the
Eight of Wands in a reading, it may be time to conclude whatever you have been doing.
Celebrate the past, but prepare to move on to something new.

Nine of Wands
Description
The figure on the Nine of Wands has definitely been through tough
times. His head and arm are bandaged, and he's leaning on a "crutch."
This fighter has seen some battles, but he's still standing! He's hurt, but
he's not down. When we have had a bad experience, we feel weary and
battle-scarred . Even if we aren't hurt physically, our psyches are
wounded. Our openness, innocence, and trust are gone, replaced by
wary defensiveness .
In readings, the Nine of Wands can be a warning that you must pro­
ceed carefully. Keep a watchful eye because there is the possibility that
you will be hurt. If you have already been burned, you know what this 177
man is feeling. Life's lessons can be hard sometimes, especially when hopes have been dashed.
It is natural to feel defensive at such times, but try to avoid becoming bitter. Your experience
has wounded you, but it has strengthened you as well.
Strength is the other aspect of the Nine of Wands. This fighter is tough! He has the physi­
cal stamina and the inner drive to persist despite all setbacks. In The Terminator, Arnold
Schwarzenegger plays an android from the future who never gives up. In the end he is noth­
ing but a wire framework with glowing eyes, but he still keeps coming-dragging himself
along the floor to his goal. This is the spirit of the Nine of Wands. This card tells you to keep
going no matter what. Even if everyone and everything seems to be against you right now,
don't give up. Within you are the hidden reserves you need to prevail.

Ten of Wands
Description
On the Ten of Wands, we see a bent figure trying to carry ten heavy
poles. They are ranged so closely in front of him that he can't even see
where he's going. Nothing exists fOr this man except his burdens and
responsibilitie s. How true this is for so many today1 We take on so
much, trying to do all the things that need to be done. We think that
if we can hang on until the weekend (or vacation, or end of the semes­
ter) then we can finally relax. The weekend comes, and the overload
continues.
In readings, the Ten of Wands can be a sign that you are pushing
yourself too hard. If your days are an endless round of duties and tasks, 179
you need to lighten up fOr the sake of your health and well-being. Cut back, and take on only
those activities that give you pleasure. If you love your work, but it's all-consuming, you may
be too narrowly fOcused in one area. Balance your life with other interests.
The Ten of Wands can also stand fOr times when you have to assume the lion's share of
responsibility. You may be blamed or left holding the bag. On the other hand, you may have
to step fOrward and take charge because you are the only one capable enough. Rightly or
wrongly, the cleanup will full to you.
The Ten of Wands indicates that your life is going to be tougher than usual fOr a time. You
will have to fight uphill for every little gain. Each step will feel like a struggle. When you see
this card, be kind to yourself Lighten the load wherever you can, and let others help you.
You don't have to handle everything yourself

Two of Cups
Description
To understand the Two of Cups, all you have to do is look at its image.
A man and a woman are gazing at each other, ready to share their cups
(emotions). Here is the very picture of romantic and sexual attraction.
The energy between these two is almost palpable. The Two of Cups
shows the beauty and power that is created when two come together.
This is the card that lovers want to see, and, in fuct, the Two of Cups is
the minor arcana equivalent of the Lovers in many ways.
The Two of Cups has a deeper meaning as well. Whenever two forces
are drawn together, there is the potential for bonding. This card can
stand for the union of any two entities-people, groups, ideas, or talents. 191
In readings, the Two of Cups tells you to look for connections in your life, especially those
that are one-on-one. Now is not the time to separate or stay apart. It is the time to join with
another and work as a partnership. If you are in conflict, look for truce and the chance to
forgive and be forgiven. If you are struggling with two choices or tendencies within yourself.
seek to reconcile them.
Usually, the Two of Cups is welcome in a reading, but it can also sound a note of warning.
The energy of Two can be very compelling . If you have ever stood next to two people in love,
you know what I'm talking about. They create between themselves a world of their own that
can feel exclusionary to others. "Two's company, three's a crowd." Make sure that the ten­
dency to pair off is not creating disharmony in your situation.

Three of Cups
Description
There are three cards in the tarot that focus on the group-each from
a different point of view. For the Hierophant, it's the formal approach.
For the Three of Pentacles it's teamwork, and for the Three of Cups, it's
emotions. What does it feel like to join with others? What is friendship
and community J These are the questions answered by the Three of Cups.
On this card, we see three women dancing together in a circle. Their
arms reach out to each other to connect their feelings (Cups). In many
settings, women create and nurture the social glue that bonds people to­
gether. These dancing women are a symbol of coming together in love.
(Of course, these feelings do not only relate to women.) 193
In readings, the Three of Cups can signifY a friend or the feelings associated with friend­
ship. This card can represent community-the network of support created when we inter­
act with others. It can be a group in which the members feel a bond. When you see the
Three of Cups, examine your attachments to the groups in your life from an emotional point
of view. Consider reaching out to give or receive help. This card stands for all forms of sup­
port, including formal aid such as counseling and other social services.
The women on the Three of Cups also express joy and high spirits. Such feelings are not
limited to groups, but can be especially strong there. Celebrations spontaneously arise when
people feel connected, loved, and secure. The Three of Cups can stand for a mood or expe­
rience that makes you feel like dancing and singing.

Four of Cups
Description
Those who enjoy kayaking and other river sports know that there are ar­
eas of the river where the water flows in a dangerous circular motion. In­
stead of moving fOrward, it turns back on itself In the same way, we can
get stuck in emotional hydraulics . The Four of Cups represents such
periods of self-absorption.
If you are self-absorbed, you tend to refer everything back to your­
self-your own interests and desires. On this card, we see a man who is
unaware of the cup being offered to him. He misses this gift because he's
turned within. In readings, the Four of Cups can indicate that you are
wrapped up fOr the moment in your own world. 195
In some situations, you must fOcus on yourself When life is too stressful, you need to de­
vote time and energy to yourself or you will feel swamped . The Four of Cups can represent
a positive period of self-reflection and renewal. By taking the time to go within to dream,
muse, and reflect, you restore your emotional balance.
The Four of Cups is sometimes a sign of apathy. You don't really care much about any­
thing. Your life seems stale and flat because you've lost interest in the activities that used to
bring you pleasure. You're not motivated to make much of an ef!Ort in any direction. At such
times, the Four of Cups can show that you're stuck emotionally. You need something to fO­
cus on that will so engage your mind and heart that your path down river becomes clear
again. Open yourself to your surroundings. Soon you will be on your way again.

Five of Cups
Description
The Five of Cups is about loss. On this card, we see a figure draped in
black and covered in grief He so dominates the card that it is hard to
look beyond him. The Five of Cups refers to that time when the pain of
a loss is most acute. This man is looking only at the overturned cups in
ffont of him. For now, he cannot acknowledge the two cups that are still
standing. Later, when he has healed somewhat, he will be able to see all
that remains.
In readings, the Five of Cups can alert you to the possibility of a loss
and its associated emotions-sorrow, regret, denial. The loss could be
great or small. It could be tangible (money, possession, relationship, 197
y
work), or intangible (dream, opportunity, prospect, reputation). You may already know what
this card represents, but if not, use it as a warning to help you avoid a loss or reduce its toll.
You may feel discouraged by this card, but it does have a positive side. Every loss opens
new possibilities for growth because every loss initiates change. Loss hurts because it is our
emotional resistance to change. No matter how much we accept intellectually that we must
go with the flow, if that flow separates us h-om what we love, our feelings say, "No1"
In a story h-om Zen Flesh, Zen Bones,1 the master Hakuin is falsely accused of fathering a
child. He's ruined, but he accepts his loss and takes tender care of the child for a year. Sud­
denly, the real father appears, and just as willingly, Hakuin yields the child to its parents, ac­
cepting loss again. We who are not Zen masters may not flow quite so lightly with events,
but we can learn h-om this story. The more we struggle to keep what is gone, the more we
suffer.

Six of Cups
Description
In the film Parenthood there is a scene in which all the members of a
large family come together to witness a birth. As the camera moves from
person to person, we see as iffor the first time the uniqueness of each one.
The people talk and laugh, but suddenly their actions seem anything
but ordinary. There is a sweetness in the air that builds until we see its
very embodiment-the new baby. This is the spirit of the Six of Cups.
It is a truism that there is violence, anger, and mean-spiritedness in the
world. Certainly there is enough of this, but there is also much good will
and caring. A mother hands a drink to her child. A fiiend lends his car
for the weekend. A worker fills in for a sick colleague. Small gestures, 199
barely noticed, but so important. The Six of Cups is a card of simple goodness. It encourages
you to be kind, generous, and forgiving.
The Six of Cups also represents innocence-a word with many shades of meaning. You
can be innocent in the strictly legal sense of lack of guilt. You can be innocent of the truth­
unaware of some secret. You can be lacking in deceit or corruption-inno cent of ulterior
motive. Finally. you can be virtuous or chaste. These are all possibilities that can apply to the
Six of Cups, depending on the situation.
Notice that the two figures on the Six of Cups appear to be children. Often this card rep­
resents a baby or young child. In a larger sense, it embraces all of childhood and the feelings
we associate with youth (ideally1)-being carefree, playful, secure, and loved. Children are our
treasure, and the special sweetness of the Six of Cups is a quality to be treasured as well.

Seven of Cups
Description
As I gaze around the room right now, taking in the casual disarray, I
know the Seven of Cups speaks to me-fur better or worse. It says, "Yes,
order and hard work are nice, but ... isn't it more fun to just let every­
thing go)" Letting everything go is what the Seven of Cups is all about.
It's easy to worship the gods of efficiency and neatness. We like trim
lawns, alphabetized filing systems, and time management-the world of
the Emperor. We admire order in all its fOrms and want everything to
be just right. The Seven of Cups provides the balance. This card stands
fur all that is sloppy, impractical, and lax.
When the Seven of Cups appears in a reading, it is important to look 201
carefully at how disordered your situation is. Is everything too controlled and regular? Perhaps
you need to let things fall apart a little. When a rigid system breaks up, there can be a tremen­
dous release of creativity. The man on the Seven of Cups is amazed by all the options he has.
On the other hand, if you are in a chaotic situation, some tightening may be necessary. No
one is happy and productive in a crazy environment. Regularity gives structure to life. Taken
to an extreme, the looseness of the Seven of Cups can lead to harmful patterns of decadence,
addiction, and self-indulgence.
Sometimes the laziness applies to your thoughts and dreams. It is easy to wish fur some­
thing, but not so easy to make that wish come true. When you see this card, make sure that
you are backing up your plans with work and effOrt. Tighten up your life and commit to
doing what it takes to reach your goals ... even if it means (sigh) cleaning house.

Eight of Cups
Description
A psychologist friend once told me that when a group is ready to break
up, the members give off subtle signs to that effect. They display a cer­
tain restlessness . They arrive late to meetings, communicate less, and
seem distracted. At some level the participants know it is time to move
on, but they need a while to work up to that final step.
This process applies in many situations where an ending is approach­
ing. Nothing is permanent in life. Sooner or later, everything slips away
... or we slip away from it. The Eight of Cups stands for those moments
when we realize, once and for all, that the past is gone. What was true
is no longer true. The signs of change are in our fuce, and we must ac­
cept them. It is time to move on. 203
Moving on can mean a physical change such as leaving a job, location, or relationship. It
can also mean an inner change-releasing old patterns, especially those that have dominated
our thoughts and emotions. On the Eight of Cups, we see a man leaving on a journey. He has
turned away from his old feelings (cups/river) to strike out on a new path. Sometimes mov­
ing on can mean searching for a deeper truth or reality. One day we wake up and realize that
we have been asleep in our own lives-living a dream that no longer satisfies.
Some changes can be wearying . Endings are not always easy. One of the signs of a readi­
ness to leave is lack of energy. When you feel tired and dispirited, you know that something
is wrong, and it's time for a new direction. Reexamine your life and your priorities. You will
find where in your life you need to move on.

Nine of Cups
Description
The man on the Nine of Cups reminds me of"the cat who ate the canary."
Now, a canary is a pet strictly off limits to hungry felines. Any cat who
manages to catch one is going to feel pretty smug about it. This is the
feeling tone of the Nine of Cups-pure indulgence and self-satisfaction.
At the physical level, the Nine of Cups is a sign of delight in all the
senses. Sights, sounds, tastes, feelings. This card encourages you to seek
pleasure and enjoy your body in every way. You can commune with the
natural world as well-the body of Mother Earth. She, too, delights in
sharing her abundance.
At the personal level, the Nine of Cups indicates contentment with 205
the way things are. Notice how the man is seated confidently with his arms fulded and a smile
on his fuce. He has everything he wants and couldn't be happier about it. "See all my cups1"
he seems to say. "Aren't they great?"
Sometimes it's wonderful to sit back and revel in the knowledge that all's right with the
world. But a word of caution. You may be tempted to indulge yourself at the cost of some­
one else Oike our mischievous cat!). This may feel great at the time, but sooner or later the
feathers around your mouth will be discovered, and regret will set in. Pursuit of pleasure
without regard to consequences is never satisfYing in the long run.
In many tarot traditions, the Nine of Cups is known as the Wish Card. It shows your wish
will come true. A wonderful prospect, but remember your fairy tale lessons. You must be
sure you know what you really want and accept the responsibilities that go with your wish.
If that is the case, then enjoy your good furtune1

Ten of Cups
Description
On the Ten of Cups we see a loving couple with their carefree children.
The family home is in the background, surrounded by trees and water.
A rainbow of cups is overhead blessing the scene. A cynic might scoff
at this romantic picture, but I see it as a symbol of what our emotional
life could be at its best. The feelings represented here are an ideal that
is within the reach of each of us.
First, there is joy. Joy goes beyond happiness, contentment, enjoy­
ment. It is the feeling that comes when we know at the deepest level
that we are one with all that is, and it is good. UnfOrtunately, this is not
exactly a common feeling~ Too often we are blinded by the trials of life
and overwhelmed by their challenges. Joy exists, though, and is our birthright. 207
Peace is another aspect of the Ten of Cups-the serenity that comes when all elements
are in harmony. There is inner peace and outer peace, which are reflections of each other.
When you are in harmony with yourself, you experience harmony in your environment.
When you see the Ten of Cups, know that an end to hostility is possible. If there is fighting
around you, it may cease. If you are at war with yourself, you may find peace.
In readings, this card often signals a time of abundant blessings. It tells you that you can
reach fur the fulfillment you deserve, and it will come to you. Look fur ways to realize joy
and create peace. You may find the key to happiness in your family. Your family is the group
of people you are attached to emotionally- fur better or worse1 If there is trouble in your
family right now, work to restore harmony. The time is right fur greater closeness.

a lover of all things romantic and refined. He uses his imagination in
wondrous ways and taps the deepest levels of emotion. He knows how
to create beauty and share it with others. On the negative side, this

Are your daydreams unrealistic? Is someone 's moodiness driving you crazy? Is your home life
ruled by emotion rather than common sense 7 It may be time fOr a change.
If this Knight's energy is missing, a dose of poetry may be called fOr. Are you too re­
strained7 Express your feelings. Do you always make the most practical choice7 Go fOr the
extravagant one instead. Do you avoid introspection? Take some time to look within and

Two of Swords
Description
On the Two of Swords, we see a young woman who has put a barrier
of swords across her heart. Her rigid posture tells us of her struggle to
keep her feelings under control. She is fending off any approach from the
outside. "Nothing comes in, and nothing goes out," she seems to say.
The Two of Swords is about the barriers we put up between our­
selves and others and those we create within ourselves. Internally, we
block off emotions and refuse to feel them. We avoid looking at the truth
and pretend that everything's OK. We think one way, but feel another.
In countless ways, we divide off parts of ourselves and try to maintain
them even when we know they need to be reconciled . 219
In readings, the Two of Swords often appears when you are not willing to accept some
truth about yourself or the situation. What are you really feeling? Are you resisting tender
feelings because you might be hurt? Are you furious even though you're smiling"' What are
you refusing to look at? Notice the blindfOld on this woman. She can't look at the truth or
even acknowledge that there is trouble.
The most common barrier is a closed heart. When we cut ourselves off emotionally, we
sever the connection that allows our love to flow outward. Sometimes this action is neces­
sary, but it always comes at a great price. Every time we close off our heart, we find it more
difficult to open again.
Another barrier between people is a deadlocked situation. When two parties are set in
their positions-cut off from each other-there is a stalemate. To break it, the "opponents"
must come out from behind their swords and listen to each other. The lesson of the Two of
Swords is that barriers are not the answer. We must stay open if we are to find peace and
wholeness.

11zree of Swords
Description
You open the door to find your partner in the arms of someone else. You
overhear your best friend laughing at you behind your back. You find
out your business partner has been cheating you fOr years. All of a sud­
den your world is turned upside-down. You're stunned, disbelievin g, and
finally heartbroken .
The image on the Three of Swords clearly describes this sudden pain.
You literally feel as if someone has taken a sharp object and jabbed it
through your heart. Even something as minor as a snippy remark can
feel this way. Notice how this card contains just a heart and three swords.
When your heart is breaking, you feel as if that is all you are-an open
wound. 221
In readings, the Three of Swords often represents the nasty little curve balls that life can
throw sometimes. Betrayal, abandonment, rejection, separation , a reversal of fortune. These
hurts are painful because they hit you when you least expect them. If you have drawn this
card, you may know what it refers to, but if not, the Three of Swords is a valuable warning.
It is likely there is something amiss in your life that you are unaware of or unwilling to ac­
knowledge. Curve balls hit us when we're looking the other way. Examine your situation
carefully. Talk to the people in your life. Don't take anything fOr granted. Listen to your in­
ner voice; it will help you locate the problem.
It is also possible that you are contemplating hurting someone else. With this card I think
it is important to remember that each of us is capable of cruelty. We're all human, and we
all make mistakes, sometimes serious ones. In the end, all we can do is trust in the goodness
of life and try to live up to that ideal. When you slip, fOrgive yourself. and try to fOrgive oth­
ers in turn, but, even better, head off trouble befOre it arrives.

Four of Swords
Description
The Swords cards all stand fur trials of some kind, but the Four suggests
feelings of peace and stillness. Why is this card different? Because it rep­
resents the challenge to be quiet1 Sometimes resting and doing nothing
is the ultimate challenge . Activity can be a habit that is very difficult to
break. There is always so much to do, and modern society beguiles us
with its attractions and distractions. The result is that we fOrget to stop
and be still.
In readings, the Four of Swords is often a sign that you need to slow
down and get some rest. If you are recovering from an illness, allow
yourself quiet time to heal. Even if you feel healthy. you are risking get­
ting sick if you don't take a break. 223
The Four of Swords also represents taking time to think things over without hurry. It is
important to step back and gain perspective . This is especially true when you are facing an
ordeal or big event. You need quiet preparation time to gather your strength and center your
energy. Picture an Olympic diver on the high board. She doesn't climb the ladder and then
dash out. She stops, motionless as she readies herself for the burst of activity to come. This
is the only way to bring the best to our endeavors .
Sometimes the Four of Swords implies that you are or could be shifting fucus from the
external to the internal. When we are silent, we can more easily go within. The knight in the
picture appears to be praying or meditating deeply. Actually. he appears to be dead! For those
who are addicted to activity. rest and quiet can seem like death, but that is certainly not the
case. Stillness has its own rewards, but they must be recognized and sought.

Five of Swords
Description
The Five of Swords is about self-interest. Society tells us to think of oth­
ers, yet we resist. How can we ignore our own concerns and still survive 1
This dilemma comes &om our definition of self If we view our self as our
personality /body. our interests become those that relate to that self Do
I have enough to eat? Am I happy 1 Do I have all I want'
We may expand our concern to those we love, but, then, how can we
stop there 1 We are connected to everyone in the long run. In truth, our
self is the world. What we do to that world, we do to ourselves . This un­
derstanding is so basic, but so infuriatingly easy to forget day-to-day.
In readings, the Five of Swords can mean that you or someone else is 225
forgetting this larger view of self You are defining your interests too narrowly. If you try to
get ahead in isolation, your actions will come back to haunt you, one way or the other.
Sometimes this card implies a need to put your own interests first. If you are being abused
or taken advantage of. you must get tree. If you are worn out by demands, take care of your­
self If it is your turn, step forward and claim your due. Just be aware that if you hurt others
in the process, your victory will not feel complete.
The Five of Swords also represents hostility-from a cross word to warfure. When the
cords that bind us are broken, we experience dis-cord. This card can signifY dishonors that
are fuirly open. Cheats, lies, tricks, even crimes. You may be on the receiving end, or the per­
petrator. Either way. hold to a larger view of who you are. Find the solution that is best for
everyone ... including yourself

Six of Swords
Description
At one point in The Pilgrim's Progress, the hero Christian (who is also
on a Fool's Journey) becomes mired in the Slough of Despond. He
struggles fur a time until drawn out by Help. Help tells him that" ... many
fears, and doubts, and discouraging apprehensions ... settle in this place."1
The Slough of Despond is a good name fur the Six of Swords. Some­
times this card represents a dull, listless state. Nothing is seriously wrong,
but nothing is really right either. You're getting by, but not thriving. In
the picture the figures in the boat seem sad and disengaged. Life is in­
deed uninteresting when we feel the blues.
In a more positive vein, the Six of Swords can indicate recovery. This 227
is especially true when you have just experienced a tough time or psychological blow. Dur­
ing the crisis, you felt numb and disconnected; nothing mattered at all. Now you are begin­
ning to heal and pick up the pieces of your life. The travelers in our boat are at least moving
furward. They are headed toward a new place, even if they are not yet ready to eagerly em­
brace those shores.
In fuct, the Six of Swords can indicate travel and moves of all kinds. This could mean an
actual change of scene, relocation , or trip, but not necessarily. A journey can also take place
on the inner planes as we move from one frame of mind to another.
Although the Six of Swords does not promise great joy, it also avoids the depths of despair.
A slough is not a bottomless pit, but simply a hollow or depression. When you see this card,
know that even though the situation is not ideal, you are moving toward a more positive
place. Change is in the air, and new, more hopeful conditions lie ahead.

Seven of Swords
Description
The Seven of Swords is tied to the Five of Swords because both involve
separation from others. On the Seven we see a man tiptoeing away &om
society (the colorfUl pavilions). He's taken some swords and seems rather
pleased with his successful heist. He gives the impression of having se­
cret, solitary plans.
This card sometimes represents the "lone-wolf' style-the desire to
run lone and ffee. In films, the lone-wolf hero always acts totally on his
own. He discovers, investigates and solves every problem using only his
own wits and resources. He believes he's successful because he ignores
the fumbling efforts of ordinary people. 229
In readings, the Seven of Swords can be a sign that you or someone else wants to be a lone
wolf You feel that you will be more effective and comfortable on your own. This approach is
useful when you need to bypass an ineffectual group or assert your independence, but it can
also be troubling. We can not be happy and productive fur long without some commitment to
others. If you feel inclined to act alone, make sure this isolation is really working fur you.
Sometimes the Seven of Swords means that you are running &om something-commit­
ment, responsibility, hard work, love. You may be procrastinating, letting problems slip be­
cause you don't want to deal with them. Sometimes we just have to fuce what has to be fuced.
The Seven of Swords lets you know when you are making things worse fur yourself and
others by running away.
The Seven of Swords can also indicate a hidden dishonor-a choice you or another has
made that does not do justice to the highest. We all make wrong choices that we want to
hide. Some of these are minor, some serious. Your inner voice will tell you when this is hap­
pening. When you see the Seven of Swords, take a good look at what you're doing because
hidden dishonors will eat away at your happiness and self-respect.

cause she is blindfolded . She can't reach out because she is bound. She
can't move freely because she is caught in a prison of swords. It seems
she has wandered fur from home-her place of security fur away on the
hill. How can she get back? She doesn't know which way to go. The
Eight of Swords stands for those times when we feel lost, confused and
powerless. Help and relief seem very fur away.
Sometimes we feel restricted by circumstances. We wake up one day
in an impossible situation. A dead end job. A troubled relationship .
Mountains of debt. How did this happen"' We have no idea. Even little 231
problems can make us feel trapped. There just doesn't seem to be a way out. Other times
life seems fine-on the surface. "I have everything I want. I should be happy. so what's the
problem?" We just don't know. We're confused and unsure.
In readings, the Eight of Swords is often a sign that you are heading toward (or already in)
a situation in which you will feel a lack of freedom and choice. Such situations are tricky
because the more you get into them, the more restricted you feel. At each step, your options
seem to narrow until you feel completely stuck.
When you see this card, remember that you do have choices, and you do have power. No
matter how trapped you feel, you can find a way out if you believe it is possible. The young
girl in the picture could free herself She could wriggle free, tear off the blindfold, and kick
down those swords. Solutions are not always easy. but they exist. Find your clarity of thought
and purpose (the Swords ideal) and use them to take that first step toward home.

N;ne of Swords
Description
It makes sense that the figure on the Nine of Swords is in bed because
it is during the night that our griefS and regrets come to mind most in­
tensely. The quiet darkness strips away the distractions of the day, leav­
ing us alone with our thoughts. Who has not lain awake at 4 A.M. filled
with worries that refuse to go away 1 The Nine of Swords represents this
unhappin ess which can strike at any time.
Unlike the pain of the Three of Swords, which seems to come from
without, the Nine of Swords represents the pain that we generate from
within. What tortures we put ourselves through when our fears and
doubts overwhelm us. Worry is probably the most common. Have I 233
done enough' Will everything work out OK1 What am I going to do1 The thoughts go
round and round-impossible to turn off.
Guilt is another source of pain. When we have done something that we feel is wrong or
hurtful-or failed to do something we think we should have-the distress can be very real.
It is worse when nothing we do relieves the bad feelings or makes them go away. Finally, there
is just pure anguish. Sometimes the pain oflife is so total that all we feel like doing is crying
into our hands.
Needless to say, the Nine of Swords is not the most pleasant of cards, but it doesn't always
indicate major distress. Often it is just a sign of some element of unhappiness or trouble-a
vulnerable spot in your life. This card is often a warning from your Inner Guide that the path
you are going down may be a difficult one. If you approach the Nine of Swords in this spirit­
as a caution sign-you will be able to use it constructively. Examine your situation carefully
to be sure you are making the best choices. Even a small change can make all the difference.

Ten of Swords
Description
The Ten of Swords appears to be a card of terrible misfOrtune, but sur­
prisingly, it often represents troubles that are more melodramatic than
real. The man on this card has quite a few swords in his back. Wouldn't
one be enough' Isn't ten a little excessive' Perhaps this gentleman's suf­
fering-though sincere-is exaggerated as well.
One meaning of the Ten of Swords is hitting rock bottom. When one
disaster follows another, we feel devastated at first, but eventually we
throw our hands up and laugh. It's so bad, it's funny1 In films, the hero
says, "What else could possibly go wrong?" and we know that's a signal
for the bucket of water to fall on his head. When you see the Ten of
Swords, know that the last bucket has fallen, and you can expect a turn fur the better. 235
This card can also show when you're in victim mentality. You're certain that the whole
world is picking on you just to make your life difficult. I picture the man lifting his head and
saying, "You think you've got it bad ... a cut on the finger. I've got ten swords in my back ..
. count 'em-ten~ Then he drops his head back down with a sigh. When we're in victim men­
tality, we think everything is horrible, hopeless, and impossibly unfair.
Being a martyr is also a favorite Ten of Swords activity. In this case, the man would say with
a weak wave of his hand, "No ... you go on. Have fun. Don't think about me. I'll just stay here
with these swords in my back ... but I want you to enjoy yourself" Being a martyr in this
sense is not the same as making a sacrifice fur another with no strings attached. With the Ten
of Swords, either is possible, but doing a good turn fur someone else is more satisfYing with­
out the strings.
I don't mean to make light of misfOrtunes because, of course, there are many real tragedies
in the world. Sometimes the Ten of Swords indicates a sad event, but you know when this is
the case. There is not even a hint of laughter in your heart. Most of the time the Ten of
Swords has a lighter side. It is as if your Inner Guide is gently kidding you about how you
are handling your own personal tale of woe. When you see the Ten of Swords, check your
attitude and know you've reached the point where things will definitely begin to look up.

son. He has a keen intellect that grasps the fine points of any subject. He

others? Do you get in trouble fur saying what you think7 Is your partner too cold and aloof?

livo of Pentacles
Description
In the film First Knight, Lancelot takes on a challenge-to move down a
line of swinging blades crossing in front of him at random intervals. He
succeeds because he is alert, agile, and patient. He knows when to move
and when to stay still. He glides through the dangers enjoying every
moment of this deadly obstacle course. Lance lot has tapped the energy
of the Two of Pentacles.
There is nothing quite like the feeling of being graceful and effective
at the same time. On the Two of Pentacles we see a young man dancing
as he juggles his worldly concerns. The infinity sign loops around the two
pentacles to suggest that he could handle unlimited problems. In the 247
J[
background we see two ships riding the waves easily-cruising the ups and downs of life.
In readings, the Two of Pentacles lets you know that you can juggle all demands made
upon you. In fact, you will relish the excitement of every hurdle. If you do not feel this level
of confidence right now, this card asks you to believe in yourself You have all you need to
meet your every goal and more. Embrace the challenge.
The Two of Pentacles also reminds you to be flexible. Lancelot could not have navigated
the swords walking in a straight line. He had to move freely and lightly in all directions as
needed. You too must be supple if you want to prevail. Don't furce your way through or you
will be cut down. Now is not the time to be rigid. Know that sometimes a side step, or even
a back step is the surest way fOrward.
The Two of Pentacles is also a symbol of fun, laughter, and good times. It is definitely a
high-energy card. If you are feeling tired or depressed, this card may be a sign that greater
vitality will be yours. If you are feeling revved already. the Two of Pentacles could be a warn­
ing against overstimulation. Be sure you get the rest you need so that you can enjoy the up
energy of this card.

Three of Pentacles
Description
In the TV show Mission Impossible, a crack team of specialists is always
given a dangerous assignment. The team has to map out a strategy. co­
ordinate resources, and draw on their skills and ingenuity to complete
the mission. This is the Three of Pentacles in action: teamwork , planning,
and competence .
The Three of Pentacles is one of the cards in the tarot that fOcuses
on the group. (The Three of Cups and the Hierophant are the others.)
As Pentacles are grounded and practical, this card represents a task­
oriented team-people who are working cooperatively toward a com­
mon goal. There are few jobs that can be accomplished alone. We need 249
the help of others to achieve our goals. Sometimes the Three of Pentacles is a sign that you
will be more productive if you work with others. You don't have to do it all by yourself
This card can also show a need fur planning and preparation . Now is not the time to rush
into something or begin a project with only a vague idea of what it's about. You need to think
everything through, go over all the possibilities, and make sure you work out the details. Do
your homework and your undertaking will flourish.
Another feature of the Three of Pentacles is competence-the ability to get the job done.
How rare this is nowadays! This card tells you that you have the skills and knowledg e you
need. You can attract capable people and create a successful environment. Know that the
situation is (or will be) in good hands, but be sure to concentrate on excellence in your work.
Be proud of what you do and how you do it. Then you will accomplish your "impossible"
mission.

Four of Pentacles
Description
Spend time with a 2-year-old, and you will soon hear the sounds of the
Four of Pentacles: "Nol'' and "Mine~" These are the cries of the ego,
which is just developing in the young child. The ego tries to guarantee
power by imposing its wilL The desire fur control is the hallmark of the
Four of Pentacles.
Some control is valuable. In chaotic situations , a firm hand is needed
to provide structure and organization. Too often, however, the urge fur
control gets out of hand, stifling creativity and individual expression. In
readings, this card asks you to weigh carefUlly the level of control in your
situation. 251
The Four of Pentacles can stand fur issues of ownership . You may be involved in getting
and keeping money or some other commodity . You may be having problems with possessive­
ness or jealousy. Use the energy of this card to preserve and defend, but not to lay claim.
People need to be free to determine their own lives.
The Four of Pentacles also implies blocked change. It's as if the stubborn little man on the
card is thwarting your every move. Opposition may come from those who want to maintain
the status quo. It may also come from within yourself Are you resisting change that is truly
needed' We often cling to the familiar even when we know it's not fur the best.
The lesson of the Four of Pentacles is that control is impossible . We stand in the world as
in a great ocean. Who could manage or possess such power' The only way to keep from
drowning is to ride the currents. The ocean will support us as long as we swim with the flow.

J1ive o/ J>entacles
Description
The two figures on the Five of Pentacles are cold, hungry, tired, sick, and
poor. They show us what it feels like to be without-to lack the basic
ingredients oflife. This is the specter that haunts so many in our world­
a reality that is all too immediate. Those of us who are more fOrtunate
may not have experienced this extreme, but we still recognize suffering.
When we do not have what we want and need, it hurts.
In readings, the Five of Pentacles can represent several kinds of lack.
First, there is poor health. It is hard to tackle life's challenges when we
do not have our vitality and strength. This card can be a signal that you
are neglecting the needs of your body. You are moving away from com­
plete physical well-being, so you must take steps to discover and correct the problem. 253
This card can also be a sign of material and economic setbacks. There is no doubt that life
is harder when we lack money or a decent job. When we are struggling to make ends meet,
all other problems are magnified. Even if we are comfOrtable, we can still feel insecure, afraid
that misfOrtune will take away all that we have worked fur.
The Five of Pentacles can also represent rejection or lack of acceptance . We are social ani­
mals and feel pain when excluded from our group. We want to be included, not only fur our
emotional well-being, but also fur mutual support. Being rejected can mean physical hardship
as well.
The Five of Pentacles relates to material lack, but it also has a spiritual component. From
the stained glass window, we can guess that these two figures are outside of a church. Com­
fOrt is so close at hand, but they fail to see it. The church symbolizes our spirits which are
perfect and whole in every way. We are meant to enjoy abundance in all areas of life, but
sometimes we forget that this is our birthright. Whenever you experience hardship, know
that it is only temporary. Look for the spiritual center that will take you in and give you
shelter.

Opposing Cards and Reinforcing Cards: Some Possibilities
Opposing and reinfOrcing cards do not work in the usual way with the Six of Pentacles be­
cause this card can mean either (or both) sides of the same issue-having or not having. The
other cards in a reading can help you figure out which side applies in your case. The fOllow­
ing cards also deal with this issue:
Empress-abundance, physical comfOrt
World-affluen ce, material fulfillment
Ten of Wands-struggling to make ends meet, hard times
Five of Pentacles-lack , not having
Seven of Pentacles-material reward, having
Ten of Pentacles-affluence , having
Six of Pentacles
Description
The Six of Pentacles is a difficult card to describe because it fulls in the
shadowy area between the lack of the Five of Pentacles and the affluence
of the Ten of Pentacles. These two cards represent the extremes of not
having and having. The Six of Pentacles covers the huge middle ground
where it is not exactly clear who has what.
On this card, a well-to-do gentleman is tossing a few coins to a beg­
gar while another supplicant waits to the side. The giver holds the scales
of justice as if claiming the right to decide who deserves blessings and
who does not. In this picture we see both sides: what it means to give
and to receive, to dominate and to submit, to be on top and to be on 255
the bottom. It seems clear who has and who hasn't, but is it? Life is not that simple, and how
quickly fortunes change.
In readings, the Six of Pentacles asks you to look very deeply into the whole issue of what
having really means both materially (resources) and immaterially (knowledge , power, love).
You may see yourself on one side or the other, but this card asks you to reconsider . Think
of the successful businessman who suddenly declares bankruptcy . The tyrannical invalid who
dominates through weakness. The teacher who learns from her students. The parent who
controls by giving money.
The keywords for the Six of Pentacles include both the have and have not sides of each
meaning. Sometimes this card is a clear sign one way or the other. You will get the gift, give
advice or defer to another. In all cases, though, you should question the obvious and go
deeper. Why are you in the situation you're in, and where is it leading? Who is really in
charge' What's really going on?

Seven of Pentacles
Description
On the Seven of Pentacles we see a man who has labored long and hard
in his garden. The fOliage is full, the blossoms are out-it seems that his
work has paid off Now he's taking a break to admire his handiwork.
How satisfying it is to see such results~ How rewarding is sweet success1
The Seven of Pentacles is a time-out card. It represents those mo­
ments after a rush of activity when we stop to catch our breath and look
around. The man in the picture has paused to contemplate the fruits of
his own labors, but he could also pick that fruit. In readings, the Seven
of Pentacles can indicate a reward that will come your way, particularly
as a result of your own efforts. Take it and enjoy. 257
This card is also a call fOr assessment. When we're busy, we don't take time to reflect
on what we're doing and why. Are we still on course? Are we getting the results we want'
Serious problems can develop if you don't take stock at key moments. This card asks you to
take the time to be sure you're meeting your goals.
The Seven of Pentacles can also indicate a crossroads. In life, there's a tendency to continue
with familiar routines. To go in a new direction isn't easy. The Seven of Pentacles may be tell­
ing you to figure out if you need a course correction, or even a complete about-face. You're
not yet committed to a certain path, but you could be soon. Change is still possible.
The Seven of Pentacles is not a card of endings or final decisions. The game is not over, but
only on hold fOr a moment. Once you've gotten your breath back and checked your strat­
egy, be ready to jump back in and work even harder than befOre.

Eight of Pentacles
Description
On the Eight of Pentacles we see a young man who is hammering away
at a coin. He has finished six and has another coin to go. It is clear that
he is in the middle of a project that absorbs all his attention. He's isolated
himself from others (the town in the background) in order to concen­
trate. In this scene we see the essential elements of the Eight of Pentacles:
hard work and attention to detail.
This card often implies a time of great diligence and fOcus. It advises
you to hammer away at the business of the moment, whether a project,
family difficulty. personal goal, or unpleasant duty. Sometimes blessings
fall into our laps to be enjoyed. Other times we must put out great ef­259
fOrt to obtain them. The Eight of Pentacles represents moments when you must give II 0
percent. Just buckle down and do it. Fortunately. this kind of work is invigorating and leads
to superb results. The labor of the Eight of Pentacles is deeply satisfYing and productive.
The Eight of Pentacles can also symbolize the impulse to learn-to broaden horizons (to
use an old-fashioned term). Sometimes we need to develop new skills. We do research, dig out
facts, or search fur greater expertise . The Hermit is looking fur inner knowledge. The man
on the Eight of Pentacles seeks external knowledge-the how and why of the material world.
This card can also show the need fur meticulous attention. People who are painstaking are
often dismissed as nitpickers, but their extra eflOrt ensures everything is as it should be. It's
a matter of caring-taking the time to check the little details. Now is not the time to be slip­
shod or casual. Look for errors, and tie up loose ends. The key to success is an extraordinary
effort. Whatever your task, the Eight of Pentacles tells you to give it your all in every way.

N;ne of Pentacles
Description
The woman on the Nine of Pentacles is taking a leisurely stroll through
the gardens of her estate. She is clearly a lady of refinement and grace,
so it is incongruous to see on her left hand a bird trained to hunt and
kill on command. Falconry is an unusual hobby fur a gentlewoman, but
it is the key to the special nature of this card.
On one hand, the Nine of Pentacles represents all that is gracious,
high-minded, and civilized. Art, music, and other forms of beauty are
very much part of our physical world (Pentacles) . Coins are present in
this scene, but they are toward the ground. The business oflife is impor­
tant, but we don't have to fucus on practical matters all the time. We can 261
enjoy the finer things of life. In readings, the Nine of Pentacles can imply an interest in these
areas. It is also a sign that you may need to reject the coarse or offensive and seek the highest.
The Nine of Pentacles can also be a sign of discipline and self-control. This woman enjoys
her cultured life because she has mastered her baser instincts. Her impulses work fur her
because they do not rule her. The fulcon symbolizes all that is dark and unruly in human
nature. Our shadow side can serve us well, but only when it is directed. Sometimes the Nine
of Pentacles suggests that you must show restraint and self-control if you are to achieve your
best effOrts. You may have to "sacrifice" for the moment, but the results will be worth it.
This card is also a sign of self-reliance. Sometimes you must trust your own ability to
handle a situation. Resist the temptation to let others do fur you. You need to take matters
into your own hands. Our elegant lady has done just that. She trusted in her own grit and
determination, and now she enjoys all the best life has to offer.

Ten of Pentacles
Description
On many cards, we see a cluster of buildings off in the distance. In the
Ten of Pentacles, we finally arrive in that village-in the middle of the
marketplace. The family we see is carrying on the affuirs of everyday life.
A patriarch, dressed in a luxurious robe, pats his hounds as he watches
over the younger generations. A man and woman converse in passing as
their child plays at their feet. Coins (money) are in the air.
The Ten of Pentacles stands fOr the ultimate in worldly and material
success. Sometimes I jokingly call it the "fat cat" card because it reminds
me of the aura of prosperity that surrounds wealthy men and women
of business. This is the card you want to see if you are wondering how
your latest enterprise will turn out. Wealth and affluence are yours. 263
When we achieve material success, we naturally want it to last. This is the conservative,
Establishment side of the Ten of Pentacles. Why rock the boat when life is fine just the way it
is7 In readings, this card often stands fOr convention-following established guidelines and
maintaining the status quo. Fat cats are rarely radicals; they love tradition and the tried-and­
true. Sometimes it is important to trust the known ways, but only when change is inadvisable.
The Ten of Pentacles is also concerned with permanen ce. Change is an unavoidable part
of life, but constant change is uncomfOrtable . We need stability and the chance to work fOr
a secure fOundation in life. In readings, this card may be telling you to concentrate on the long
term. Work toward a lasting solution. Now may be the time to settle down and make the
arrangements that will work fOr you far into the future.

Court Card Pairs

Compare the ranks and suits of the two cards to see what such a pair
might mean.
Description
On the positive side, the Knight of Pentacles is like a bulldog. Once he
bites down, you can be sure he won't let go. He's dogged in pursuit of
his goals. A hard worker, he has tremendous stamina and dedication.
Every job is always completed down to the last detail. He's careful and 267
prudent, never wasteful. He knows the facts and is immune to false promises. On the nega­
tive side, this Knight is a bit stodgy and dull. He's not known for his playful sense of humor.
Work always comes first. He tends to be inflexible and obsessive about little details. Stubborn
to a fault, he refuses to give in even when wrong, something he'll never admit. He doesn't like
change or risk and will always take the gloomiest view.
In readings, a Knight of Pentacles shows that his cautious style is involved in the situation
as an aspect of you, someone else, or the atmosphere in general. You need to ask yourself. "Is
this Knight's energy helping or hurting7"
If his style is evident, then balance is needed. Are you working too hard? Do you refuse
to listen to reason7 Do you have a perfectionist in your life7 Is the atmosphere around you
one of gloom and doom7 It may be time for a change.
If this Knight's energy is missing, a dose of prudence may be called for. Are you spending
too much? Maybe it's time to slow down. Do you give up too soon? Dig in and refuse to quit.
Is your work often careless, late, or incomplete? Next time resolve to work up a sweat and
get the job done. Let the Knight of Pentacles introduce you to his world of care and persisten ce.

## The Celtic Cross Spread

The Celtic Cross
Introduction
The Celtic Cross is probably the oldest and most popular pattern fOr reading the tarot. It has
survived so long because the layout of the cards is simple, but powerful. A strong energy has
built up around this spread due to its use by so many people over the years.
You can think of the Celtic Cross as divided into two
Celtic Cross Spread sections: the Circle/Cross (six cards) on the left, and the
Staff (fOur cards) on the right.
The Circle/Cross simulates the Celtic cross found
throughout Ireland. This cross has a circle linking the
fOur perpendicular spokes. The circle and cross symbol­
ize the joining of spirit and matter and the unity of all
events in time. (See the example cross on page 276.)
The feminine energy of the circular section works in
unison with the masculine energy of the Staff section.
These two parts of the Celtic Cross mirror the dual
Circle/Cross Staff nature of manifested reality-the polarities that abound
in the human psyche.
The Circle/Cross section is made up of two crosses-a central
one (two cards) nested within a larger cross (six cards). The smaller
cross represents the heart of the matter-what is most central to
you at the time of the reading. It is the hub around which the
wheel of your life is turning.
The larger cross consists of two lines that overlay the minicross.
The horizontal line shows time moving from your past on the left
into your future on the right. The vertical line is your awareness
moving from your unconscious on the bottom to your conscious
mind on the top. Together these six cards give you a snapshot of
your inner and outer environment at the time of a reading.
The cards of the Staff section comment on your life and lie out­
side of the immediate situation. Here, your Inner Guide helps you
understand what is shown in the Circle/Cross section. You receive
guidance about yourself and others, your life lessons, and your fu­D D

There are a number of versions of the Celtic Cross. The differ-V--+ D
ences are usually in Positions 3-4-5-6. I use a circular placement to
emphasize how the unconscious and the past (Cards 3 and 4) lead D D

This is the High Cross of Muredach.
(From Derek Bryce. Symbolism of the
Celtic Cross. York Beach. ME: Samuel
Weiser, 1995, p. 113.)
to the conscious and future (Cards 5 and 6). I have also added some meanings to Card 9. This
position traditionally means "hopes and fears," but I also use it as a lesson or guidance card.
It is always possible to adapt a spread to your own needs as long as you decide on any changes
before you do a reading.
Interpretation of the Celtic Cross
Here is one approach to interpreting the Celtic Cross.
1. Look at the six cards of the Circle/Cross section. They show what is going on in your
life at the moment of the reading.
### 2. Examine the cards in pairs, perhaps in the following order:

a. Look at Cards I and 2 to find out the central dynamic.
b. Look at Cards 3 and 5 to find out what is going on within you at different levels.
c. Look at Cards 4 and 6 to see how people and events are flowing through your life.
From these six cards, create a description of your immediate situation.
### 3. Consider the Staff section of the spread, perhaps in this order:

a. Look at Cards 7 and 8 to find out more about the relationship between you and
your environment.
The Celtic Cross 277
b. Look at Card l 0-the projected outcome. How do you feel about it? What does it
say to you7
4. Review the cards to discover the factors leading to the outcome. See if one card stands
out as key. Also:
a. Compare the projected outcome (Card 10) to a possible alternative outcome (Card 5).
b. Consider how the near future (Card 6) contributes to the projected outcome (Card I 0).
c. See if Card 9 tells you something you need to know. Do you have a hope or fear
that is relevant7

Jill's Readings
Introduction
Jill's tale is a series of three readings I did fOr a fi-iend over the course of a year. These read­
ings illustrate how the tarot can reflect developments over time. Every reading is a snapshot
of a given moment. As events unfOld, the snapshots change, but there is a common thread
that connects them. In this series about one woman's experience, you can see how new ele­
ments interact with those that endure. (Reversed cards were not used.)
In the interpretations, phrases in SMALL CAPITALS are meanings taken fi-om card infOrmation
pages. Italic phrases are taken fi-om position pages. I recommend laying out the cards selected
so you can experience these readings too.
Jill's First Reading
This first reading took place in January I 990 as an Open Reading fOr Jill (not her real name).
Jill had been adopted at eleven months. She wanted to learn all she could about her first year.
For several months, she had been trying to gain infOrmation about her birth mother and, to
a lesser extent, her birth father.
Jill tried to go through the agency that handled her adoption, but fOund that most of the
information was closed to her. At the time of the reading, she had decided to pursue legal
options to gain access. These are the cards she drew:
Celtic Cross with cards fi-om Jill's first reading.
]ill's Readings 289
When these cards were laid down, both of us were immediately drawn to the Three of
Swords-the root cause of the situation. This card perfectly symbolizes the HEARTBREAK and
LONELINESS Jill must have felt as a baby being abruptly separated from her birth parents and
foster family. Note the three swords-Jill and her two parents-piercing their communal
heart.
The BETRAYAL meaning is also important. At some level. .Jill feels betrayed by many people:
her adoptive parents who deny her search, the agency who thwarts it, and her birth parents
whom .Jill may unconsciously resent for leaving her.
The many court cards suggest a need for balance. First, there is the central Cups/Pentacles
pair (Cards I and 2). They symbolize the conflict between .Jill's wish to fantasize about the
future (Cups) and her need to be realistic (Pentacles). This theme will turn out to be a pri­
mary focus for .Jill in the months to come.
The Page of Pentacles shows Jill's need to fOcus on PRACTICAL matters in order to win her
legal case and learn about her origins. The Knight of Cups shows her countertendency to
dream UNREALIST ICALLY about what finding her birth mother will be like. He suggests that
Jill lacks moderation in her emotions. As a Knight, he shows that her hopes are OVERLY
## Romant Ic.

This idea is reinforced by the Queen of Cups as Card 4. The word "mother" popped into
my mind in relation to this card. It occurred to me that the Queen of Cups had a special
meaning in this case. She is the dream mother .Jill hopes to find; one who is completely LOV·
lNG and TENDER HEAIITED. This desire from the past is propelling Jill into her current situa­
tion.
Another important pair is the King of Swords as Card 7 and the Knight of Pentacles as
Card 8. The King of Swords suggests that .Jill sees herself as the agent of HONESTY and JUS·
TICE in this situation. She feels it is her right to learn the truth about her first year of life.
Also, in the week before the reading, .Jill had prepared a position paper for the court. She
used the talents of the King of Swords-his keen ANALYTICAL ABILITY, INTELLECT, and WRITING
## Skills.

The Knight of Pentacles suggests that other people may be seeing .Jill as TOO SERIOUS and
DRIVEN. Since they do not appreciate her intensity. they judge her as TOO OBSESSED to com­
promise. Whether or not this view is justified, it is valuable information. If .Jill alienates the
agency and the legal system, she reduces her chances for success. The Knight of Pentacles
hints that Jill should temper any appearance of INFLEXllliLITY with a moderated, reasonable
approach.
The Five of Cups as Card 9 is the key to the whole situation. It represents LOSS, beginning
with the original loss of her birth parents. Now, Jill must be willing to let go of her dream
mother so a true relationship can form with her actual birth mother, whoever she may be.
Jill is also afraid she may LOSE her court case.
The Eight of Swords suggests that some confusing moments lie ahead There will be times
when Jill feels POWERLESS as she tries to balance her conflicting feelings. Also, outside forces
may temporarily RESTRICT her search.
On the other hand, the Six of Wands as Card 5 and the Magician as Card I 0 could not
290 Leaming the Tarot
be more positive. The Six of Wands shows the strength of Jill's conscious belief in her ability
to overcome her legal obstacles and emerge TRIUMPHANT. She knows she can achieve the vic·
tory predicted by the Magician. As the only major arcana card in the reading, the Magician
shows the extra dimension of POWER waiting fur Jill when she realizes her goal. If she can
consolidate her inner strengths and accept her losses consciously. she will meet with great
success.
Jill's Second Reading
In June 1990, I did an Other Reading about Jill and her situation. The events which had tran­
spired were so dramatic that I felt drawn to see what the tarot would say about them.
In March, Jill met with a judge who was so convinced by the validity of her search that
she ruled the adoption files should be opened. Through hard work, Jill located her birth
parents within three weeks. Her father was reluctant to speak with her at first, but her
mother welcomed her warmly after a surprise meeting in a distant city.
I truly felt Jill had realized the positive outcome projected fur her in the first reading. She
trusted her abilities and accomplished all her goals in a very short time; however, this drama
was about to take an unexpected turn.
Jill and her birth mother quickly furmed a close relationship . While Jill was staying with
her mother, her birth father reestablished contact. Her parents spoke to each other fur the
first time in over thirty years, and soon they renewed their original romantic relationship! It
was at this time that I decided to do a reading. I wanted to understand the highly charged
energy that surrounded this situation. The question I wrote was, "What is the nature and
cause of the intertwining life dramas of Jill, her birth mother, and her birth father?" Here are
the cards I chose:
Celtic Cross with cards from Jill's second reading.
jill's Read;ngs 291
We again see a Page as Card I. Jill's situation is still an opportunity to act, but this time she
is facing a CHALLENGE. Jill must be TRUTHFUL with herself and approach this situation with
FORTITUDE and CLARITY OF THOUGHT (Swords).
The Four of Swords as Card 2 tells her how to support herself through this period. She
must EXAMINE HER ACTIONS AND MOTIVATIONS scrupulously. She must also NURTURE A STILL, QUIET
CENTER in herself so that she can ride this emotional roller coaster.
In Cards 3 and 5 we see the links between this reading and the first. In Card 5, we again
see the "dream mother"-the Queen of Cups. It seems that Jill has not let this ideal go, but
has instead placed it firmly in her conscious mind. She is thinking and feeling about her birth
mother most of the time.
In January. the Rve of Cups showed that transmuting emotional loss is a key lesson fOr Jill
in this drama. Now, this card has moved to Card 3. The regret Jill feels about her birth has
become lodged firmly in her unconscious. At a deep level, she is mourning the loss of her loved
ones and the dream of what might have been. This reenactment of her birth triangle is also
triggering a fear that she will LOSE her parents again.
The Three of Pentacles as Card 4 suggests that the TEAMWORK Jill has enjoyed with her
birth parents may become a thing of the past. The position of the figures on this card is re­
vealing. Two are together while the other stands alone. The solitary figure is half turned away
as if she can't decide if she is part of the twosome or not. In studying this card, I noticed for
the first time the tipped cup in the right hand of the lone figure. How clearly it echoes the
overturned cups in the Five of Cups and the losses they represent!
The Four of Wands as Card 6 is cause fOr CELEBRATION. Whatever else Jill's situation may
bring, it seems that the near future will be EXCITING.
Cards 7 and 8 carry extra weight because they are major arcana cards. They spell out an
important conflict between Jill and her environment. Jill's point of view is the Lovers. She
wants to fOrge the bonds of LOVE and RELATIONSHIP that were denied her originally. She is also
coming to terms with the fact that her parents are becoming lovers literally.
UnfOrtunately. Jill's environment is one of FEAR and ILWSION. The Moon symbolizes the
UNCERTAINTIE.'l that arise when events are not what they seem and people do not mean what
they say. In this case, there is no willful deceit, just lack of clarity. No one means any harm,
but everyone is unsure of their real needs.
It appears that Jill is heading toward some REJECTION as pictured in the Five of Pentacles
(Card I o>. The lack of unity showing up throughout this reading suggests that Jill could find
herself LEFT OUT IN THE COLD, SHUNNED as the odd person out.
Jill's strength lies with the TRUTH The Page of Swords (Card l) reminds her of the cen­
tral need for CLARITY and HONESTY. In the meantime, Jill should prepare for the worst. The
Nine of Wands as Card 9 tells her she must be DEFENSIVE and prepare to draw on her hidden
reserves. There may be CELEBRATION in the near future, but there will also be hard times as
.Jill seeks to find her way with truth in her new relationships.
Jill's Third Reading
The third reading fOr Jill was held in her presence in November 1990. In July. Jill's birth fa­
ther visited her mother, and the budding romance between the two blossomed. In August,
292 Learning the Tarot
Jill and her mother traveled to the distant state where her father lived. There were positive
aspects to the trip, but the visit took a troubling turn toward the end. Jill experienced the
rejection anticipated in the second reading when her father's door was literally slammed in
her face one night. She was turned out onto the street when the tensions between them
reached a climax.
Jill's mother never returned from that trip. She left her husband and all her belongings to
move in with Jill's father. From that point on, Jill's interaction with the two was often tense.
There were several dramatic, even frightening, occurrences that were very upsetting to Jill.
At the time of the reading, she wanted very much to find out where this situation was head­
ing. The question she wrote was: "How will my relationship with my birth mother and birth
father develop in the future?"
Here are the cards she drew:

Celtic Cross with cards from Jill's third reading.
We can see that the energies of Jill's situation are still in evidence. There are fuur repeat cards.
The Eight ofSwords has moved from Card 6 (reading l) to Card 3. The RE'>TRICTION that was
in the future is now the basis of the situation. The emotional events of the past year have been
so turbulent that Jill feels POWERLE'>S at a fundamental level.
The Nine of Wands has moved from Card 9 (reading 2) to Card 5. This card was a warn­
ing to Jill to take care of herself and PREPARE FOR THE WORST. Well, she has certainly started to
think along those lines! Having been burned, she knows she has to be strong and DEFENSIVE
emotionally.
jill's Readings 293
The Four of Wands has moved from Card 6 (reading 2) to Card 4. The CELEBRATION over
the reunion is fading. The excitement of the good times has moved through Jill's life and is
now way behind her.
Cards 7 and 8 show that Jill's expectations still do not match her parents~ Jill longs for a
SECURE, ORDERLY family life (Ten of Pentacles). She wants a solution that will ENDURE-nothing
more than the chance to experience the ORDINARY ROUTINES of a normal family.
Her parents, however, are locked into an OBSESSIVE RELATIONSHIP symbolized by the Devil.
What Jill viewed as the Lovers in reading 2 is really the BONDAGE of two souls who do not
have enough self-understanding to create a love that includes their daughter.
Jill needs a resolution, and there are two cards that suggest it is coming. First is the Eight
of Wands as Card I. This card shows that a CONCIJJSION is likely. Jill will be able to COMPLETE
UNFINISHED BUSINESS if she takes QUICK, DECISIVE ACTION.
Death shows that a major ENDING is approaching in the near future. Perhaps the three will
suffer a PARTING OF THE WAYS. Maybe Jill will make a TRANSITION into a new kind of relation­
ship with her parents.
The Empress as the outcome or resolution is a positive sign because it shows that the ideal
of the Mother is the understanding awaiting Jill in this situation. The Empress is the arche­
type of MOTHERING-the ability to love, cherish, and nurture despite all temptations away from
that response. Jill felt this card also meant a refOcusing on her own role as a mother.
How is Jill to proceed if she wants to bring about this positive resolution? The key lies in
the two Pentacles court cards. The Page as Card 9 is the fOurth repeat card; it appeared first
as Card I (reading I). It reinforces the idea that Jill's lesson is about TRUST and the ABILITY TO
## Act On Your Dreams.

Jill fuund her birth parents despite many fOrmidable obstacles, but she discovered that the
reality was not the same as her fantasy. She learned to trust herself and not rely on the sup­
port of others to see her through. The King of Pentacles as Card 2 tells Jill not to seek salva­
tion through other people. She must develop within herself the mature (kingly) Pentacles
qualities'of STEADINESS AND DEPENDABILITY.
The Page is encouraging her to claim her power and FIND A SOLUTION THAT WORKS. She must
release her dream of an ideal family once and fur all so she can relate to her actual parents
with all their faults and limitations.
Although this reading is about love and the ties that bind people from birth, there is not
a single Cups card. These cards oflove and emotion are totally absent. The lessons oflove are
not always easy. For Jill, they have taken the furm of challenges that have drawn out her in­
ner reserves and made her a stronger and wiser person.
## Appendices

## Appendix A

The Fool's Journey
The Fool's Journey is a metaphor fur the journey through life. Each major arcana card stands
fur a stage on that journey-an experience that a person must incorporate to realize his
wholeness . These 22 descriptions are based on the keywords fur each major arcana card. The
keywords appear as SMALL CAPITAL~ in the text. A card's number is in parentheses .
The Fool
We begin with the Fool (0), a card of HEGINNING S. The Fool stands fur each of us as we begin
our journey of life. He is a fOol because only a simple soul has the innocent FAITH to under­
take such a journey with all its hazards and pain.
At the start of his trip, the Fool is newborn-fresh, open, and SPONTANEOUS. The figure on
Card 0 has his arms flung wide, and his head held high. He is ready to embrace whatever
comes his way. but he is also oblivious to the cliff edge he is about to cross. The Fool is un­
aware of the hardships he will face as he ventures out to le~rn the lessons of the world.
The Fool stands somewhat outside the rest of the major arcana. Zero is an unusual num­
ber. It rests in the exact middle of the number system-poised between the positive and
negative. At birth, the Fool is set in the middle of his own individual universe. He is strangely
empty (as is zero), but imbued with a desire to go fOrth and learn. This undertaking would
seem to be FOLLY, but is it?
Magician and the High Priestess
On setting out, the Fool immediately encounters the Magician (I) and the High Priestess
(2)-the great balancing furces that make up the perceived world. It is a feature of the mate­
rial universe that as soon as we name some aspect of experience, we automaticall y evoke its
opposite.
The Magician is the positive side. He represents the ACTIVE, masculine power of creative
impulse. He is also CONSCIOUS AWARENESS. The Magician is the furce that allows us to impact
the world through a CONCENTRATION of individual will and POWER. The High Priestess is the
negative side. She is the MYSTERIOUS UNCONSCIOUS. She provides the fertile ground in which
creative events occur. The High Priestess is our unrealized POTENTIAL waiting fur an active
principle to bring it to expression .
The words positive and negative do not imply "good" and "bad." These are human distinc­
tions that do not apply in the tarot. The Magician and the High Priestess are absolutely equal
in value and importance . Each is necessary fur balance. We may view the negative as our
Shadow, but without shadows, we cannot see the light, and without a ground of potential,
we cannot create.
298 Appendix A
The Empress
As he grows, the Fool becomes more and more aware of his surroundings. As with most
babies, he first recognizes his MOTHER-the warm, loving woman who nourishes and cares fOr
him. He also comes to know Mother Earth, who nurtures him in a larger sense.
The Empress (3) represents the world of NATURE and SENSATION. A baby delights in explor­
ing everything he touches, tastes, and smells. He cannot get enough of the sights and sounds
that enchant his senses. It is natural to delight in the ABUNDANT goodness of Mother Earth
who surrounds us with her support.
The Emperor
The next person the Fool encounters is the FATHER in the figure of the Emperor (4 ). He is the
representative of STRUCTURE and AUTHOR ITY. When a baby leaves his mother's arms, he learns
that there are patterns to his world. Objects respond in predictable ways that can be explored.
The child experiences a new kind of pleasure that comes from discovering order.
The Fool also encounters RULES. He learns his will is not always paramount, and there are
certain behaviors necessary fOr his well-being. There are people in authority who will enfOrce
such guidelines. These restrictions can be frustrating, but through the patient direction of the
Father, the Fool begins to understand their purpose.
The Hierophant
Eventually. the Fool ventures out of his home into the wider world. He is exposed to the
beliefS and traditions of his culture and begins his fOrmal EDUCATION. The Hierophant (5) rep­
resents the organized BELIEF SYSTEMS that begin to surround and infOrm the growing child.
A Hierophant is someone who interprets arcane knowledge and mysteries . On Card 5 we
see a religious figure blessing two acolytes. Perhaps he is inducting them into church mem­
bership. Although this image is religious, it is really a symbol fOr initiations of all kinds.
The child is trained in the practices of his society and becomes part of a particular culture
and world view. He learns to identifY with a GROUP and discovers a sense of belonging . He
enjoys learning the customs of his society and showing how well he can CONFORM to them.
The lovers
Eventually. the Fool faces two new challenges . He experiences the powerful urge fOr SEXUAL
union with another person. BefOre, he was mainly self-centered. Now he feels the balancing
tendency. pictured in the Lovers (6), to reach out and become half of a loving partnership .
He yearns for relationship.
The Fool also needs to decide upon his OWN BELIEFS. It is well enough to confOrm while
he learns and grows, but at some point, he must determine his own VAWES if he is to be true
to himself He must start to question received opinion.
The Chariot
By the time the Fool becomes an adult, he has a strong identity and a certain mastery over
himself Through discipline and WILLPOWER, he has developed an inner control which allows
him to triumph over his environment.
The Chariot (7) represents the vigorous ego that is the Fool's crowning achievement so far.
The Fool's Journey 299
On Card 7, we see a proud, commanding figure riding VICTORIOUSLY through his world. He is
in VISIBLE CONTROL of himself and all he surveys. For the moment, the Fool's ASSERTIVE success
is all he might wish, and he feels a certain selfsatisfaction . His is the assured confidence of
youth.
Strength
Over time, life presents the Fool with new challenges, some that cause suffering and disillu­
sionment. He has many occasions to draw on the quality of STRENGTH (8). He is pressed to
develop his courage and resolve and find the heart to keep going despite setbacks.
The Fool also discovers the quiet attributes of PATIENCE and TOLERANCE. He realizes the
willful command of the Chariot must be tempered by kindliness and the SOFTER POWER of a
loving approach . At times, intense passions surface, just when the the Fool thought he had
everything , including himself, under control.
Hermit
Sooner or later, the Fool is led to ask himself the age-old question "Why?" He becomes ab­
sorbed with the SEARCH for answers, not from an idle curiosity. but out of a deeply felt need
to find out why people live, if only to suffer and die. The Hermit (9) represents the need to
find deeper truth.
The Fool begins to LOOK INWARD, trying to understand his feelings and motivations. The
sensual world holds less attraction for him, and he seeks moments of SOLITUDE away from the
frantic activity of society. In time he may seek a teacher or GUIDE who can give him advice
and direction.
Wheel of Fortune
Alter much soul-searching, the Fool begins to see how everything connects. He has a VISION
of the world's wondrous design; its intricate patterns and cycles. The Wheel of Fortune 0 0)
is a symbol of the mysterious universe whose parts work together in harmony. When the
Fool glimpses the beauty and order of the world, if only briefly. he finds some of the answers
he is seeking.
Sometimes his experiences seem to be the work of fate. A chance encounter or miracu­
lous occurren ce begins the process of change. The Fool may recognize his DESTINY in the
sequence of events that led him to this TURNING POINT. Having been solitary. he feels ready for
MOVEMENT and action again. His perspective is wider, and he sees himself within the grander
scheme of a universal plan. His sense of purpose is restored.
Justice
The Fool must now decide what this vision means to him personally. He looks back over his
life to trace the CAUSE AND EFFECT relationships that brought him to this point. He takes RE­
SPONSIBILITY for his past actions so he can make amends and ensure a more honest course for
the future. The demands of JUSTICE (ll) must be served so he can wipe the slate clean.
This is a time of DECISION far the Fool. He is making important choices. Will he remain true
to his insights, or slip back into an easier, more unaware existence that closes off further
growth?
300 Appendix A
Hanged Man
Undaunted, the Fool pushes on. He is determined to realize his vision, but he finds life is not
so easily tamed. Sooner or later, he encounters his personal cross-an experience that seems
too difficult to endure. This overwhelming challenge humbles him until he has no choice but
to give up and LET GO.
At first, the Fool feels defeated and lost. He believes he has SACRIFICED everything, but from
the depths he learns an amazing truth. He finds that when he relinquishes his struggle fur
control, everything begins to work as it should. By becoming open and vulnerable, the Fool
discovers the miraculous support of his Inner Self He learns to surrender to his experiences,
rather than fighting them. He feels a surprising joy and begins to flow with life.
The Fool feels SUSPENDED in a timeless moment, free of urgency and pressure. In truth, his
world has been TURNED UPSIDE-DOWN. The Fool is the Hanged Man (12), apparently martyred,
but actually serene and at peace.
Death
The Fool now begins to ELIMINATE old habits and tired approaches. He cuts out nonessentials
because he appreciates the basics of life. He goes through ENDINGS as he puts the outgrown
aspects of his life behind him. This process may seem like dying because it is the death of his
familiar self to allow for the growth of a new one. At times this INEXORABLE CHANGE seems to
be crushing the Fool, but eventually he rises up to discover that Death 03) is not a perma­
nent state. It is simply a TRANSITION to a new, more fulfilling way of life.
Temperance
Since embracing the Hermit, the Fool has swung wildly back and fOrth on an emotional pen­
dulum. Now, he realizes the BALANCING stability of TEMPERANCE 04). He discovers true poise
and equilibrium. By experiencing the extremes, he has come to appreciate moderation . The
Fool has COMBINED all aspects of himself into a centered whole that glows with HEALTH and well­
being. How graceful and soft is the angel on Card I 4 compared to the powerful but rigid ruler
on the Chariot (Card 7)71 The Fool has come a long way in realizing the harmonious life.
Devil
The Fool has his health, peace of mind, and a graceful composure. What more could he need?
On everyday terms, not much, but the Fool is courageous and continues to pursue the deep­
est levels of his being. He soon comes face to face with the Devil 05).
The Devil is not an evil, sinister figure residing outside of us. He is the knot of IGNORAN CE
and HOPELESSNESS lodged within each of us at some level. The seductive attractions of the
MATERIAL world bind us so compellingly that we often do not even realize our slavery to them.
We live in a limited range of experience, unaware of the glorious world that is our true
heritage. The couple on Card 15 are chained, but acquiescent. They could so easily free them­
selves, but they do not even apprehend their BONDAGE. 2 They look like the Lovers, but are

The Fool's Journey 301
unaware that their love is circumscribed within a narrow range. The price of this ignorance
is an inner core of despair.
Tower
How can the Fool free himself from the Devil? Can he ever root out his influence? The Fool
may only find RELEASE through the SUDDEN CHANGE represented by the Tower (16). The Tower
is the ego fOrtress each of us has built around his beautiful inner core. Gray, cold, and rock­
hard, this fOrtress seems to protect but is really a prison.
Sometimes only a monumental crisis can generate enough power to smash the walls of the
Tower. On Card 16 we see an enlightening bolt striking this building. It has ejected the oc­
cupants who seem to be TUMBLING to their deaths. The crown indicates they were once proud
rulers; now they are humbled by a furce stronger than they.
The Fool may need such a severe shakeup if he is to free himself. but the resulting REV·
ELATION makes the painful experience worthwhile. The dark despair is blasted away in an in­
stant, and the light of truth is free to shine down.
Star
The Fool is suffused with a SERENE calm. The beautiful images on the Star ( 17) attest to this
tranquility. The woman pictured on Card 1 7 is naked, her soul no longer hidden behind any
disguise. Radiant stars shine in a cloudless sky serving as a beacon of HOPE and INSPIRATION .
The Fool is blessed with a trust that completely replaces the negative energies of the Devil.
His fuith in himself and the future is restored. He is filled with joy and his one wish is to share
it GENEROUSLY with the rest of the world. His heart is open and his love pours out freely. This
peace after the storm is a magical moment fur the Fool.
Moon
What effect could spoil this perfect calm? Is there another challenge fur the Fool? In fuct, it
is his bliss that makes him vulnerable to the ILLUSIONS of the Moon (18). The Fool's joy is a
feeling state. His positive emotions are not subject to mental clarity. In his dreamy condition,
the Fool is susceptible to fantasy, distortion, and a fulse picture of the truth.
The Moon stimulates the creative IMAGINATION. It opens the way fur bizarre and beautiful
thoughts to bubble up from the unconscious , but deep-seated FEARS and anxieties also arise.
These experiences may cause the Fool to feel lost and BEWILDERED .
Sun
It is the lucid clarity of the Sun 09) that directs the Fool's imagination. The Sun's illumina­
tion shines in all the hidden places. It dispels the clouds of confusion and fear. It ENLIGHTENS,
so the Fool both feels and understands the goodness of the world.
Now, he enjoys a vibrant energy and enthusiasm. The Star's openness has solidified into
an expansive ASSURANCE The Fool is the naked babe pictured on Card 19, riding out joyously
to fuce a new day. No challenge is too daunting. The Fool feels a radiant VITALITY. He becomes
involved in grand undertakings as he draws to himself everything he needs. He is able to re­
alize his GREATNESS.
302 Appendix A
Judgement
The Fool has been REBORN. His false ego-self has been shed, allowing his radiant, true self to
manifest. He has discovered that joy, not fear, is at life's center.
The Fool feels ABSOLVED. He fOrgives himself and others, knowing that his real self is pure
and good. He may regret past mistakes, but he knows they were due to his ignorance of his
nature. He feels cleansed and refreshed, ready to start anew.
It is time fOr the Fool to make a deeper JUDGMENT (20) about his life. His own personal
day of reckoning has arrived. Since he now sees himself truly, he can make the necessary de­
cisions about the future. He can choose wisely which values to cherish, and which to discard.
The angel on Card 20 is the Fool's Higher Self CALLING him to rise up and fulfill his prom­
ise. He discovers his true vocation-his reason fOr entering this life. Doubts and hesitations
vanish, and he is ready to fOllow his dream.
World
The Fool reenters the World (21 ), but this time with a more complete understanding . He
has INTEGRATED all the disparate parts of himself and achieved wholeness. He has reached a
new level of happiness and FULFILLMENT.
The Fool experiences life as full and meaningful. The future is filled with infinite promise.
In line with his personal calling, he becomes actively INVOLVED in the world. He renders
service by sharing his unique gifts and talents and finds that he prospers at whatever he
attempts. Because he acts from inner certainty, the. whole world conspires to see that his ef­
fOrts are rewarded . His ACCOMPLISHMENTS are many.
• • •
So the Fool's Journey was not so fOolish after all. Through perseverance and honesty, he re­
established the spontaneous courage that first impelled him on his search fOr Self, but now
he is fully aware of his place in the world. This cycle is over, but the Fool will never stop grow­
ing. Soon he will be ready to begin a new journey that will lead him to ever greater levels of
understanding.

Tarot Suit Qualities
Each of the four suits in the tarot has its own special quality or energy. You can get a feel for
these energies by looking over the word lists in this appendix. Each list has words that show
the difkrent facets of a suit's character. These words are just my suggestions. If your intuition
guides you difkrently, trust your own impressions first.
There is a positive and negative list for each suit. This split is not ideal because it implies
good and bad. In the tarot, qualities are neither good nor bad, they just are. We humans judge
qualities based on their impact on us. Our language reflects these judgments, so we have
positive and negative expressions for every quality. We also view traits difkrentl y depending
on our circumstances. Is being aggressive positive or negative7 It all depends.

Shuffling Methods
Card Player's Method
The Card Player's Method is commonly used to shuffle everyday playing cards. Hold about
half the cards face down in each hand and intermingle them as they drop to the surface of
the table. This technique mixes the cards thoroughly, but it can be awkward because most
tarot cards are bigger than normal. This method is also hard on your cards. They tend to furm
a bend in the middle. The Card Player's Method is effi.ctive, but somewhat mechanical in
spirit.
Insertion Method
Hold about half the deck in each hand, and insert one half in a scattered fashion down
through the other half You can hold the cards on their long or short side. This method is
fast, efficient, and composed with a lot of hand-to-card contact. Be careful with the edges as
they can fray ave~ time.
Cowie Push/Put Method
I discovered this style in a book by Norma Cowie.' Her technique thoroughly mixes the cards
with maximum hand contact and little or no damage. Hold the deck face down in your domi­
nant hand. Push some cards from the top with your thumb into your other hand. Then, push
again, but this time to the bottom of the new pile. Continue alternating a push to the top, then
one to the bottom until all the cards have been transferred . At this point, put the entire deck
back into your dominant hand and start over. This method can be difficult at first. You may
push too many at a time or drop some, but your technique will improve with practice.
Scrambling Method
The Scrambling Method is about as basic as you can get. Spread all the cards face down on
the floor or table, and start scrambling . This technique creates a good mix with few ill effi.cts
on the cards. The main drawback is that you need room. This shuffle also has a rather
uncomposed feel which some find objectionable.
To Avoid Reversed Cards
Start with your cards all facing the same direction. Every time you divide the deck befOre
shuffiing, make sure the two piles stay facing the same way.
To (jet Reversed Cards
Every time you divide the deck befOre shuffling, rotate one of the piles 180 degrees.
