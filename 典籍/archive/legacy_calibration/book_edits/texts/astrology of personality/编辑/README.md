## Rudhyar's Humanistic Approach

**Core Distinctions**:

| Traditional Astrology | Rudhyar's Humanistic Astrology |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Fortune-telling | Self-actualization |
| Event prediction | Psychological growth |
| Static traits | Dynamic becoming |
| Determinism | Free will + potential |
| Fragmented factors | Integrated wholeness |
| Materialistic | Spiritual/transpersonal |

**Philosophical Foundation**:
- **Jung**: Individuation, wholeness, archetypal patterns
- **Theosophy**: Spiritual evolution, cycles of consciousness
- **Holism**: Chart as organic whole (not sum of parts)
- **Process**: Life as becoming (not static being)

---

## Core Concepts to Extract

**Humanistic Principles** (7-10):
1. Person-centered astrology (vs event-prediction)
2. Wholeness principle (integrated chart interpretation)
3. Cycles of becoming (developmental astrology)
4. Individuation process (Jung integration)
5. Transpersonal consciousness
6. Creative transformation
7. Seed-potential (chart as blueprint, not fate)

**Key Concepts** (10-13):
8. Cyclocosm (rhythmic universe)
9. Planetary function (not influence)
10. Sign as field of experience (not traits)
11. House as life arena (organic sectors)
12. Aspect as dynamic relationship
13. Chart as mandala (wholeness symbol)

## East-West Integration

**Rudhyar's Transpersonal ↔ Eastern Philosophy**:
- **Wholeness** ↔ 整体观/天人合一
- **Cycles of becoming** ↔ 轮回/生命周期
- **Individuation** ↔ 修行/证悟
- **Transpersonal consciousness** ↔ 超个人意识/天人合一
- **Seed-potential** ↔ 命格/先天禀赋（非宿命）
- **Mandala chart** ↔ 曼陀罗/太极图（完整性象征）

**Philosophical Parallels**:
- Rudhyar's holism = Daoist 道/整体观
- Cyclic development = Buddhist 生死轮回/成长历程
- Creative transformation = 易经 变易/生生不息
