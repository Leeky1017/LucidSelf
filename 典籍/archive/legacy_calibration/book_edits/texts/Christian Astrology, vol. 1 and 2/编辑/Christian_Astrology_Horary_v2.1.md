## PART 1: Foundational Horary Concepts

### 1. Horary Astrology - Question-Answering System

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Source Text

"Horary Questions are such Doubts and Queries whereof men and women require resolution, which being propounded to the Astrologian, he shall, by Erecting a Figure upon that Question or Querie propounded, give a true and rationall Answer to the Propoundor. The Chart of Heaven must be framed exactly for the houre and minute of the time wherein the Question is propounded; for as wel in the very time of receiving the Question, as in the Radicall intention of him that asks, does the success or not success of the thing demanded depend."

#### Key Term Analysis

- **Horary (from Latin hora)**: "Of the hour"—astrology based on the exact moment a question is understood, not birth
- **Propounded/Propoundor**: Lilly's terms for question being asked and person asking; formal 17th-century legal language
- **Radicall Intention**: The genuine, sincere concern behind a question; "radical" = from root, essential
- **Figure**: The horoscope chart; "erecting a figure" = casting a chart for specific moment

#### English Paraphrase (Primary Language)

**Horary Astrology** (from Latin "hora" = hour) is the branch of astrology answering **specific questions** by casting a chart for the **exact moment** the astrologer comprehends the question. Unlike natal astrology examining lifelong character, horary delivers **one question, one chart, one answer**—focused predictions about specific outcomes.

**The core principle**: The heavens at the moment of inquiry **mirror the nature and outcome** of the matter questioned. This is **synchronicity** (Jung's term, though Lilly predates it)—meaningful coincidence between inner concern and outer celestial pattern.

**How it works**:
1. **Question formulated**: Querent (questioner) has specific, sincere concern
2. **Chart cast**: For moment astrologer understands question (not when querent first thought it)
3. **Significators assigned**: Planets representing querent and quesited (thing asked about)
4. **Judgment rendered**: Based on planetary relationships, aspects, houses, dignity
5. **Answer delivered**: Yes/no, timing, advice on action

**Question types** Lilly addresses:
- **7th house**: Will marriage occur? Is partner faithful? Success of lawsuit?
- **2nd house**: Will I recover debt? Find treasure? Gain wealth?
- **10th house**: Will I get job? Achieve honor? Succeed in career?
- **4th house**: Should I buy property? Where is hidden thing? Father's condition?
- **Lost objects**: Which house contains thing, timing of recovery

**Timing principles**:
- **Degrees to aspect**: Each degree = time unit (context determines if days, weeks, months)
- **Planetary speed**: Fast planet (Moon, Mercury) = quick; slow planet (Saturn) = delayed
- **Sign type**: Cardinal = fast, Fixed = slow, Mutable = moderate
- **Retrograde**: Delays, reversals, things coming back

**Distinction from natal astrology**:
- **Natal**: "Who am I?" (character, lifelong themes)
- **Horary**: "Will X happen?" (specific outcome, timing)
- **Chart moment**: Birth vs question understood
- **Scope**: Entire life vs one matter
- **Method**: Psychological analysis vs concrete prediction

**East-West parallel**: Horary closely parallels Chinese **六爻** (liuyao, six-line divination)—both answer specific questions using moment-based symbolic system, both use houses/lines for life areas, both predict timing.

#### Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)

**卜卦占星**(Horary Astrology，源自拉丁语"hora"=小时)是占星学分支，通过为占星师理解问题的**精确时刻**起盘回答**具体问题**。不同于本命盘占星检查终生性格，卜卦提供**一个问题、一张盘、一个答案**——关于特定结果的聚焦预测。

**核心原则**：提问时刻的天象**镜像所询之事的性质和结果**。这是**同步性**(Jung术语，虽然Lilly早于它)——内在关切与外在天体模式之间有意义的巧合。

**如何运作**：(1)**问题成形**：问者有具体、真诚的关切；(2)**起盘**：为占星师理解问题的时刻(非问者首次想到时)；(3)**征象星分配**：代表问者和所问之事的行星；(4)**判断作出**：基于行星关系、相位、宫位、尊贵；(5)**答案交付**：是/否、时间、行动建议。

**问题类型** Lilly处理：第7宫(婚姻发生？伴侣忠诚？诉讼成功？)；第2宫(收回债务？找到宝藏？获得财富？)；第10宫(得到工作？获得荣誉？事业成功？)；第4宫(应买房产？隐藏物在哪？父亲状况？)；遗失物品(在哪宫、何时找回)。

**时间原则**：到相位的度数(每度=时间单位，语境决定是日/周/月)；行星速度(快行星如月亮/水星=快速；慢行星如土星=延迟)；星座类型(基本=快，固定=慢，变动=中等)；逆行(延迟、逆转、事情回来)。

**与本命占星区别**：本命盘"我是谁？"(性格、终生主题) vs 卜卦"X会发生吗？"(特定结果、时间)；盘的时刻：出生 vs 问题理解；范围：整个生命 vs 一个事项；方法：心理分析 vs 具体预测。

**东西对照**：卜卦占星密切对应中国**六爻**——两者都通过基于时刻的象征系统回答具体问题，都用宫位/爻位代表生活领域，都预测时间。

#### Core Points

- **Moment-based**: Chart cast for exact time astrologer understands question
- **Specific questions**: One question, one answer, concrete prediction
- **Synchronicity**: Heaven mirrors querent's situation at inquiry moment
- **Significators**: Planets represent querent and thing asked about
- **Judgment method**: Aspect relationships + house + dignity = answer
- **Timing prediction**: Degrees, planetary speed, sign type determine when
- **East-West parallel**: Similar to 六爻 (liuyao) question-focused divination

#### Detailed Explanation

William Lilly's "Christian Astrology" (1659) is the **foundational English text** on horary practice, still used by modern practitioners. Unlike earlier texts emphasizing theory, Lilly provides **systematic methodology** applicable to real questions.

**Historical context**: 17th century England, astrology at peak of respectability. Lilly consulted by nobility, clergy, common folk. His hundreds of documented case studies demonstrate method's applicability. "Christian" in title = acceptable to church (claimed divine sanction for astrological knowledge).

**Why it works** (Lilly's view): God created cosmos as unified whole. Celestial patterns aren't causes but **signs** (like smoke indicates fire). When person formulates genuine question, their concern "ripens" at moment astrologer receives it—that moment's chart symbolically encodes answer.

**Modern psychological view**: Horary chart externalizes querent's unconscious knowledge. Through symbolic system, intuition becomes conscious. Similar to Tarot—random-seeming selection actually reflects inner state.

**Question radicality** (readability): Some questions can't be read:
- **Early Ascendant** (<3°): Question premature, situation unformed
- **Late Ascendant** (>27°): Question too late, outcome already decided
- **Saturn/Mars on angles**: Heavy obstruction or violence
- **Via Combusta** (15° Libra - 15° Scorpio): Combusted zone, unclear judgment
- **Moon void of course**: No outcome, matter dissolves

**Ethical considerations**: Lilly insists on **sincere questions**. Testing astrologer produces unreadable charts. Questions about divine matters (salvation, prayer efficacy) deemed inappropriate—astrology for worldly concerns only.

**Practical application today**: Modern horary astrologers use Lilly's methods largely unchanged. Some additions: outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) as rulers of modern concerns, computer chart calculation. Core principles remain: significators, aspects, houses, dignity, timing.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Lilly's "Christian Astrology" (1647/1659) is the first comprehensive English horary text, superseding Latin manuscripts. The title "Christian" was strategic—distancing from occultism during Puritan era. Lilly preserves Arabic-period techniques (via Bonatti, Guido) while adapting to English Protestant context. Modern Traditional Revival (since 1980s) returned to Lilly as authoritative source, often preferring him over later simplifications.
- **中文**: Lilly的《基督教占星学》(1647/1659)是第一部全面的英语占星学文本，取代了拉丁手稿。"基督教"标题是策略性的——在清教徒时代与神秘主义保持距离。Lilly保留了阿拉伯时期技术（通过Bonatti、Guido），同时适应英国新教语境。现代传统复兴（1980年代起）回归Lilly作为权威来源，常偏好他而非后来的简化版本。

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Horary astrology as moment-based question-answering system using celestial-situational synchronicity

- **Natural Attributes**:
  - **Symbolism**: Heaven-as-mirror, moment-chart coincidence, cosmic clock, symbolic map
  - **Characteristics**: Specific (one question), moment-based (exact time), predictive (outcome-focused), binary (yes/no)
  - **Elements**: Significators, houses, aspects, motion, dignity, timing, radicality

- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - **Mapping function**: Question → houses, people → planets, process → aspects
  - **Prediction function**: Applying aspects = yes/completion, separating = no/past
  - **Timing function**: Degrees to perfection = time units
  - **Judgment function**: Planetary relationship + context = answer

- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**:
    - Question sincere, specific, important to querent
    - Chart radical (readable: proper Ascendant degree, Moon not void)
    - Astrologer understands question before casting
  - **Enhancing Conditions**:
    - Clear significators (unambiguous planet assignments)
    - Strong reception (mutual dignity between significators)
    - Applying aspects (planets moving toward perfection)
  - **Nullifying Conditions**:
    - Question insincere or testing astrologer
    - Chart unreadical (early/late Ascendant, afflicted angles)
    - No connection between significators (matter won't manifest)

- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - **Literal Layer**: Planets at X degrees, Y signs, Z aspects at moment T
  - **Symbolic Layer**: Each position = symbolic actor in querent's drama
  - **Practical Layer**: Aspects + houses reveal concrete yes/no and timing
  - **Psychological Layer**: Chart externalizes querent's unconscious knowledge
  - **Philosophical Layer**: Synchronicity, cosmos as unified semiotic system

### 2. Significators - Representative Planets

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Source Text

"The Significator of him or her that propounds the Question, is always the Lord of the houre wherein the Question is asked, viz. the Lord of the Ascendent; and therefore you must erect your Figure exactly for that time wherein you perfectly understood the Question. The Moon is generally a co-Significator with the Lord of the Ascendent, and in every Question may be so used. The Significator of the thing demanded, is the Lord of that House which signifies the thing demanded."

#### Key Term Analysis

- **Lord of the Ascendent**: The planet ruling the sign on the 1st house cusp; traditional rulerships only (Mars for Scorpio, not Pluto)
- **Co-Significator**: Secondary planet sharing signification; Moon always co-signifies querent alongside Ascendant ruler
- **Thing Demanded**: The quesited—whatever matter the querent asks about (marriage, money, job, etc.)
- **Lord of that House**: The planet ruling the sign on the cusp of the relevant house (e.g., 7th for marriage)

#### English Paraphrase (Primary Language)

**Significators** are the planets assigned to represent the **main actors or elements** in the question. Proper significator assignment is **foundation of judgment**—if you misidentify significators, entire reading collapses.

**The two essential significators**:

**1. Querent (问卜者)** - The Questioner:
- **Primary**: Ruler of Ascendant (1st house cusp sign's traditional ruler)
  - Example: Ascendant in Leo → Sun represents querent
  - Example: Ascendant in Scorpio → Mars represents querent (traditional, not Pluto)
- **Secondary**: Moon (universal co-significator)
  - Moon shows querent's emotional state, changeability, immediate concerns
  - When querent's ruler badly placed, Moon often provides backup testimony

**2. Quesited (被询之物)** - Thing Asked About:
- **Determined by house**: Ruler of house governing questioned matter
  - 7th house (partners, lawsuits, enemies) → 7th house ruler
  - 2nd house (money, possessions, debt) → 2nd house ruler
  - 10th house (career, reputation, authority) → 10th house ruler
  - 4th house (property, father, endings) → 4th house ruler

**Additional significators**:
- **Natural rulers**: Some planets inherently signify certain things:
  - **Venus**: Women (traditional), beauty, pleasure, marriage
  - **Mars**: Men (traditional), conflict, speed, violence
  - **Mercury**: Communication, young people, thieves, merchants
  - **Jupiter**: Wealth, judges, clergy, expansion
  - **Saturn**: Elderly, land, agriculture, delays, death
  - **Sun**: Authority figures, kings, fathers, vitality
  - **Moon**: Mothers, common people, fluctuation, women

**Judgment principle**: **Relationship between querent's significator and quesited's significator determines outcome**.

**Aspect types**:
- **Applying** (入相位): Planets moving toward exact aspect → YES, matter perfects
- **Separating** (出相位): Planets moving apart after aspect → NO, opportunity past
- **No aspect**: Matter unlikely unless **translated by third planet** or **collection of light**

**Reception** (接纳): When one planet in dignity of another:
- **Mutual reception**: Both planets in each other's dignity → strong connection, matter succeeds despite obstacles
- **Single reception**: Quesited receives querent → they welcome you
- **No reception**: Indifference or rejection

**Example**: "Will I marry John?"
- Querent: Ascendant ruler (represents you)
- Quesited: 7th house ruler (represents John/marriage)
- If querent's ruler applies to 7th ruler by trine with mutual reception → YES, marriage likely
- If querent's ruler separates from 7th ruler → NO, relationship already cooling
- If no aspect but Moon translates light between them → Maybe, through intermediary

#### Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)

**征象星**(Significators)是指派代表问题主要行动者的行星。**问卜者**由上升守护星代表(+月亮作为共同征象星)。**被询之物**(quesited)由相关宫位守护星代表——第7宫守护星=伴侣/对手，第2宫守护星=金钱/财产，第10宫守护星=工作/荣誉，依此类推。**自然守护星**：某些行星固有地象征特定事物——金星(女性、美、婚姻)，火星(男性、冲突、速度)，水星(沟通、年轻人、商人)，木星(财富、法官、神职)，土星(老年、土地、延迟、死亡)，太阳(权威人物、父亲)，月亮(母亲、平民、波动)。**判断原则**：**问卜者征象星与被询之物征象星之间的关系决定结果**。相位类型：**入相**(applying，行星向精确相位移动)→是，事项完成；**出相**(separating，行星在相位后分离)→否，机会已过；**无相位**：事项不太可能，除非**第三行星传递**或**汇光**。

#### Core Points

- **Querent significator**: Ascendant ruler (primary) + Moon (secondary)
- **Quesited significator**: Ruler of house governing questioned matter
- **Natural rulers**: Planets inherently signifying certain things (Venus=women, Mars=men, etc.)
- **Applying aspect**: Significators moving toward each other = YES/completion
- **Separating aspect**: Significators moving apart = NO/past opportunity
- **Reception**: Planet in another's dignity = welcome, connection strength
- **No aspect**: Matter unlikely without translation or collection of light

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Lilly's significator system derives from Arabic sources (esp. Masha'allah, Sahl ibn Bishr) via medieval Latin translations. The "Lord of the Hour" mentioned in source was originally a separate technique (planetary hours) but Lilly prioritizes Ascendant ruler. Traditional rulerships are essential—modern outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) are debated among contemporary horary practitioners.
- **中文**: Lilly的征象星系统源自阿拉伯来源（尤其是Masha'allah、Sahl ibn Bishr），通过中世纪拉丁译本传播。原文提到的"时主星"原本是单独技术（行星时），但Lilly优先使用上升守护星。传统守护星是必需的——现代外行星（天王、海王、冥王）在当代占星师中有争议。

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Significator system as planetary actor assignment determining question outcome through aspect relationships

- **Natural Attributes**:
  - **Symbolism**: Planet = actor, aspect = relationship, dignity = power/welcome
  - **Characteristics**: Binary assignment (querent/quesited), hierarchical (primary/secondary), relational (aspect-dependent)
  - **Elements**: House rulers, natural rulers, Moon, aspects, reception, translation

- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - **Assignment function**: Maps question to specific planets
  - **Relationship function**: Aspect between significators = outcome
  - **Reception function**: Dignity indicates welcome/rejection
  - **Translation function**: Third planet bridges non-aspecting significators

- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - **Literal Layer**: Planet X rules house Y, planet Z rules house W
  - **Symbolic Layer**: Significators = symbolic actors in querent's drama
  - **Practical Layer**: Applying/separating determines yes/no
  - **Psychological Layer**: Significators externalize inner relationship dynamics

### 3. House System - Twelve Life Areas

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Angular houses | Domus Angulares | Houses 1/4/7/10 on angles | Strongest power, quick manifestation |
| Succedent houses | Domus Succedentes | Houses 2/5/8/11 following angles | Moderate power, steady development |
| Cadent houses | Domus Cadentes | Houses 3/6/9/12 falling away | Weakest power, unstable matters |
| Derived houses | Turned houses | Houses counted from another house | Relationship analysis technique |

#### Source Text

"The twelve Houses do represent the whole Universe, and are distinguished by the twelve Signs of the Zodiack. The first House beginneth from the Cusp of the Ascendent, and containeth all that part of Heaven from the Ascendent to the second House-cusp. Every House hath particular signification assigned unto it: the First signifieth Life and Body; the Second, Substance and Wealth; the Third, Brethren and short journeys; and so forth through all twelve."

#### English Paraphrase (Primary Language)

The **twelve houses** divide the celestial sphere into **life areas**, each governing specific matters querent might ask about. Understanding house meanings is **essential to horary**—you must know which house governs the questioned matter to identify correct significator.

**House meanings** (Lilly's classical attributions):

**Angular Houses** (1, 4, 7, 10 - most powerful):
- **1st House**: Querent, body, life, health, appearance, general state
- **4th House**: Father, land, property, endings, hidden things, agriculture, graves
- **7th House**: Spouse, partners, open enemies, lawsuits, contracts, "other person"
- **10th House**: Career, honors, authority, mother, kings, reputation, success

**Succedent Houses** (2, 5, 8, 11 - moderate power):
- **2nd House**: Money, moveable property, profit, possessions, personal resources
- **5th House**: Children, pleasure, gambling, taverns, entertainment, creative works
- **8th House**: Death, inheritance, partner's money, fear, surgery, transformation
- **11th House**: Friends, hopes, wishes, benefits from authority, support networks

**Cadent Houses** (3, 6, 9, 12 - weakest, most unstable):
- **3rd House**: Siblings, short journeys, writing, communication, neighbors, rumors
- **6th House**: Illness, servants, small animals, daily work, employees, uncles/aunts
- **9th House**: Long journeys, religion, higher learning, foreign lands, dreams, law
- **12th House**: Secret enemies, imprisonment, large animals (horses), self-undoing, isolation

**Derived houses** (houses from houses): Count from any house to find related matters:
- **2nd from 7th** (8th house): Partner's money
- **7th from 7th** (1st house): Opponent's opponent (your ally)
- **10th from 10th** (7th house): Career's outcome
- **5th from 5th** (9th house): Grandchildren

**House strength hierarchy**:
1. **Angular**: Strongest, matters manifest quickly, visibility, power
2. **Succedent**: Moderate, matters develop steadily, resources, stability  
3. **Cadent**: Weakest, matters unstable, often fail, communication, thought

**Practical application**: "Will I get the job?"
- **10th house** governs career → 10th house ruler = the job
- **Querent** (1st house ruler) applying to 10th house ruler → YES
- If querent in 10th house → You're already close to position
- If 10th ruler in 6th house → Job involves service/health, or brings illness

#### Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)

**十二宫位**划分生活领域，每宫管特定事项。**角宫**(Angular: 1/4/7/10)最强；**续宫**(Succedent: 2/5/8/11)中等；**果宫**(Cadent: 3/6/9/12)最弱。每宫代表：第1宫=问卜者自身；第2宫=金钱/财产；第3宫=兄弟/沟通/短途；第4宫=家园/父亲/房产/事物结局；第5宫=子女/娱乐/怀孕；第6宫=仆人/疾病/小动物；第7宫=配偶/伴侣/对手/诉讼；第8宫=死亡/遗产/他人金钱；第9宫=长途旅行/宗教/智慧；第10宫=事业/荣誉/母亲；第11宫=朋友/希望/团体；第12宫=敌人/监禁/大动物/自毁。行星在角宫有力量迅速行动；在续宫延迟但最终成功；在果宫软弱难以完成事项。宫位守护星成为相关事项的征象星。

#### Core Points

- **Twelve life areas**: Each house governs specific matters querent asks about
- **Angular strongest**: 1/4/7/10 houses most powerful, matters manifest
- **Succedent moderate**: 2/5/8/11 houses stable, resource-oriented
- **Cadent weakest**: 3/6/9/12 houses unstable, often fail
- **Derived houses**: Count from any house for related matters
- **House identification**: Determines correct quesited significator
- **House strength**: Affects speed and success of manifestation

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Lilly's house meanings largely follow Ptolemy and Arabic sources, but with expanded practical detail. The "angular/succedent/cadent" terminology derives from Greek (kentron/epanaphora/apoklima). Some medieval variations exist—e.g., 9th house as "God's house" (dreams, prophecy) in Arabic texts. The derived house technique ("turned houses") became especially important in horary for relationship questions.
- **中文**: Lilly的宫位意义大体遵循托勒密和阿拉伯来源，但有更详细的实践细节。"角宫/续宫/果宫"术语源自希腊语(kentron/epanaphora/apoklima)。中世纪存在一些变体——如阿拉伯文本中第9宫作为"神之宫"（梦、预言）。衍生宫位技术（"转宫"）在关系问题的卜卦中尤为重要。

### 4. Aspects and Perfection - Temporal-Causal Mechanism

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Source Text

"Aspects are certaine Distances of Degrees, wherein the Planets mutually behold each other, and worke more powerfully: and are either Major or Minor. The Major are five: Conjunction, Sextile, Square, Trine, Opposition. When a significator applies to another by Aspect, and both be in Degrees wherein they shall come to a perfect Aspect before either of them be impedited or turned Retrograde, we say the Aspect perfects, and the thing shall come to passe. But if ere the Aspect be compleat, one of them turn Retrograde, or be combust, or enter another Signe wherein he hath no Aspect with the former Planet, then is the Aspect frustrated, and the thing comes not to effect."

#### Key Term Analysis

- **Mutually behold**: Planets in aspect "see" each other; no aspect = no connection/awareness
- **Perfects**: An applying aspect reaching exact completion; indicates the matter will succeed
- **Impedited**: Hindered or blocked; includes combust, retrograde, besieged by malefics
- **Frustrated**: Aspect cannot complete due to impediment; matter fails or dissolves

#### English Paraphrase (Primary Language)

**Aspects** are the **angular relationships** between planets that determine whether and how matters complete. In horary, aspects are the **primary mechanism** showing outcome—they're not static descriptions but **temporal processes** revealing if/when things manifest.

**The five major aspects**:

**1. Conjunction (0°)** - 合相:
- **Meaning**: Union, merging, beginning, intensity
- **Horary use**: Querent and quesited coming together, matter completes through direct meeting
- **Example**: Querent's ruler conjuncts 7th ruler → marriage/partnership forms

**2. Sextile (60°)** - 六分相:
- **Meaning**: Opportunity, cooperation, mild harmony
- **Horary use**: Favorable outcome with some effort required
- **Example**: Querent's ruler sextiles 2nd ruler → money comes through opportunity you must take

**3. Square (90°)** - 四分相:
- **Meaning**: Tension, obstacle, friction, crisis
- **Horary use**: Matter succeeds but with difficulty, conflict, stress
- **Example**: Querent's ruler squares 10th ruler → get job but with workplace tension

**4. Trine (120°)** - 三分相:
- **Meaning**: Harmony, ease, flow, grace
- **Horary use**: Favorable outcome, easy success, natural completion
- **Example**: Querent's ruler trines 7th ruler → relationship flows naturally

**5. Opposition (180°)** - 对分相:
- **Meaning**: Confrontation, awareness, separation yet connection
- **Horary use**: Matter completes but with opposition, conflict, or open acknowledgment
- **Example**: Querent's ruler opposes enemy significator → lawsuit resolves through confrontation

**Applying vs Separating** (入相vs出相):
- **Applying**: Faster planet moving toward slower, aspect not yet exact → **Future event, YES**
- **Separating**: Faster planet past exact aspect, moving away → **Past event, NO, already happened**
- **Exact/Partile**: Within 1° of perfection → **Imminent, powerful, certain**

**Perfection** (完成): When applying aspect reaches exactitude without impediment:
- **Conditions for perfection**:
  - Both planets continue forward motion (not turning retrograde)
  - Neither planet changes sign before aspect completes (breaks connection)
  - Neither planet combusted by Sun (within ~8°, overwhelmed)
  - Neither planet enters malefic aspect (Mars/Saturn) blocking completion

**Frustration** (阻挫): When aspect cannot perfect:
- **Retrograde**: Planet turns backward before aspect exact → delays, reversal, won't complete as expected
- **Sign change**: Planet enters new sign breaking aspect → connection lost, matter dissolves
- **Combustion**: Planet too close to Sun, weakened → matter overwhelmed by authority/ego
- **Prohibition**: Mars/Saturn aspect intervenes → obstacle blocks completion

**Timing from aspects**: Degrees between planets = time units:
- **Cardinal signs** (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn): Days or weeks
- **Fixed signs** (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius): Months or years
- **Mutable signs** (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces): Weeks or months

**Example**: "Will I get the money owed?"
- Querent's ruler (you) at 10° Gemini
- 2nd ruler (money) at 25° Gemini
- **15° apart** in mutable sign → ~15 weeks or months
- **Applying** (you moving toward money) → YES, you'll recover it
- If 2nd ruler were at 5° Gemini (behind you) → **Separating**, already lost opportunity

#### Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)

**相位**(Aspects)是行星角度关系决定事项是否/如何完成。**入相**(Applying，向精确相位移动)=未来事件/是，征象星正在接近完成。**出相**(Separating，离开精确相位)=过去事件/否，机会已过。**完成**(Perfection)需要无阻碍：无行星介入(prohibition)、无逆行、无出界。**度数差=时间单位**：两征象星相距度数=事件发生时间(语境决定是日/周/月/年)。**五个古典相位**：合相(0°)最强、六合(60°)温和吉、刑(90°)困难凶、拱(120°)和谐吉、冲(180°)对抗凶。**阻碍**：禁止(更快行星在之前截取)、挫败(第三行星介入)、逆行(征象星退回)、燃烧(太近太阳失效)。判断完成只看入相相位，出相相位显示已经发生的事。东西对照：入相/出相 ↔ 六爻的动爻/变爻机制。

#### Core Points

- **Five major aspects**: Conjunction/sextile/square/trine/opposition with different meanings
- **Applying = YES**: Faster planet moving toward slower, future event
- **Separating = NO**: Past exact aspect, opportunity already gone
- **Perfection**: Aspect completes without impediment = matter succeeds
- **Frustration**: Retrograde, sign change, combustion, prohibition = fails
- **Timing**: Degrees between planets = time units (context determines scale)
- **Temporal mechanism**: Aspects show process not static state

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Lilly's aspect doctrine combines Ptolemaic geometry with Arabic timing techniques. The "perfection" concept (applying aspect reaching exactitude) is central to horary judgment. "Frustration" and "prohibition" derive from Masha'allah and Sahl. Modern astrologers sometimes add minor aspects (semi-sextile, quincunx) which Lilly rarely used.
- **中文**: Lilly的相位学说结合了托勒密几何学和阿拉伯时间技术。"完成"概念（入相相位达到精确）是占星判断的核心。"挫败"和"禁止"源自Masha'allah和Sahl。现代占星师有时添加次要相位（半六合、梅花相），Lilly很少使用。

### 5. Dignity and Debility - Power Assessment

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Source Text

"Dignities are certaine Priviledges bestowed upon Planets, whereby they become powerful in Operation, and more effectuall. The principall Dignities are Essential and Accidental. Essential Dignities are when a Planet is in his owne House, Exaltation, Triplicity, Terme, or Face. Accidental Dignities are when a Planet is in an Angle, swift in Motion, in Haiz, joyned to Jupiter or Venus. Debilities are the contrary: when a Planet is in his Detriment, Fall, Peregrination, Retrograde, Combust, Cadent, under Sunbeams, or joyned to maleficks."

#### Key Term Analysis

- **Essential Dignity**: Dignity based on zodiacal sign position; inherent to planet's location in zodiac
- **Accidental Dignity**: Dignity from circumstantial factors (house, motion, aspects); context-dependent
- **Haiz**: Planet in sect-appropriate position (diurnal planet in day chart above horizon)
- **Peregrine**: Planet with no essential dignity; "foreign" or "wandering" without resources
- **Combust**: Planet within ~8° of Sun, overwhelmed and invisible; severely weakened

#### English Paraphrase (Primary Language)

**Dignity** measures a planet's **power and effectiveness** in horary judgment. A dignified planet = strong significator capable of acting successfully. A debilitated planet = weak significator struggling or failing. Dignity assessment is **crucial for judgment**—even perfect applying aspects fail if significators too weak.

**Essential Dignities** (本质尊贵) - based on zodiac sign:

**1. Domicile/Rulership** (+5 points):
- Planet in own sign: Sun in Leo, Moon in Cancer, Mercury in Gemini/Virgo, etc.
- **Maximum power**, acts naturally, fully expressive

**2. Exaltation** (+4 points):
- Planet in sign of greatest power: Sun in Aries, Moon in Taurus, Saturn in Libra, etc.
- **Honored guest**, acts with special effectiveness

**3. Triplicity** (+3 points):
- Planet ruling element (Fire/Earth/Air/Water) in day/night/participating ruler
- **Comfortable**, acts with support

**4. Term** (+2 points):
- Planet ruling specific degree range within sign
- **Moderate power**, acts adequately

**5. Face/Decan** (+1 point):
- Planet ruling 10° section of sign
- **Minimal power**, barely capable

**Essential Debilities** (本质衰弱):

**1. Detriment** (-5 points):
- Planet in sign opposite domicile: Sun in Aquarius, Moon in Capricorn, Mars in Libra
- **Exile**, acts against natural grain, uncomfortable

**2. Fall** (-4 points):
- Planet in sign opposite exaltation: Sun in Libra, Moon in Scorpio, Saturn in Aries
- **Dishonored**, weakened, ineffective

**3. Peregrine** (0 points, but weakened):
- Planet has no essential dignity (not in any of 5 above)
- **Stranger**, wandering, no resources or support

**Accidental Dignities** (偶然尊贵) - based on house/motion/aspects:

**Strengthening**:
- **Angular** (in 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th houses): +5, maximum visibility/power
- **Direct motion** at average speed: +2, effective action
- **Swift motion** (faster than average): +2, eager action
- **Oriental** (rising before Sun): +2, independence
- **Free from combustion**: +5, not overwhelmed by Sun
- **Cazimi** (exact conjunction with Sun, within 17'): +5, heart of Sun, empowered
- **Conjunct Jupiter**: +5, fortunate, expanded
- **Conjunct Venus**: +3, pleasant, attractive
- **Trine/sextile Jupiter/Venus**: +3, benefic support

**Weakening**:
- **Cadent** (in 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th houses): -5, hidden, ineffective
- **Retrograde**: -5, reversed, delayed, inward
- **Slow motion**: -2, sluggish, reluctant
- **Occidental** (setting after Sun): -2, subordinate
- **Combust** (within ~8° of Sun): -5, overwhelmed, invisible
- **Under sunbeams** (within 17° of Sun): -4, weakened by Sun
- **Besieged** (between Mars and Saturn): -5, trapped, attacked
- **Conjunct/oppose Mars/Saturn**: -3/-5, afflicted by malefics

**Practical judgment**: Tally dignity points for each significator:
- **+10 or more**: Very strong, matter succeeds easily
- **+5 to +9**: Strong, matter succeeds with effort
- **0 to +4**: Weak, matter difficult, may fail
- **-5 or below**: Very weak, matter likely fails

**Example**: "Will I win the lawsuit?"
- **Your significator** (Ascendant ruler): Mars in Capricorn (fall -4), retrograde (-5), in 1st house (+5) = **-4 points** (weak)
- **Opponent** (7th ruler): Venus in Pisces (exalted +4), direct, in 7th house (+5), trine Jupiter (+3) = **+12 points** (very strong)
- **Judgment**: Opponent stronger, even if applying aspect exists, you'll likely lose or settle unfavorably

#### Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)

**尊贵**(Dignity)与**衰弱**(Debility)度量行星力量，决定征象星是否有力量达成事项。**本质尊贵**：入庙(Domicile，+5分，如火星在白羊)、擢升(Exaltation，+4分，如太阳在白羊)、三分(Triplicity，+3分)、界(Term，+2分)、面(Face，+1分)。**偶然尊贵**：角宫(+5分)、续宫(+4分)、顺行(+4分)、吉相位(+3-5分)、月亮增光(+2分)、速度快(+2分)。**本质衰弱**：失势(Detriment，-5分，如火星在天秤)、落陷(Fall，-4分，如太阳在天秤)、游魂(Peregrine，0分，无尊贵)。**偶然衰弱**：果宫(-5分)、逆行(-5分)、凶相位(-3-5分)、燃烧(-5分)、太阳光束下(-4分)、速度慢(-2分)。**判断原则**：总分+5以上=强有力完成；-5以下=软弱无力失败；0分附近=勉强或部分成功。尊贵强的征象星能克服困难达成愿望；衰弱的征象星即使有入相相位也可能失败。

#### Core Points

- **Dignity = power**: Measures planet's strength and effectiveness
- **Essential dignity**: Based on zodiac sign (domicile +5 to face +1)
- **Essential debility**: Detriment -5, fall -4, peregrine 0
- **Accidental dignity**: Based on house/motion/aspects (angular +5, benefic aspects +3-5)
- **Accidental debility**: Cadent -5, retrograde -5, malefic aspects -3-5, combustion -5
- **Point system**: Tally dignities for judgment strength
- **Judgment impact**: Even perfect aspects fail if significators too weak

- **English**: Lilly's dignity system synthesizes Ptolemy (essential dignities), Dorotheus (triplicity rulers), and Arabic refinements (terms, faces). The point-scoring system (domicile +5, face +1, etc.) is Lilly's practical adaptation for judgment. "Haiz" (Arabic) and "sect" (Greek hairesis) add day/night considerations. Modern astrologers debate outer planet dignities (Uranus in Aquarius?).
- **中文**: Lilly的尊贵系统综合了托勒密（本质尊贵）、多罗修斯（三分主）和阿拉伯细化（界、面）。分数系统（入庙+5、面+1等）是Lilly的实用判断改编。"Haiz"（阿拉伯语）和"sect"（希腊语haeresis）添加了日/夜考量。现代占星师争论外行星尊贵（天王在水瓶？）。

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Dignity as power-assessment system measuring planetary capacity to effectively accomplish signified matters

- **Natural Attributes**:
  - **Symbolism**: Domicile = home, exaltation = throne, peregrine = stranger, combust = overwhelmed
  - **Characteristics**: Hierarchical (+5 to -5), cumulative (points add), binary (essential vs accidental)
  - **Elements**: Five essential dignities, multiple accidental factors, point-based assessment

- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - **Capacity function**: Determines if planet can accomplish task
  - **Strength function**: Measures relative power between significators
  - **Judgment function**: Modifies aspect interpretation (weak planet can't deliver even if applying)
  - **Compensation function**: Multiple weak dignities or single strong can balance

- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - **Literal Layer**: Mathematical point calculation from tables
  - **Symbolic Layer**: Planet's social status (king, guest, exile, prisoner)
  - **Practical Layer**: Will party have resources/ability to act successfully
  - **Psychological Layer**: Internal capacity, confidence, resources available

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

> If the Querent is likely to live long yea or not: Consider the Lord of the Ascendant, whether he be in an Angle, especially in the 1st or 10th, and in Essential Dignity, free from Combustion and the malefic rays of Saturn or Mars; if so, the Native may live long. If the Lord of the Ascendant be Cadent, Peregrine, Combust, or afflicted by Malefics, life is short or health poor.

### 5D. Fourth House Questions – Parents, Property, Hidden Things

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 4th House | Imum Coeli (IC) | House of father, land, endings | Property and inheritance |
| Lord of 4th | Dominus 4 | Ruler of 4th house cusp | Father/property significator |
| End of matter | Finis rei | Outcome of any question | 4th shows conclusions |

**Source Text** (Synthesized from Lilly Book II, Ch. 4):
> Of buying and selling Lands, Houses, Farms: The 4th house signifies the Land or House itself; its Lord shows the quality thereof. If L4 be well dignified, the purchase is good; if afflicted or in Cadent house, there are hidden defects. To find a thing hid or mislaid: Consider the 4th house and its Lord, also the Moon. The sign on 4th cusp describes the place; L4 position shows where it lies.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Fourth House Questions** address father, real estate, hidden things, and endings:

| Question Type | Judgment Method |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Should I buy property? | L4 dignified = good property; L4 afflicted = defects |
| Is father well? | L4 condition shows father's state |
| Where is hidden thing? | 4th sign = place type; L4 position = specific location |
| What is the end? | 4th house condition shows final outcome |

**完整中文诠释**：第四宫问题涉及父亲、不动产、隐藏物和结局。买房产：L4有尊贵=好房产；L4受克=有缺陷。父亲状况：L4状态显示父亲状态。隐藏物位置：4宫星座=地点类型；L4位置=具体位置。结局：4宫状态显示最终结果。

#### Core Points

- **Property questions**: L4 dignity indicates property quality
- **Father questions**: L4 condition shows father's wellbeing
- **Hidden things**: 4th sign describes location type

### 5E. Fifth House Questions – Children, Pregnancy, Pleasure

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 5th House | Filii | House of children and pleasure | Fertility and creativity |
| Lord of 5th | Dominus 5 | Ruler of 5th house cusp | Children significator |
| Fertile signs | Signa fertilia | Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces (Water) | Pregnancy indicators |

**Source Text** (Synthesized from Lilly Book II, Ch. 5):
> If one shall have children: Consider the Lord of the 5th, the Lord of the 1st, and the Moon. If these be in Fruitful Signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) or aspecting planets in such signs, children are likely. If L5 and L1 be in Barren Signs (Gemini, Leo, Virgo) and the Moon likewise, children are denied. Whether she is with child: If the Moon be in aspect with L5, and both in Fruitful Signs, she is with child.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Fifth House Questions** address children, pregnancy, pleasure, and creativity:

| Question Type | Judgment Method |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Will I have children? | L5/L1/Moon in fertile signs = yes; barren signs = no |
| Is she pregnant? | Moon aspecting L5, both in fertile signs = yes |
| Is child male or female? | Masculine signs/planets = male; feminine = female |
| When is birth? | Degrees between Moon and L5 = time to delivery |

**完整中文诠释**：第五宫问题涉及子女、怀孕、娱乐和创造力。会有孩子吗：L5/L1/月亮在多产星座=是；贫瘠星座=否。是否怀孕：月亮与L5成相，均在多产星座=是。男孩女孩：阳性星座/行星=男；阴性=女。何时生产：月亮与L5间度数=到分娩时间。

#### Core Points

- **Fertility questions**: L5/L1/Moon in fertile signs indicates children
- **Pregnancy**: Moon aspecting L5 in fertile signs confirms pregnancy
- **Gender**: Masculine vs feminine signs/planets indicates sex
- **Timing**: Degrees between significators = time to birth

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_lilly_5th_001]` `[trigger: fertility_judgment]` `[factor_trigger: L5_fertile_sign]` `[role: 主干]` L5, L1, and Moon in fruitful signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) = children likely. → Christian Astrology 5th House

## PART 2: Horary Question Types (P1 Expansion)

### 6. Relationship Questions – Marriage and Partnership

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 1st-7th axis | Self-Other axis | Querent vs partner houses | All relationship questions |
| Reception | Receptio | Planet in another's dignity | Mutual welcome indicator |
| Translation of light | Translatio luminis | Third planet connecting two | Intermediary facilitates |
| Combust | Combustus | Within 8° of Sun | Overwhelmed, weakened |

**Source Text** (Synthesized from Lilly Book II):
> In questions concerning marriage, the Ascendant and its Lord represent the Querent; the 7th House and its Lord the Quesited (proposed spouse). If there be Application between the two Lords by Sextile, Trine, or (in some cases) Conjunction or Square, with Reception, marriage may follow. If separation, or neither application nor reception exists, marriage is denied.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Marriage/Partnership questions** use the 1st–7th house axis:

| Significator | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| Ascendant Lord (L1) | Querent (person asking) |
| 7th House Lord (L7) | Proposed partner |
| Moon | Co-significator of querent, event flow |
| Venus | General significator of love/women |
| Sun | General significator of men |

**Judgment patterns**:

| Configuration | Outcome |
|--------------|---------|
| L1–L7 applying with reception | Marriage likely; mutual interest |
| L1–L7 applying without reception | Marriage possible but one-sided |
| L1–L7 separating | Missed opportunity; relationship ending |
| L1 or L7 combust/retrograde | Party is weakened/unwilling |
| Translation of light (3rd planet) | Third party facilitates union |

**Timing**: Degrees to perfection = time units (context determines days/weeks/months).

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**婚姻/合作问题**使用 1–7 宫轴：

| 象征星 | 含义 |
|--------|------|
| 上升主星 (L1) | 问卜者（提问人） |
| 第七宫主星 (L7) | 被问对象（潜在伴侣） |
| 月亮 | 问卜者的副象征星、事件流 |
| 金星 | 爱情/女性的一般象征星 |
| 太阳 | 男性的一般象征星 |

**判断模式**：

| 配置 | 结果 |
|------|------|
| L1–L7 入相且有互容 | 婚姻可能；双方有意 |
| L1–L7 入相但无互容 | 婚姻可能但单方面 |
| L1–L7 出相 | 错过机会；关系结束 |
| L1 或 L7 焦伤/逆行 | 一方弱化/不愿意 |
| 光的传递（第三行星） | 第三方促成结合 |

**时间**：到成相的度数 = 时间单位（语境决定天/周/月）。

**Core Points**:
- 1st–7th axis for all partnership questions.
- Application with reception = mutual interest.
- Translation of light = intermediary facilitates.
- Combust/retrograde = party weakened or unwilling.

#### Narrative Snippets

- `[ns_lilly_023]` `[trigger: horary_marriage]` `[factor_trigger: horary_7th_house]` `[role: 主干]` In questions concerning marriage, the Ascendant and its Lord represent the Querent; the 7th House and its Lord the Quesited spouse. → Christian Astrology Marriage
- `[ns_lilly_024]` `[trigger: application_reception]` `[factor_trigger: aspect_application AND reception AND astro_marriage_success]` `[role: 主干依赖]` If there be Application between the two Lords by Sextile, Trine, or Conjunction with Reception, marriage may follow. If separation, marriage is denied. → Christian Astrology Marriage
- `[ns_lilly_025]` `[trigger: translation_light]` `[factor_trigger: translation_of_light AND astro_intermediary_union]` `[role: 条件分支]` Translation of light: a third planet separating from one significator and applying to another facilitates union through intermediary. → Christian Astrology Marriage
- `[ns_lilly_026]` `[trigger: combust_retrograde]` `[factor_trigger: combust OR retrograde AND astro_party_weakness]` `[role: 总结]` L1 or L7 combust or retrograde indicates that party is weakened, overwhelmed, or unwilling to proceed. → Christian Astrology Marriage

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Lilly devotes extensive chapters to marriage questions, reflecting 17th-century social importance. The 1st-7th axis is universal for "self vs other" questions. "Reception" (planet in another's dignity) indicates mutual welcome—a key medieval Arabic technique. Modern practitioners add outer planets for unconventional relationships.
- **中文**: Lilly用大量章节讨论婚姻问题，反映了17世纪的社会重要性。1-7宫轴适用于所有"自我vs他人"问题。"接纳"（行星在另一行星的尊贵）表示相互欢迎——关键的中世纪阿拉伯技术。现代实践者为非传统关系添加外行星。

<!-- L2_BEGIN -->

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Horary judgment of marriage and partnership questions using 1st-7th house axis and significator relationships

- **Natural Attributes**:
  - **Symbolism**: 1st-7th axis represents self-other polarity; L1 = querent, L7 = partner; Moon = emotional flow
  - **Characteristics**: Binary relationship structure; application/separation dynamics; reception as mutual interest indicator
  - **Elements**: House lords as primary significators; Venus/Sun as general love significators; aspects as relationship dynamics

- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - **Mapping function**: Querent → 1st house, Partner → 7th house, Relationship → L1-L7 aspect
  - **Prediction function**: Application with reception = marriage likely; Separation = denial
  - **Timing function**: Degrees to perfection = time units (days/weeks/months by context)
  - **Facilitation function**: Translation of light = third party enables connection

- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**:
    - Question sincere about specific relationship
    - Chart radical (proper Ascendant degree, Moon not void)
    - L1 and L7 identifiable and not mutual (same planet)
  - **Enhancing Conditions**:
    - Application between L1-L7 with mutual reception
    - Moon applying to L7 after L1
    - Venus/Sun dignified and well-placed
  - **Nullifying Conditions**:
    - L1 or L7 combust (within 8° of Sun)
    - L1 or L7 retrograde (unwillingness)
    - Separating aspect (opportunity past)
    - Moon void of course (matter dissolves)
  - **Temporal Scope**:
    - [x] Natal layer: N/A (horary-specific technique)
    - [x] Transit layer: Applied at question moment
    - [ ] Progression layer: Not applicable

- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - **Literal Layer**: L1 in sign X, L7 in sign Y, applying/separating by Z aspect
  - **Symbolic Layer**: Planets as actors in relationship drama; aspects as relationship dynamics
  - **Practical Layer**: Application with reception → marriage proceeds; separation → relationship ends
  - **Psychological Layer**: Chart externalizes querent's relationship dynamics and unconscious awareness

### 7. Career and Finance Questions – Job and Wealth

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 10th house | Domus X / Medium Coeli | Career, profession, public status | Employer, position sought |
| 6th house | Domus VI | Daily work, service | Job itself, labor conditions |
| 2nd house | Domus II | Movable wealth, income | Salary, personal resources |
| 11th house | Domus XI | Hopes, gains | Benefits from profession |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Career/Job questions** primarily use:

| House | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10th | Career, profession, reputation, employer |
| 6th | Daily work, service, subordinates |
| 2nd | Personal income, movable wealth |
| 11th | Hopes, gains from profession |

**Job application pattern**:

| Significator | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| L1 | Querent (applicant) |
| L10 | Employer/position |
| L6 | The job itself (daily work) |

**Judgment patterns**:

| Configuration | Outcome |
|--------------|---------|
| L1 applying to L10 with reception | Good chance; employer receptive |
| L10 applying to L1 | Employer seeks querent |
| L1 in 10th, dignified | Strong position; success |
| L1/L10 afflicted or retrograde | Obstacles; delays |

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**职业/工作问题**主要使用：

| 宫位 | 含义 |
|------|------|
| 第10宫 | 事业、职业、声誉、雇主 |
| 第6宫 | 日常工作、服务、下属 |
| 第2宫 | 个人收入、动产 |
| 第11宫 | 希望、职业所得 |

**求职模式**：

| 象征星 | 含义 |
|--------|------|
| L1 | 问卜者（申请人） |
| L10 | 雇主/职位 |
| L6 | 工作本身（日常劳动） |

**Core Points**:
- 10th = employer/profession; 6th = daily work; 2nd = income.
- Application with reception = favorable hiring.
- L1 in 10th dignified = strong candidacy.

#### Narrative Snippets

- `[ns_lilly_027]` `[trigger: horary_career]` `[factor_trigger: horary_10th_house]` `[role: 主干]` For career questions: 10th house = employer/profession/status; 6th house = daily work itself; 2nd house = income. → Christian Astrology Career
- `[ns_lilly_028]` `[trigger: job_application]` `[factor_trigger: L1_L10_aspect AND astro_employer_receptive]` `[role: 主干依赖]` L1 applying to L10 with reception indicates employer is receptive; L10 applying to L1 means employer seeks the querent. → Christian Astrology Career
- `[ns_lilly_029]` `[trigger: career_success]` `[factor_trigger: L1_in_10th AND dignity AND astro_career_success]` `[role: 总结]` L1 in 10th house dignified = strong candidacy, favorable position for professional success. → Christian Astrology Career

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: The 10th house for career derives from its position at the meridian (highest visibility). The 6th house for daily labor comes from its traditional association with servants and service. Lilly's distinction (10th = status/employer, 6th = actual work) remains standard. Modern adaptations address self-employment (1st-10th blend) and gig economy.
- **中文**: 第10宫用于事业源于其在子午线的位置（最高可见度）。第6宫用于日常劳动源于其与仆人和服务的传统关联。Lilly的区分（第10宫=地位/雇主，第6宫=实际工作）仍是标准。现代改编处理自雇（1-10宫混合）和零工经济。

### 8. Lost Object Questions – Finding Things

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 2nd house | Domus II | Movable possessions | Primary lost object house |
| Elemental direction | Fire/Earth/Air/Water | Sign element indicates place type | Location method |
| Angular position | In 1st/4th/7th/10th | Object's location relative to querent | Recovery likelihood |

**Source Text** (Synthesized from Lilly Book II):
> For lost goods, examine the Lord of the 2nd house (moveable possessions). If the Lord of the 2nd be in an angle, especially the 1st or 10th, the thing is in the house. If in the 4th, it is hidden or underground. If in the 7th, another person has it. The sign shows direction and nature of place.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Lost object questions** use the 2nd house (movables) or relevant house for the object type:

| House | Object Type |
|-------|-------------|
| 2nd | Personal possessions, money |
| 4th | Real estate, things in home |
| 5th | Recreational items, children's things |
| 6th | Tools, work items, small animals |

**Location indicators**:

| L2 Position | Location |
|-------------|----------|
| In 1st house | Near querent, in their space |
| In 4th house | Hidden, underground, at home |
| In 7th house | With another person |
| In 10th house | At workplace, public place |

**Sign element** indicates nature of place:
- Fire = near heat, fireplaces, kitchens
- Earth = ground level, gardens, storage
- Air = upper rooms, shelves, high places
- Water = near water, bathrooms, damp areas

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**失物问题**使用第2宫（动产）或与物品类型相关的宫位：

| 宫位 | 物品类型 |
|------|----------|
| 第2宫 | 个人财物、金钱 |
| 第4宫 | 不动产、家中物品 |
| 第5宫 | 娱乐物品、孩子的东西 |
| 第6宫 | 工具、工作物品、小动物 |

**位置指示**：

| L2 位置 | 地点 |
|---------|------|
| 在第1宫 | 靠近问卜者，在其空间 |
| 在第4宫 | 隐藏、地下、在家 |
| 在第7宫 | 在他人处 |
| 在第10宫 | 在工作场所、公共场所 |

**星座元素**指示地点性质：
- 火 = 靠近热源、壁炉、厨房
- 土 = 地面层、花园、储藏室
- 风 = 上层房间、架子、高处
- 水 = 靠近水、浴室、潮湿区域

**Core Points**:
- 2nd house lord position shows location.
- Angular = findable; cadent = difficult to find.
- Sign element indicates place nature.
- Moon separating from L2 = object moved recently.

#### Narrative Snippets

- `[ns_lilly_030]` `[trigger: horary_lost_object]` `[factor_trigger: horary_2nd_house]` `[role: 主干]` For lost goods, examine the Lord of the 2nd house. If L2 be in an angle, the thing is in the house. If in the 4th, hidden or underground. If in the 7th, another person has it. → Christian Astrology Lost Objects
- `[ns_lilly_031]` `[trigger: lost_location]` `[factor_trigger: L2_position AND angular]` `[role: 主干依赖]` Angular position = findable; cadent position = difficult to find. The sign element indicates the nature of the place (fire = near heat, water = damp areas). → Christian Astrology Lost Objects
- `[ns_lilly_032]` `[trigger: object_moved]` `[factor_trigger: moon_separating_L2]` `[role: 总结]` Moon separating from L2 indicates the object has been moved recently from its original location. → Christian Astrology Lost Objects

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Lost object horary is one of the most practical applications, with high verifiability. Lilly's elemental-directional system (Fire=East, Earth=South, etc.) derives from Ptolemy. The house-position technique for locating items is Arabic in origin (via Sahl). Modern practitioners often add asteroid positions for specificity.
- **中文**: 失物占星是最实用的应用之一，可验证性高。Lilly的元素-方向系统（火=东、土=南等）源自托勒密。通过宫位定位物品的技术源自阿拉伯（通过Sahl）。现代实践者常添加小行星位置以提高精确度。

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Horary judgment of lost object questions using 2nd house lord position and elemental-directional correspondences

- **Natural Attributes**:
  - **Symbolism**: 2nd house = movable possessions; L2 house position = location; sign element = place nature
  - **Characteristics**: Spatial mapping system; angular/succedent/cadent as findability gradient; elemental place correspondences
  - **Elements**: House lords as location indicators; sign elements as place descriptors; angles as recovery likelihood

- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - **Mapping function**: Object → 2nd house (or relevant house by type), Location → L2 house position
  - **Location function**: Angular = findable, Cadent = difficult; Fire/Earth/Air/Water → place nature
  - **Direction function**: Sign quadruplicity and element indicate direction and environment
  - **Movement function**: Moon separating from L2 = object moved recently

- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**:
    - Sincere question about specific lost item
    - Chart radical and readable
    - L2 identifiable (house lord of movables)
  - **Enhancing Conditions** (for recovery):
    - L2 in angular house (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th)
    - L2 applying to L1 (object returns to owner)
    - Moon applying to L2 (querent finds object)
  - **Nullifying Conditions** (against recovery):
    - L2 in cadent house (3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th)
    - L2 combust, retrograde, or in detriment
    - L2 in 12th = hidden enemies, may not return
  - **Temporal Scope**:
    - [x] Transit layer: Applied at question moment

- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - **Literal Layer**: L2 in house X, in sign Y, angular/cadent
  - **Symbolic Layer**: Houses as spatial zones; signs as environmental descriptors
  - **Practical Layer**: Angular position → findable; element → place nature
  - **Verification Layer**: Horary lost objects highly verifiable by subsequent events

## PART 3: Additional Question Types (P2 Expansion)

### 9. Health and Illness Questions

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 6th house | Domus VI | Disease, illness | Signifies the malady itself |
| L1 vs L6 | Patient vs Disease | Relative strength comparison | Determines recovery prognosis |
| 7th house | Domus VII | Physician, doctor | The healer consulted |
| 10th house | Domus X | Medicine, treatment | The cure applied |

**Source Text** (Synthesized from Lilly Book II):
> In questions of sickness, the Ascendant and its Lord signify the sick person; the 6th House and its Lord, the disease itself; the 7th House, the physician; the 10th, the medicine. If the Lord of the Ascendant be stronger than the Lord of the 6th, the native shall overcome the disease.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Health/Illness questions** use multiple houses:

| House | Significator | Meaning |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| 1st | L1 | The sick person (querent) |
| 6th | L6 | The disease/illness itself |
| 7th | L7 | The physician/doctor |
| 10th | L10 | The medicine/treatment |
| 8th | L8 | Death (if prognosis asked) |

**Judgment patterns**:

| Configuration | Prognosis |
|--------------|-----------|
| L1 stronger than L6 | Recovery likely |
| L6 stronger than L1 | Disease prevails |
| L1 separating from L6 | Already recovering |
| L1 applying to L6 | Getting worse |
| L1 in 6th house | Querent weakened by illness |
| Benefics aspecting L1 | Help and recovery |
| Malefics aspecting L1 | Complications |

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**健康/疾病问题**使用多个宫位：

| 宫位 | 象征星 | 含义 |
|------|--------|------|
| 第1宫 | L1 | 病人（问卜者） |
| 第6宫 | L6 | 疾病本身 |
| 第7宫 | L7 | 医生 |
| 第10宫 | L10 | 药物/治疗 |
| 第8宫 | L8 | 死亡（若问预后） |

**判断模式**：

| 配置 | 预后 |
|------|------|
| L1 比 L6 强 | 可能康复 |
| L6 比 L1 强 | 疾病占上风 |
| L1 离开 L6 | 已在康复 |
| L1 趋近 L6 | 正在恶化 |
| L1 在第6宫 | 问卜者被疾病削弱 |
| 吉星相位 L1 | 有帮助和康复 |
| 凶星相位 L1 | 有并发症 |

**Core Points**:
- 1st house = patient, 6th house = disease
- L1 vs L6 strength determines outcome
- Application/separation shows disease trajectory
- 7th = doctor, 10th = medicine

#### Narrative Snippets

- `[ns_lilly_033]` `[trigger: horary_health]` `[factor_trigger: horary_6th_house]` `[role: 主干]` In sickness questions: 1st house and its lord = the patient; 6th house and its lord = the disease. Compare their dignities to judge who prevails. → Christian Astrology Health
- `[ns_lilly_034]` `[trigger: health_prognosis]` `[factor_trigger: L1_L6_strength AND astro_prognosis]` `[role: 主干依赖]` If L1 stronger than L6, patient overcomes disease. If L6 stronger, disease prevails. L1 separating from L6 = recovering; applying = worsening. → Christian Astrology Health
- `[ns_lilly_035]` `[trigger: medical_help]` `[factor_trigger: horary_7th_doctor AND astro_physician_help]` `[role: 总结]` 7th house = physician consulted; 10th house = medicine/treatment. Benefic aspects to L1 indicate help and recovery. → Christian Astrology Health

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Medical horary was crucial in Lilly's era before modern diagnostics. The 6th house for disease derives from its position opposite the 12th (hidden enemies within). The 7th for physician reflects the "other person consulted." Lilly's method assesses relative strength (patient vs disease) rather than diagnosing specific conditions.
- **中文**: 医疗占星在Lilly时代现代诊断之前至关重要。第6宫用于疾病源于其与第12宫（内在隐敵）的对宫位置。第7宫用于医生反映"被咨询的他人"。Lilly的方法评估相对强度（病人 vs 疾病）而非诊断具体病情。

  - **Prognosis function**: L1 > L6 = recovery; L6 > L1 = disease prevails
  - **Trajectory function**: L1 separating from L6 = recovering; L1 applying to L6 = worsening
  - **Assistance function**: Benefics aspecting L1 = help; Malefics = complications

- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**:
    - Sincere question about specific health concern
    - Chart radical and readable
    - L1 and L6 identifiable
  - **Enhancing Conditions** (for recovery):

    - L7 (doctor) or L10 (medicine) strong
  - **Nullifying Conditions** (against recovery):
    - L6 stronger than L1
    - L1 applying to L6 (disease progressing)
    - Malefics (Saturn, Mars) afflicting L1
    - L8 (death) activated
  - **Temporal Scope**:
    - [x] Transit layer: Applied at question moment

- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - **Literal Layer**: L1 in sign X with dignity Y, L6 in sign Z with dignity W
  - **Symbolic Layer**: Planets as patient and disease in struggle; aspects as battle dynamics
  - **Practical Layer**: Relative strength → prognosis; aspect direction → trajectory
  - **Ethical Layer**: Lilly assesses strength, not diagnoses; modern medical advice essential

| 10th house | Domus X | Judge, authority | Ruling power |
| 4th house | Domus IV | End of matter | Final outcome |

| L10 趋近 L1 | 法官偏向问卜者 |
| L10 趋近 L7 | 法官偏向对手 |
| L1 在第7宫（敌人宫） | 问卜者处于劣势 |
| 月亮传光 L7→L1 | 可能和解/妥协 |

**时间**：L1-L10 相位成相度数 = 到判决的时间。

**Core Points**:
- 1st-7th axis for adversarial matters
- L10 (judge) inclination shows likely ruling
- 4th house = final outcome
- Relative strength determines victor

#### Narrative Snippets

- `[ns_lilly_036]` `[trigger: horary_legal]` `[factor_trigger: horary_7th_adversary AND astro_opponent]` `[role: 主干]` In lawsuits and disputes: 1st house = querent, 7th house = adversary/opponent. The 10th house lord represents the judge who decides between them. → Christian Astrology Legal
- `[ns_lilly_037]` `[trigger: legal_outcome]` `[factor_trigger: L10_inclination AND astro_judge_favor]` `[role: 主干依赖]` L10 applying to L1 = judge favors querent; L10 applying to L7 = judge favors opponent. 4th house shows the final outcome of the matter. → Christian Astrology Legal
- `[ns_lilly_038]` `[trigger: lawsuit_victor]` `[factor_trigger: L1_L7_strength AND astro_lawsuit_victor]` `[role: 总结]` Relative dignity and strength between L1 and L7 determines who prevails in the dispute. → Christian Astrology Legal

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Legal horary was in high demand in 17th-century England's litigious society. The 10th house (authority/judge) deciding between 1st and 7th is fundamental adversarial structure. Lilly successfully predicted outcomes of famous legal cases, building his reputation. The 4th house as "end of matter" is universal in horary.
- **中文**: 法律占星在17世纪英国好讼社会需求很高。第10宫（权威/法官）在第1宫和第7宫之间裁决是基本对抗结构。Lilly成功预测了著名法律案件的结果，建立了他的声誉。第4宫作为"事情结局"在占星中是普遍的。

### 11. Travel Questions

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 3rd house | Domus III | Short journeys, local travel | Nearby destinations |
| 9th house | Domus IX | Long journeys, foreign travel | Distant destinations |
| 7th house | Domus VII | Destination, "other place" | Where traveler goes |
| Void of course | Vacuus cursus | Moon making no aspects before sign change | Journey may not happen |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Travel questions** (journeys, voyages):

| House | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 3rd | Short journeys (local travel) |
| 9th | Long journeys (foreign travel) |
| 1st | Traveler |
| 7th | Destination/place traveled to |

**Judgment patterns**:

| Configuration | Indication |
|--------------|------------|
| L9 well-dignified | Long journey favorable |
| L9 afflicted | Problems during journey |
| L1 applying to L9 with good aspect | Journey proceeds well |
| Malefics in 9th | Dangers on journey |
| L7 strong | Good conditions at destination |
| Moon void of course | Journey may not happen |

**Element of 9th house sign** indicates nature of journey:
- Fire = hot places, deserts
- Water = sea voyages, watery regions
- Air = high places, mountains
- Earth = fertile lands, valleys

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**旅行问题**（旅程、航行）：

| 宫位 | 含义 |
|------|------|
| 第3宫 | 短途旅行（本地出行） |
| 第9宫 | 长途旅行（海外出行） |
| 第1宫 | 旅行者 |
| 第7宫 | 目的地/所去之处 |

**判断模式**：

| 配置 | 指示 |
|------|------|
| L9 有尊贵 | 长途旅行有利 |
| L9 受克 | 旅途中有问题 |
| L1 好相位趋近 L9 | 旅途顺利 |
| 凶星在第9宫 | 旅途有危险 |
| L7 强 | 目的地条件好 |
| 月亮空亡 | 旅行可能不会发生 |

**第9宫星座元素**指示旅途性质：
- 火 = 炎热地区、沙漠
- 水 = 海上航行、水域
- 风 = 高地、山区
- 土 = 肥沃土地、山谷

**Core Points**:
- 3rd = short trips, 9th = long journeys
- L9 condition shows journey quality
- 7th = destination conditions
- Sign element describes terrain

#### Narrative Snippets

- `[ns_lilly_039]` `[trigger: horary_travel]` `[factor_trigger: horary_9th_house AND astro_long_journey]` `[role: 主干]` For travel questions: 3rd house = short journeys; 9th house = long journeys. The 9th house lord's condition shows the quality of the voyage. → Christian Astrology Travel
- `[ns_lilly_040]` `[trigger: journey_quality]` `[factor_trigger: L9_condition AND astro_journey_favorability]` `[role: 主干依赖]` L9 dignified = favorable journey; L9 afflicted = problems en route. Malefics in 9th indicate dangers. 7th house shows destination conditions. → Christian Astrology Travel
- `[ns_lilly_041]` `[trigger: travel_terrain]` `[factor_trigger: sign_element_9th AND astro_terrain_type]` `[role: 总结]` Sign element on 9th cusp describes terrain: Fire = hot regions, Water = sea voyages, Air = highlands, Earth = fertile lands. → Christian Astrology Travel

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: The 3rd/9th house distinction for short/long journeys is classical (Ptolemy). In Lilly's era, "long journeys" often meant sea voyages—dangerous undertakings requiring careful horary judgment. The 7th house as destination derives from its "other place" symbolism. Modern practitioners adapt for air travel (9th house, Air element).
- **中文**: 第3宫/第9宫对应短途/长途的区分是古典的（托勒密）。在Lilly时代，"长途旅行"通常指海上航行——需要仔细占星判断的危险事业。第7宫作为目的地源于其"他处"象征。现代实践者为航空旅行调整（第9宫，风元素）。

#### Narrative Snippets

- `[ns_lilly_042]` `[trigger: horary_purchase]` `[factor_trigger: horary_4th_property AND astro_item_purchased]` `[role: 主干]` For purchases: 1st house = buyer, 7th house = seller. The 4th house represents the property or thing being purchased. 10th house shows the price. → Christian Astrology Purchase
- `[ns_lilly_043]` `[trigger: purchase_quality]` `[factor_trigger: L4_condition]` `[role: 主干依赖]` L4 dignified = property is valuable and sound; L4 afflicted = hidden problems with the item. L7 in 1st = seller is eager, good bargaining position. → Christian Astrology Purchase

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Property transactions were major life events in 17th-century England. The 4th house for real estate is universal (land, home, endings). The 10th as "price" derives from its opposition to 4th (value of the thing). Lilly's purchase method remains standard for real estate horary. Modern adaptations address mortgages (8th house involvement) and investment properties.
- **中文**: 房产交易在17世纪英国是重大生活事件。第4宫用于不动产是普遍的（土地、家庭、结局）。第10宫作为"价格"源于其与第4宫的对宫（事物的价值）。Lilly的购买方法仍是房产占星的标准。现代改编处理抵押贷款（第8宫参与）和投资房产。

## PART 4: Practical Case Studies (Figures Judged)

### 13. Ship at Sea – Safety Judgment

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 1st House (Ship) | Ship itself | The vessel and its condition | Ship's safety |
| Moon | Universal co-sig | Movement and change | Journey progress |
| 9th House | Long voyage | Sea travel house | Voyage conditions |
| Malefics | Saturn/Mars | Dangerous planets | Threats at sea |

**Source Text** (Synthesized from Lilly Book II, pp. 157-165):
> Of a Ship at Sea, her safety or destruction: The Ascendant and the Moon are Significators of the Ship and her Lading. The Lord of the Ascendant signifies the Mariners; if he be an Infortune, the Mariners are knaves. If the Lord of the Ascendant or Moon be joined to an Infortune in angles, the Ship shall be in great danger. If the Lord of the Ascendant or Moon be joined to fortunate Planets, and these in good houses, the Ship shall come safe.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Ship Safety Questions** use specific house assignments:

| Element | Significator |
|---------|--------------|
| Ship itself | Ascendant + Moon |
| Cargo/lading | Moon |
| Mariners/crew | Lord of 1st |
| Voyage conditions | 9th house |
| Danger | Malefics in angles |

**Judgment Criteria**:
- L1/Moon joined to benefics in good houses = safe voyage
- L1/Moon joined to malefics in angles = great danger
- L1 afflicted by Saturn/Mars = ship endangered
- Moon void = journey cancelled or inconclusive

**完整中文诠释**：船只安全问题使用特定宫位分配。船本身=上升+月亮；货物=月亮；船员=L1；航程条件=第9宫；危险=凶星在角宫。判断标准：L1/月亮与吉星在好宫位=安全航行；L1/月亮与凶星在角宫=极大危险；L1被土星/火星克=船有危险；月亮空亡=航程取消或无结论。

#### Core Points

- **Ship = ASC + Moon**: Dual significator for vessel
- **Crew = L1**: Ruler shows mariners' condition
- **Benefic connection = safety**: Jupiter/Venus aspects protect
- **Malefic in angles = danger**: Saturn/Mars threaten voyage

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_lilly_ship_001]` `[trigger: ship_safety]` `[factor_trigger: L1_Moon_benefic AND astro_ship_safety]` `[role: 主干]` L1 or Moon joined to fortunate planets in good houses = ship comes safe. → Christian Astrology Ship
- `[ns_lilly_ship_002]` `[trigger: ship_danger]` `[factor_trigger: L1_Moon_malefic_angular AND astro_ship_danger]` `[role: 主干依赖]` L1 or Moon joined to infortune in angles = ship in great danger. → Christian Astrology Ship
- `[ns_lilly_ship_003]` `[trigger: crew_quality]` `[factor_trigger: L1_nature AND astro_crew_quality]` `[role: 条件分支]` If L1 be an infortune, the mariners are knaves (unreliable). → Christian Astrology Ship

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Ship horary was critically important in 17th-century maritime England. Lilly includes multiple actual ship cases with outcomes recorded. The method treats the ship as a "living entity" with ASC representing its body. Modern practitioners adapt for air travel.
- **中文**: 船只卜卦在17世纪海事英国极为重要。Lilly包含多个实际船只案例并记录结果。该方法将船视为"活实体"，上升代表其身体。现代实践者将此法改编用于航空旅行。

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Ship safety judgment using ASC-Moon dual significator and malefic threat assessment

- **Natural Attributes**:
  - **Symbolism**: Ship as living entity; ASC = hull; Moon = cargo/movement; L1 = crew
  - **Characteristics**: Maritime-specific; angular malefics = danger; benefic aspects = protection
  - **Elements**: ASC, Moon, L1, 9th house, angular malefics

- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - **Safety function**: L1/Moon + benefics in good houses = safe
  - **Danger function**: L1/Moon + malefics in angles = great danger
  - **Crew function**: L1 nature = crew quality (malefic = untrustworthy)
  - **Cargo function**: Moon condition = cargo safety

- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**:
    - Sincere question about specific ship
    - Chart radical
    - L1 and Moon identifiable
  - **Enhancing Conditions** (for safety):
    - L1/Moon aspected by Jupiter/Venus
    - No malefics in angular houses
    - L1 dignified
  - **Nullifying Conditions** (danger):
    - Saturn or Mars in 1st, 4th, 7th, or 10th
    - L1/Moon combust or retrograde
    - Moon void of course

### 14. Theft and Thief Description

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 7th House | Fur/Thief | House of the thief | Thief significator |
| Lord of 7th | Dominus 7 | Ruler of 7th house | Thief's description |
| 2nd House | Substantia | Querent's goods | Stolen property |
| Peregrine planet | Peregrinus | Planet without dignity | Thief indicator |

**Source Text** (Synthesized from Lilly Book II, pp. 319-366):
> Of Theft: The 7th house and his Lord signifies the Thief. The 2nd house signifies the thing stolen. A Peregrine Planet in an angle, especially in the Ascendant or 7th, often describes the Thief. Consider the Lord of the 7th his sign, house, and aspects for description of Thief. Fire signs = ruddy complexion; Earth = swarthy; Air = fair; Water = pale.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Theft Questions** use specific significator assignments:

| Element | Significator |
|---------|--------------|
| Thief | 7th house + L7 |
| Stolen goods | 2nd house + L2 |
| Thief description | L7 sign, house, aspects |
| Recovery | Moon applying to L2 |

**Physical Description by Element**:
| Sign Element | Complexion |
|--------------|------------|
| Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) | Ruddy, red |
| Earth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) | Swarthy, dark |
| Air (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) | Fair, light |
| Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) | Pale, watery |

**完整中文诠释**：盗窃问题使用特定象征星分配。盗贼=第7宫+L7；失物=第2宫+L2；盗贼描述=L7星座/宫位/相位；找回=月亮趋近L2。元素描述面貌：火象（白羊/狮子/射手）=红润；土象（金牛/处女/摩羯）=黝黑；风象（双子/天秤/水瓶）=白皙；水象（巨蟹/天蝎/双鱼）=苍白。

#### Core Points

- **Thief = 7th house**: Open enemy in theft context
- **Peregrine planet**: Often indicates thief (homeless = vagrant)
- **Elemental complexion**: Sign element describes appearance
- **Recovery**: Moon-L2 application shows return

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_lilly_theft_001]` `[trigger: thief_significator]` `[factor_trigger: L7_thief AND astro_thief_significator]` `[role: 主干]` The 7th house and its Lord signifies the Thief. Peregrine planet in angle often describes thief. → Christian Astrology Theft
- `[ns_lilly_theft_002]` `[trigger: thief_description]` `[factor_trigger: L7_sign_element AND astro_thief_appearance]` `[role: 主干依赖]` Fire signs = ruddy; Earth = swarthy; Air = fair; Water = pale complexion. → Christian Astrology Theft
- `[ns_lilly_theft_003]` `[trigger: recovery_indicator]` `[factor_trigger: Moon_L2_apply AND astro_goods_recovery]` `[role: 条件分支]` Moon applying to L2 or dispositor of L2 = goods shall be recovered. → Christian Astrology Theft

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Theft horary was major practice in Lilly's time. He accurately predicted thief characteristics in documented cases. The peregrine planet technique is unique to horary. Modern ethics questions using astrology to identify thieves.
- **中文**: 盗窃卜卦在Lilly时代是主要实践。他在记录案例中准确预测盗贼特征。游魂行星技术是卜卦独有。现代伦理对用占星识别盗贼有疑问。

<!-- L1_END -->

<!-- L2_BEGIN -->

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Theft judgment using 7th house for thief and elemental description system

- **Natural Attributes**:
  - **Symbolism**: 7th as enemy/other; peregrine = homeless vagrant; elements = complexion
  - **Characteristics**: Descriptive-forensic; L7 describes thief; elements map to appearance
  - **Elements**: 7th house, L7, 2nd house, L2, peregrine planets, elemental complexion

- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - **Thief function**: L7 + peregrine planet = thief identification
  - **Description function**: L7 sign element = physical appearance
  - **Recovery function**: Moon-L2 application = goods return
  - **Location function**: L7 house position = where thief is

- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**:
    - Sincere question about specific theft
    - Chart radical
    - L7 and L2 identifiable
  - **Enhancing Conditions** (for recovery):
    - Moon applying to L2 or its dispositor
    - L2 in good dignity
    - No malefics afflicting L2

### 15. War and Battle Outcomes

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Latin/English | Definition | Significance |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 1st House | Querent/Our side | Our army or party | Our forces |
| 7th House | Enemy/Adversary | Opposing army | Enemy forces |
| 10th House | Victory/King | Authority and outcome | Who prevails |
| Part of Fortune | General fortune | Success indicator | Overall outcome |

**Source Text** (Synthesized from Lilly Book II, pp. 361-401):
> Of Battle, War, or other contentions: The Ascendant signifies the Querent or the Party we favour; the 7th house the Enemy. Consider which Lord is stronger in Essential and Accidental dignity—that party shall overcome. If Lord of 1st be stronger, we prevail; if Lord of 7th be stronger, the Enemy wins. The Moon translating light between them may show treaty or intermediary.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**War/Battle Questions** use adversarial house structure:

| Element | Significator |
|---------|--------------|
| Our side | 1st house + L1 |
| Enemy | 7th house + L7 |
| Victory | 10th house, Part of Fortune |
| Commanders | L10 (our), L4 (enemy's 10th) |

**Victory Determination**:
- L1 > L7 in dignity = our side wins
- L7 > L1 in dignity = enemy wins
- Moon translating light = treaty possible
- Mars strong = decisive battle; Saturn = prolonged siege

**完整中文诠释**：战争/战斗问题使用对抗宫位结构。我方=第1宫+L1；敌方=第7宫+L7；胜利=第10宫+福点；指挥官=L10（我方），L4（敌方的第10）。胜利判断：L1尊贵>L7=我方胜；L7>L1=敌方胜；月亮传光=可能和谈；火星强=决战；土星=持久围攻。

#### Core Points

- **Adversarial structure**: 1st vs 7th determines victor
- **Dignity comparison**: Stronger significator wins
- **Commanders**: L10 for our side, L4 for enemy's commander
- **Moon mediation**: Translation of light = negotiation

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_lilly_war_001]` `[trigger: war_structure]` `[factor_trigger: L1_L7_comparison AND astro_war_parties]` `[role: 主干]` 1st house = our party; 7th = enemy. Whichever Lord is stronger in dignity, that party shall overcome. → Christian Astrology War
- `[ns_lilly_war_002]` `[trigger: victory_determination]` `[factor_trigger: dignity_comparison AND astro_victory_determination]` `[role: 主干依赖]` If L1 stronger, we prevail; if L7 stronger, enemy wins. Mars strong = decisive battle. → Christian Astrology War
- `[ns_lilly_war_003]` `[trigger: treaty_possibility]` `[factor_trigger: Moon_translating AND astro_treaty_possibility]` `[role: 条件分支]` Moon translating light between L1 and L7 may show treaty or intermediary bringing peace. → Christian Astrology War

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Lilly famously predicted outcomes of English Civil War battles. His Reading siege prediction (1643) brought him fame. War horary uses same principles as lawsuit (7th house opposition) but with military terminology.
- **中文**: Lilly著名地预测了英国内战战役结果。他的雷丁围城预测（1643年）使他成名。战争卜卦使用与诉讼相同原则（第7宫对抗），但用军事术语。

<!-- L2_BEGIN -->

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: War and battle judgment using 1st-7th opposition and dignity comparison

- **Natural Attributes**:
  - **Symbolism**: 1st/7th as opposing armies; dignity = military strength; L10/L4 = commanders
  - **Characteristics**: Adversarial-comparative; strength determines victor
  - **Elements**: 1st house, 7th house, L1, L7, dignity scores, Mars, Saturn

- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - **Victory function**: L1 vs L7 dignity → winner determination
  - **Commander function**: L10 = our commander; L4 = enemy commander
  - **Battle type function**: Mars = decisive; Saturn = siege
  - **Treaty function**: Moon translation = negotiation possible

- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**:
    - Sincere question about specific conflict
    - Chart radical
    - L1 and L7 identifiable
  - **Victory for our side**:
    - L1 stronger than L7 in essential dignity
    - L1 in angular house
    - Benefics supporting L1
  - **Victory for enemy**:
    - L7 stronger than L1
    - Malefics afflicting L1
