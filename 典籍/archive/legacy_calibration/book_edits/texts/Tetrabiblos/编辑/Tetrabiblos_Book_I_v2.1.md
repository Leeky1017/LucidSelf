## PART 1: Epistemological Foundation (Chapters I-III)

### 1. Proem: Two Preliminary Studies (Chapter I)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 971-1006):
> The studies preliminary to astronomical prognostication, O Syrus! are two: the one, first alike in order and in power, leads to the knowledge of the figurations of the Sun, the Moon, and the stars; and of their relative aspects to each other, and to the earth: the other takes into consideration the changes which their aspects create, by means of their natural properties, in objects under their influence. The first mentioned study has been already explained in the Syntaxis to the utmost practicable extent; for it is complete in itself, and of essential utility even without being blended with the second; to which this treatise will be devoted, and which is not equally self-complete. The present work shall, however, be regulated by that due regard for truth which philosophy demands: and since the material quality of the objects acted upon renders them weak and variable, and difficult to be accurately apprehended, no positive or infallible rules can be here set forth.

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Astronomical prognostication**: προγνωστική - predictive science based on celestial observations, distinct from mere fortune-telling
- **Figurations**: σχηματισμοί - geometric configurations/aspects between celestial bodies
- **Natural properties**: φυσικαί δυνάμεις - inherent physical qualities (hot/cold, moist/dry) causing effects
- **Syntaxis**: The Almagest, Ptolemy's mathematical astronomy treatise
- **The Ambient**: περιέχον - the surrounding celestial environment affecting all earthly things

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy establishes a rigorous two-tier epistemological framework distinguishing **astronomy** (mathematical celestial science) from **astrology** (interpretive application). The first study—astronomy—is "first alike in order and in power," meaning it is both logically prior and more certain. Astronomy calculates precise planetary positions, aspects, and configurations through mathematical demonstration; it was already fully treated in the *Almagest*. The second study—astrology or "astronomical prognostication"—examines how these configurations produce changes in terrestrial life through the planets' **natural properties**.

Crucially, Ptolemy acknowledges astrology's inherent limitations: because material things are "weak and variable," no **infallible rules** can be established. This epistemic humility distinguishes Ptolemy's scientific astrology from dogmatic fortune-telling. He grounds astrology in Aristotelian natural philosophy—planets influence Earth through physical causation (heat, cold, moisture, dryness), not divine will or magical sympathy. The framework is naturalistic and mechanistic, positioning astrology as a branch of physics rather than religion.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密在开篇即建立了严格的双层认识论框架，明确区分**天文学**（数学天体科学）与**占星学**（解释性应用）。第一门学问——天文学——"在次序和力量上都是第一位的"，意即它在逻辑上优先且更为确定。天文学通过数学证明计算精确的行星位置、相位和配置；这在《天文学大成》（Almagest）中已有完整论述。第二门学问——占星学或"天文预测"——研究这些配置如何通过行星的**自然属性**在地上生命中产生变化。

关键地，托勒密承认占星学的内在局限：由于物质事物"脆弱易变"，不可能建立**绝对可靠的规则**。这种认识论上的谦逊将托勒密的科学占星学与教条式算命区分开来。他将占星学奠基于亚里士多德自然哲学——行星通过物理因果（热、冷、湿、干）影响地球，而非神意或魔法感应。这一框架是自然主义和机械论的，将占星学定位为物理学的分支而非宗教。

**Core Points**:
- Two distinct disciplines: Astronomy (mathematical) and Astrology (interpretive)
- Astronomy is prior in order (logical sequence) and power (certainty)
- Astronomy = demonstrative science; Astrology = conjectural art
- Planets influence through natural properties, not divine intervention
- No infallible rules possible due to material variability
- Astrology depends on astronomy but is not self-complete
- Naturalistic framework: physical causation, not magical sympathy
- Epistemic humility distinguishes scientific from dogmatic astrology

**Detailed Explanation**:
This proem is foundational for understanding Ptolemy's entire astrological system. By explicitly subordinating astrology to astronomy, he accomplishes several rhetorical and philosophical goals: (1) legitimates astrology by connecting it to respected mathematical science; (2) maintains epistemic humility about astrology's conjectural nature; (3) establishes proper methodology—precise calculation first, cautious interpretation second; (4) grounds the system in Aristotelian physics rather than Platonic mysticism or religious revelation.

The phrase "natural properties" (φυσικαί δυνάμεις) is philosophically crucial. Ptolemy explicitly adopts a naturalistic causation model: planets possess inherent elemental qualities (hot/cold, moist/dry) that mechanistically affect sublunary matter through the medium of the atmosphere (the Ambient). This distinguishes his approach from magical or theurgical astrology that relied on divine intervention or occult sympathies.

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: The Greek original uses προγνωστική (prognostikē) rather than ἀστρολογία, emphasizing prediction over symbolism. Ashmand's translation "astronomical prognostication" preserves this technical distinction. The Syntaxis reference confirms Ptolemy authored both works.
- **中文**: 希腊原文使用προγνωστική（预测科学）而非ἀστρολογία（占星学），强调预测而非象征。Ashmand的翻译"astronomical prognostication"保留了这一技术区分。对《大成》的引用确认托勒密是两部著作的作者。

### 2. Knowledge May Be Acquired by Astronomy (Chapter II)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1014-1166):
> That a certain power, derived from the æthereal nature, is diffused over and pervades the whole atmosphere of the earth, is clearly evident to all men. Fire and air, the first of the sublunary elements, are encompassed and altered by the motions of the æther. These elements in their turn encompass all inferior matter, and vary it as they themselves are varied; acting on earth and water, on plants and animals... The Sun, always acting in connection with the Ambient, contributes to the regulation of all earthly things... The Moon, being of all the heavenly bodies the nearest to the Earth, also dispenses much influence... The stars likewise produce many impressions on the Ambient. They cause heats, winds, and storms, to the influence of which earthly things are conformably subjected... From these premises it follows not only that all bodies, which may be already compounded, are subjected to the motion of the stars, but also that the impregnation and growth of the seeds from which all bodies proceed, are framed and moulded by the quality existing in the Ambient at the time of such impregnation and growth.

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Æthereal nature**: αἰθήρ - the fifth element, superlunary substance transmitting celestial influence
- **The Ambient**: περιέχον - the total environmental configuration of celestial and elemental forces
- **Sublunary elements**: Fire, Air, Water, Earth - the four terrestrial elements affected by celestial motion
- **Impregnation**: σπορά - the moment of conception/seeding when celestial influence is imprinted

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy establishes the **physical mechanism** by which celestial bodies influence terrestrial life. The key concept is the **Ambient** (περιέχον)—the total configuration of celestial and elemental influences pervading Earth's atmosphere. The causal chain operates as follows: (1) The **æther** (fifth element) constitutes the celestial spheres and transmits their motions; (2) These motions alter the **sublunary elements** (fire and air first, then earth and water); (3) The altered elements affect all terrestrial matter including plants, animals, and humans.

Each celestial body contributes distinctly: The **Sun** regulates seasons and daily variations in heat/moisture through its position relative to the zenith. The **Moon**, being nearest Earth, strongly affects moisture—governing tides, plant growth, and bodily fluids. The **fixed stars and planets** produce atmospheric phenomena (winds, storms) through their configurations.

Crucially, Ptolemy argues that this influence operates not only on existing bodies but on **seeds and embryos** at the moment of impregnation. This establishes the theoretical basis for natal astrology: the celestial configuration at conception/birth permanently imprints the individual's constitution.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密在此章建立了天体影响地上生命的**物理机制**。核心概念是**环境/周天**（περιέχον）——弥漫在地球大气中的天体与元素影响力的总体配置。因果链条如下运作：（1）**以太**（第五元素）构成天球并传递其运动；（2）这些运动改变**月下元素**（首先是火和气，然后是土和水）；（3）改变后的元素影响所有地上物质，包括植物、动物和人类。

每个天体都有独特贡献：**太阳**通过其相对于天顶的位置调节季节和每日的热/湿变化。**月亮**因最靠近地球，强烈影响湿度——支配潮汐、植物生长和体液。**恒星和行星**通过其配置产生大气现象（风、暴风雨）。

关键的是，托勒密论证这种影响不仅作用于现存物体，还作用于受孕时刻的**种子和胚胎**。这为本命占星学建立了理论基础：受孕/出生时的天体配置永久地印刻在个体的体质中。

**Core Points**:
- Æthereal power diffuses through Earth's atmosphere (the Ambient)
- Causal chain: æther → fire/air → earth/water → plants/animals
- Sun regulates seasons and daily heat/moisture variations
- Moon governs tides, moisture, and bodily fluids (nearest to Earth)
- Stars and planets produce atmospheric phenomena through configurations
- Influence operates on seeds/embryos at conception—basis for natal astrology
- The Ambient = total celestial-elemental configuration at any moment
- Physical causation model, not magical or divine

**Detailed Explanation**:
This chapter provides the cosmological physics underlying Ptolemaic astrology. The model is thoroughly Aristotelian: the universe consists of concentric spheres with Earth at center, surrounded by the elemental spheres (earth, water, air, fire) and then the celestial spheres (Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, fixed stars). The æther—the fifth element—fills the celestial realm and transmits motion downward through the elemental chain.

The concept of **imprinting at conception** is philosophically crucial. Ptolemy argues that seeds and embryos are particularly receptive to celestial influence because they are in a formative state. The configuration of the Ambient at the moment of conception/birth becomes permanently encoded in the individual's physical and psychological constitution. This provides the theoretical justification for natal chart interpretation: your birth chart is not arbitrary but reflects real physical forces that shaped your formation.

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i006]` `[trigger: aethereal_power]` `[factor_trigger: astro_astro_regulation AND astro_tidal_effects]` `[role: 主干]` A certain power derived from the æthereal nature is diffused over and pervades the whole atmosphere of the earth. → Source Text I.2

- `[ns_tetra_i009]` `[trigger: moon_moisture]` `[factor_trigger: aspect_formation AND aspect_application]` `[role: 条件分支]` The Moon dispenses much influence; rivers, tides, plants and animals sympathize and vary with her waxing and waning. → Source Text I.2

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: The footnote (lines 1022-1058) preserves Peter Apianus's cosmological description (1574), showing how the ten-sphere model was standard until Copernicus. This contextualizes Ptolemy's physics within later reception.
- **中文**: 脚注（1022-1058行）保留了Peter Apianus的宇宙学描述（1574年），展示了十层天球模型在哥白尼之前是标准的。这将托勒密的物理学置于后来接受史的语境中。

### 3. That Prescience Is Useful (Chapter III)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1317-1571):
> It appears, then, that prescience by astronomy is possible under certain adaptation; and that alone it will afford premonition, as far as symptoms in the Ambient enable it to do so... First, however, let it be said in what respect and with what view it is proposed to draw advantage from this science; if it be considered in its tendency to promote the good of the mind, no object more advantageous can surely be wanting... In the next place, it must not be imagined that all things happen to mankind, as though every individual circumstance were ordained by divine decree and some indissoluble supernal cause; nor is it to be thought that all events are shown to proceed from one single inevitable fate... It is further to be remarked that man is subject, not only to events applicable to his own private and individual nature, but also to others arising from general causes. He suffers, for instance, by pestilences, inundations, or conflagrations, produced by certain extensive changes in the Ambient...

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Prescience**: πρόγνωσις - foreknowledge, predictive ability
- **Divine decree**: θεία ψῆφος - divine will, fate ordained by gods
- **Inevitable fate**: εἱμαρμένη - predetermined destiny, Stoic fate
- **Concurrent causes**: συναίτια - contributing factors alongside celestial influence
- **Medical Mathematics**: ἰατρομαθηματική - Egyptian term combining medicine and astrology

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy addresses the **utility of prescience** against two objections: (1) that astrology is impracticable, and (2) that it is useless because fate is inevitable. Against determinism, he argues that **not all events are ordained by divine decree or inevitable fate**—this would make precaution pointless. Instead, celestial influence operates through **natural causation** that can be modified by countermeasures.

He distinguishes **general causes** (affecting masses—pestilences, floods) from **particular causes** (affecting individuals). General causes are more powerful and harder to resist; particular causes can often be counteracted. This establishes a framework of **qualified determinism**: some events are inevitable (when causes are overwhelming), others are modifiable (when opposing forces exist).

The practical utility is twofold: (1) **Psychological preparation**—foreknowledge prevents shock from sudden events, allowing equanimity; (2) **Remedial action**—like medicine, astrology enables preventive measures. Ptolemy cites the **Egyptian "Medical Mathematics"** that combined astrological prognostication with medical intervention—using astronomical timing to optimize treatments.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密在此章回应关于**预知实用性**的两个反对意见：（1）占星学不可行；（2）占星学无用，因为命运不可避免。针对宿命论，他论证**并非所有事件都是神圣法令或不可避免的命运所注定的**——如果是这样，预防就毫无意义。相反，天体影响通过**自然因果**运作，可以通过对策加以修正。

他区分**普遍原因**（影响大众——瘟疫、洪水）与**个别原因**（影响个人）。普遍原因更强大，更难抵抗；个别原因通常可以被抵消。这建立了一个**有限定的决定论**框架：某些事件不可避免（当原因压倒性时），其他事件可以修正（当存在对抗力量时）。

实用价值有两方面：（1）**心理准备**——预知防止突发事件的震惊，允许保持平静；（2）**补救行动**——像医学一样，占星学能够采取预防措施。托勒密引用了埃及的**"医学数学"**，将占星预测与医疗干预相结合——利用天文时机优化治疗。

**Core Points**:
- Prescience is both practicable and useful
- Not all events are ordained by divine decree or inevitable fate
- Celestial influence operates through natural causation, not supernatural
- General causes (affecting masses) vs particular causes (affecting individuals)
- General causes are harder to resist; particular can be counteracted
- Qualified determinism: some events inevitable, others modifiable
- Psychological utility: foreknowledge enables equanimity
- Practical utility: enables preventive measures like medicine
- Egyptian "Medical Mathematics" combined astrology and medicine
- Antidotes can neutralize celestial influences just as they neutralize poisons

**Detailed Explanation**:
This chapter is philosophically crucial for understanding Ptolemaic astrology's relationship to fate and free will. Ptolemy rejects both extreme positions: (1) total determinism (everything fated, no point in precaution) and (2) total indeterminism (nothing predictable). Instead, he adopts a **moderate position**: celestial influences are real causal forces, but they operate within a system that includes other concurrent causes (species, place of birth, nurture, customs). This creates a space for human agency—while you cannot change your birth chart, you can respond to its indications through appropriate countermeasures.

The medical analogy is central: just as a physician predicts disease progression and prescribes remedies, an astrologer predicts life patterns and suggests mitigations. The Egyptian "Medical Mathematics" (iatromathematikē) represents the ideal integration—using precise astronomical timing to determine when treatments will be most effective.

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: The footnote on Samuel Hemmings (lines 1273-1283) provides a remarkable historical example of birth-time correlation (born same day as George III, with parallel life events). This illustrates the empirical claims underlying astrological theory.
- **中文**: 关于Samuel Hemmings的脚注（1273-1283行）提供了一个出生时间相关性的显著历史例子（与乔治三世同日出生，生活事件平行）。这说明了占星理论背后的经验主张。

## PART 2: Planetary Qualities (Chapters IV-VIII)

### 4. The Influences of the Planetary Orbs (Chapter IV)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1590-1638):
> The Sun is found to produce heat and moderate dryness. His magnitude, and the changes which he so evidently makes in the seasons, render his power more plainly perceptible than that of the other heavenly bodies; since his approach to the zenith of any part of the earth creates a greater degree of heat in that part and proportionately disposes its inhabitants after his own nature. The Moon principally generates moisture; her proximity to the earth renders her highly capable of exciting damp vapours, and of thus operating sensibly upon animal bodies by relaxation and putrefaction. She has, however, also a moderate share in the production of heat, in consequence of the illumination she receives from the Sun. Saturn produces cold and dryness, for he is most remote both from the Sun's heat and from the earth's vapours. But he is more effective in the production of cold than of dryness. Mars chiefly causes dryness, and is also strongly heating, by means of his own fiery nature, which is indicated by his colour, and in consequence of his vicinity to the Sun; the sphere of which is immediately below him. Jupiter revolves in an intermediate sphere between the extreme cold of Saturn and the burning heat of Mars, and has consequently a temperate influence: he therefore at once promotes both warmth and moisture. But, owing to the spheres of Mars and the Sun, which lie beneath him, his warmth is predominant: and hence he produces fertilizing breezes. To Venus also the same temperate quality belongs, although it exists conversely; since the heat she produces by her vicinity to the Sun is not so great as the moisture which she generates by the magnitude of her light, and by appropriating to herself the moist vapours of the earth, in the same manner that the Moon does. Mercury sometimes produces dryness, and at other times moisture, and each with equal vigour... he consequently operates rapid changes tending to produce alternately either quality.

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Heat/Cold**: θερμόν/ψυχρόν - primary active qualities in Aristotelian physics
- **Moist/Dry**: ὑγρόν/ξηρόν - primary passive qualities in Aristotelian physics
- **Temperate**: εὔκρατος - balanced mixture of qualities (Jupiter, Venus)
- **Fertilizing breezes**: γόνιμοι πνοαί - life-promoting atmospheric effects

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy assigns each planet specific **elemental qualities** based on Aristotelian physics (hot/cold, moist/dry). The assignments derive from observable effects (Sun's heat, Moon's effect on tides) and from celestial position (Saturn is cold because most remote from Sun).

**Planetary qualities**:
- **Sun**: Hot and moderately dry—observable through seasonal heating
- **Moon**: Primarily moist, moderately hot—affects tides, plant growth, bodily fluids
- **Saturn**: Cold and dry—most remote from Sun's heat and Earth's vapors; cold predominates
- **Mars**: Dry and very hot—fiery nature indicated by red color; near Sun's sphere
- **Jupiter**: Temperate (warm and moist)—between Saturn's cold and Mars's heat; warmth predominates, produces "fertilizing breezes"
- **Venus**: Temperate (moist and warm)—moisture predominates; absorbs Earth's vapors like Moon
- **Mercury**: Variable (moist or dry)—rapid motion produces alternating qualities

This establishes the **physiological basis** for planetary meanings: benefics (Jupiter, Venus) promote life through warmth and moisture; malefics (Saturn, Mars) harm through cold/dryness or excessive heat.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密根据亚里士多德物理学（热/冷、湿/干）为每颗行星分配特定的**元素属性**。这些分配源于可观察的效果（太阳的热、月亮对潮汐的影响）和天体位置（土星因离太阳最远而寒冷）。

**行星属性**：
- **太阳**：热且适度干燥——通过季节性加热可观察到
- **月亮**：主要是湿润，适度温热——影响潮汐、植物生长、体液
- **土星**：冷且干——离太阳热量和地球蒸汽最远；寒冷占主导
- **火星**：干且非常热——火性由红色表示；接近太阳天球
- **木星**：温和（温暖且湿润）——介于土星的寒冷和火星的炎热之间；温暖占主导，产生"滋养之风"
- **金星**：温和（湿润且温暖）——湿润占主导；像月亮一样吸收地球蒸汽
- **水星**：可变（湿润或干燥）——快速运动产生交替的属性

这建立了行星意义的**生理学基础**：吉星（木星、金星）通过温暖和湿润促进生命；凶星（土星、火星）通过寒冷/干燥或过热造成伤害。

**Core Points**:
- Sun: Hot and moderately dry—regulates seasons
- Moon: Primarily moist, moderately hot—governs fluids and growth
- Saturn: Cold and dry (cold predominates)—most remote from Sun
- Mars: Dry and very hot—fiery nature, red color
- Jupiter: Temperate (warm/moist, warmth predominates)—fertilizing
- Venus: Temperate (moist/warm, moisture predominates)—like Moon
- Mercury: Variable—alternates between moist and dry
- Qualities derive from position relative to Sun and Earth
- Aristotelian physics: hot/cold (active), moist/dry (passive)
- Basis for benefic/malefic distinction

### 5. Benefics and Malefics (Chapter V)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1646-1658):
> Of the four temperaments or qualities above mentioned, two are nutritive and prolific, viz. heat and moisture; by these all matter coalesces and is nourished: the other two are noxious and destructive, viz. dryness and cold; by these all matter is decayed and dissipated. Therefore, two of the planets, on account of their temperate quality, and because heat and moisture are predominant in them, are considered by the ancients as benefic, or causers of good: these are Jupiter and Venus. And the Moon also is so considered for the same reasons. But Saturn and Mars are esteemed of a contrary nature, and malefic, or causers of evil: the first from his excess of cold, the other from his excess of dryness.

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Benefic**: ἀγαθοποιός - doer of good, life-promoting planet
- **Malefic**: κακοποιός - doer of evil, life-harming planet
- **Nutritive**: τρόφιμος - nourishing, growth-promoting
- **Prolific**: γόνιμος - fertile, life-generating

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy derives the **benefic/malefic distinction** directly from planetary qualities. The logic is biological: **heat and moisture** are life-promoting (they allow matter to coalesce and grow); **cold and dryness** are life-harming (they cause decay and dissipation).

**Benefics** (Jupiter, Venus, Moon): Their temperate, warm-moist qualities promote growth and fertility.
**Malefics** (Saturn, Mars): Saturn's excessive cold and Mars's excessive dryness are destructive to life.

This is not moralistic good/evil but **physiological benefit/harm**. A benefic planet supports biological flourishing; a malefic disrupts it. The distinction has profound implications for chart interpretation: benefic planets in strong positions enhance life; malefic planets in affliction indicate obstacles and dangers.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密直接从行星属性推导出**吉/凶行星**的区分。逻辑是生物学的：**热和湿**促进生命（它们使物质凝聚和生长）；**冷和干**损害生命（它们导致衰败和消散）。

**吉星**（木星、金星、月亮）：它们温和、温暖湿润的属性促进生长和生育。
**凶星**（土星、火星）：土星的过度寒冷和火星的过度干燥对生命具有破坏性。

这不是道德上的善/恶，而是**生理上的有益/有害**。吉星支持生物繁荣；凶星干扰它。这一区分对命盘解读有深远影响：吉星在强位增强生命；凶星受克表示障碍和危险。

**Core Points**:
- Heat and moisture are nutritive and prolific—promote life
- Cold and dryness are noxious and destructive—harm life
- Benefics (Jupiter, Venus, Moon): Warm-moist, life-promoting
- Malefics (Saturn, Mars): Cold/dry or hot/dry, life-harming
- Distinction is physiological, not moralistic
- Sun and Mercury classified separately (luminaries/neutral)

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i024]` `[trigger: benefic_malefic_basis]` `[factor_trigger: planet_benefic AND life_promotion]` `[role: 主干]` Heat and moisture are nutritive; cold and dryness are destructive—this determines benefic vs malefic. → Source Text I.5
- `[ns_tetra_i025]` `[trigger: benefic_planets]` `[factor_trigger: planet_malefic AND life_harm]` `[role: 主干依赖]` Jupiter and Venus are benefic because heat and moisture predominate in their temperate quality. → Source Text I.5
- `[ns_tetra_i026]` `[trigger: malefic_planets]` `[factor_trigger: harmony_discord AND equal_power]` `[role: 主干依赖]` Saturn and Mars are malefic: Saturn from excess of cold, Mars from excess of dryness. → Source Text I.5

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: The Moon is included with benefics here, though later traditions sometimes treat her as neutral. The Sun is not explicitly classified in this chapter, consistent with his unique status as primary luminary.
- **中文**: 月亮在此被归入吉星，尽管后来的传统有时将她视为中性。太阳在本章中没有明确分类，与他作为主要发光体的独特地位一致。

### 6. Masculine and Feminine Planets (Chapter VI)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1670-1691):
> There are two primary sexes, male and female; and the female sex partakes chiefly of moisture. The Moon and Venus are therefore said to be feminine, since their qualities are principally moist. The Sun, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars are called masculine. Mercury is common to both genders, because at certain times he produces dryness, and at others moisture, and performs each in an equal ratio. The stars, however, are also said to be masculine and feminine, by their positions with regard to the Sun. While they are matutine and preceding the Sun, they are masculine; when vespertine and following the Sun, they become feminine. And they are further regulated in this respect by their positions with regard to the horizon. From the ascendant to the mid-heaven, or from the angle of the west to the lower heaven, they are considered to be masculine, being then oriental: and in the other two quadrants, feminine, being then occidental.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy assigns gender to planets based on elemental qualities: **moisture = feminine, dryness = masculine**. Moon and Venus are feminine (moist); Sun, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars are masculine (dry or hot). Mercury is hermaphroditic, alternating between qualities.

Beyond inherent nature, planets also acquire **situational gender** through:
1. **Position relative to Sun**: Matutine (rising before Sun) = masculine; Vespertine (setting after Sun) = feminine
2. **Position relative to horizon**: Eastern quadrants (ASC-MC, DSC-IC) = masculine/oriental; Western quadrants = feminine/occidental

This creates a dynamic system where a naturally feminine planet (Venus) can become masculinized by oriental position, and vice versa.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密根据元素属性为行星分配性别：**湿润=阴性，干燥=阳性**。月亮和金星是阴性的（湿润）；太阳、土星、木星、火星是阳性的（干燥或炎热）。水星是双性的，在两种属性之间交替。

除了固有本质外，行星还通过以下方式获得**情境性别**：
1. **相对于太阳的位置**：晨星（在太阳之前升起）=阳性；昏星（在太阳之后落下）=阴性
2. **相对于地平线的位置**：东方象限（上升-中天，下降-天底）=阳性/东方；西方象限=阴性/西方

这创造了一个动态系统，其中天生阴性的行星（金星）可以通过东方位置变得阳性化，反之亦然。

**Core Points**:
- Feminine = moist (Moon, Venus); Masculine = dry/hot (Sun, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars)
- Mercury is common to both genders (variable)
- Matutine position (before Sun) = masculine
- Vespertine position (after Sun) = feminine
- Eastern quadrants = masculine/oriental
- Western quadrants = feminine/occidental
- Gender is both inherent and situational

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i027]` `[trigger: planet_gender]` `[factor_trigger: sign_gender AND planet_oriental AND planet_masculine]` `[role: 主干]` Moon and Venus are feminine since their qualities are principally moist; Sun, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars are masculine. → Source Text I.6
- `[ns_tetra_i028]` `[trigger: mercury_dual]` `[factor_trigger: planet_position_sun AND lunar_phase]` `[role: 条件分支]` Mercury is common to both genders, producing dryness at certain times and moisture at others. → Source Text I.6
- `[ns_tetra_i029]` `[trigger: matutine_vespertine]` `[factor_trigger: no_relationship AND season_quality]` `[role: 条件分支]` Matutine and preceding the Sun = masculine; vespertine and following the Sun = feminine. → Source Text I.6

### 7. Diurnal and Nocturnal (Chapter VII)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1699-1725):
> The day and the night are the visible divisions of time. The day, in its heat and its aptitude for action, is masculine:—the night, in its moisture and its appropriation to rest, feminine. Hence, again, the Moon and Venus are esteemed to be nocturnal; the Sun and Jupiter, diurnal; and Mercury, common; since in his matutine position he is diurnal, but nocturnal when vespertine. Of the other two planets, Saturn and Mars, which are noxious, one is considered to be diurnal, and the other nocturnal. Neither of them, however, is allotted to that division of time with which its nature accords (as heat accords with heat), but each is disposed of on a contrary principle: and for this reason, that, although the benefit is increased when a favourable temperament receives an addition of its own nature, yet, the evil arising from a pernicious influence is much mitigated when dissimilar qualities are mingled with that influence. Hence the coldness of Saturn is allotted to the day, to counterbalance its heat; and the dryness of Mars to the night, to counterbalance its moisture.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy establishes the **sect** (αἵρεσις) doctrine—planets belong to either the day or night sect based on their qualities and the principle of **mitigation through opposition**.

**Sect assignments**:
- **Diurnal (Day sect)**: Sun, Jupiter, Saturn
- **Nocturnal (Night sect)**: Moon, Venus, Mars
- **Common**: Mercury (diurnal when matutine, nocturnal when vespertine)

The logic for benefics is straightforward: Sun and Jupiter (warm) belong to the warm day; Moon and Venus (moist) belong to the moist night. But malefics are assigned **contrarily** to mitigate their harm: Saturn (cold) is placed in the hot day to temper his coldness; Mars (dry/hot) is placed in the moist night to temper his dryness. This is a key principle: **similars strengthen, contraries temper**.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密建立了**派系**（αἵρεσις）教义——行星根据其属性和**通过对立缓和**的原则属于日派或夜派。

**派系分配**：
- **日间派（日派）**：太阳、木星、土星
- **夜间派（夜派）**：月亮、金星、火星
- **共同**：水星（晨星时为日间，昏星时为夜间）

吉星的逻辑很简单：太阳和木星（温暖）属于温暖的白天；月亮和金星（湿润）属于湿润的夜晚。但凶星被**相反地**分配以缓和其伤害：土星（寒冷）被置于炎热的白天以调和其寒冷；火星（干燥/炎热）被置于湿润的夜晚以调和其干燥。这是一个关键原则：**同类强化，对立调和**。

**Core Points**:
- Day = masculine, hot, active; Night = feminine, moist, restful
- Diurnal sect: Sun, Jupiter, Saturn
- Nocturnal sect: Moon, Venus, Mars
- Mercury is common (varies by position)
- Benefics assigned by affinity (similar strengthens)
- Malefics assigned contrarily (dissimilar tempers)
- Saturn (cold) → Day (hot) to mitigate
- Mars (dry) → Night (moist) to mitigate

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i030]` `[trigger: sect_doctrine]` `[factor_trigger: astro_planet_sect]` `[role: 主干]` Day is masculine and hot; night is feminine and moist—planets are assigned accordingly. → Source Text I.7
- `[ns_tetra_i031]` `[trigger: malefic_mitigation]` `[factor_trigger: astro_planet_saturn OR astro_planet_mars]` `[role: 主干]` Malefics are assigned contrarily: Saturn's cold to day's heat, Mars's dryness to night's moisture—to mitigate harm. → Source Text I.7

**Textual Criticism**: N/A: Sect doctrine is foundational and consistent.

### 8. Influence of Position with Regard to the Sun (Chapter VIII)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1733-1767):
> The respective powers of the Moon and of the three superior planets are either augmented or diminished by their several positions with regard to the Sun. The Moon, during her increase, from her first emerging to her first quarter, produces chiefly moisture; on continuing her increase from her first quarter to her full state of illumination, she causes heat; from her full state to her third quarter she causes dryness; and from her third quarter to her occultation she causes cold. The planets, when matutine, and from their first emerging until they arrive at their first station, are chiefly productive of moisture; from their first station until they rise at night, of heat; from their rising at night until their second station, of dryness; and from their second station until their occultation, they produce cold.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy describes how **planetary phase relative to Sun** modifies elemental qualities through a four-fold cycle.

**Moon's cycle** (synodic phases):
- New → 1st Quarter: Moisture (waxing crescent)
- 1st Quarter → Full: Heat (waxing gibbous)
- Full → 3rd Quarter: Dryness (waning gibbous)
- 3rd Quarter → New: Cold (waning crescent)

**Superior planets' cycle** (relative to Sun):
- Emergence → 1st Station: Moisture
- 1st Station → Opposition (night rising): Heat
- Opposition → 2nd Station: Dryness
- 2nd Station → Occultation: Cold

This creates a dynamic where the same planet expresses different qualities depending on its phase—a waxing Moon is moist/hot, a waning Moon is dry/cold. Configurations between planets further compound these variations.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密描述了**行星相对于太阳的位相**如何通过四重周期修改元素属性。

**月亮周期**（朔望周期）：
- 新月→上弦月：湿润（盈眉月）
- 上弦月→满月：炎热（盈凸月）
- 满月→下弦月：干燥（亏凸月）
- 下弦月→新月：寒冷（亏眉月）

**外行星周期**（相对于太阳）：
- 出现→第一次停滞：湿润
- 第一次停滞→冲（夜间升起）：炎热
- 冲→第二次停滞：干燥
- 第二次停滞→隐伏：寒冷

这创造了一种动态，同一颗行星根据其位相表达不同的属性——盈月是湿润/炎热的，亏月是干燥/寒冷的。行星之间的配置进一步复合这些变化。

**Core Points**:
- Moon's synodic cycle produces four elemental phases
- Superior planets follow parallel cycle based on Sun-position
- Waxing = moisture then heat; Waning = dryness then cold
- Phase modifies inherent planetary quality
- Configurations between planets create compound variations

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i032]` `[trigger: moon_phase_quality]` `[factor_trigger: astro_planet_moon AND astro_lunar_phase]` `[role: 主干]` Moon from new to first quarter produces moisture; first quarter to full, heat; full to third quarter, dryness; third quarter to new, cold. → Source Text I.8
- `[ns_tetra_i033]` `[trigger: planet_phase_quality]` `[factor_trigger: astro_planet_superior AND astro_sun_position]` `[role: 主干]` Superior planets: emergence to first station = moisture; to opposition = heat; to second station = dryness; to occultation = cold. → Source Text I.8

**Textual Criticism**: Footnote notes this applies strictly to superior planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn); Venus and Mercury have different cycles due to limited elongation.

### 9. The Fixed Stars (Chapter IX)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1774-1905):
> Next in succession, it is necessary to detail the natures and properties of the fixed stars; all of which have their respective influences, analogous to the influences of the planets... [Detailed listing of zodiacal stars by sign, with planetary nature attributions: e.g., "Aries: stars in the head possess influence similar to Mars and Saturn; those in the mouth act like Mercury..."; Aldebaran = Mars; Castor = Mercury; Pollux = Mars; Regulus = Mars and Jupiter; Spica = Venus and Mars; Antares = Mars and Jupiter; etc.]

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy catalogues the **fixed stars** by their planetary natures—each star or star group is assigned influence analogous to one or two planets. This establishes the basis for **parans** (stars rising/setting with chart points) and fixed star interpretation.

Key examples from the zodiacal constellations:
- **Aldebaran** (α Tauri, "the Follower"): Mars nature
- **Pleiades**: Moon and Mars
- **Castor** (α Geminorum): Mercury
- **Pollux** (β Geminorum): Mars
- **Præsepe** (Beehive cluster): Mars and Moon
- **Regulus** (α Leonis, "Cor Leonis"): Mars and Jupiter
- **Spica** (α Virginis): Venus and partly Mars
- **Antares** (α Scorpii, "Scorpion's Heart"): Mars and moderately Jupiter

The principle is that fixed stars, though they emit no independent "rays" (aspects), transmit influence when configured with planets or chart angles—especially when rising, culminating, or setting.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密按行星性质对**恒星**进行分类——每颗恒星或恒星群都被赋予类似于一颗或两颗行星的影响。这为**共升**（与星盘点位同升/同落的恒星）和恒星解读建立了基础。

来自黄道星座的关键例子：
- **毕宿五**（金牛座α，"追随者"）：火星性质
- **昴宿星团**：月亮和火星
- **北河二**（双子座α）：水星
- **北河三**（双子座β）：火星
- **鬼宿星团**（蜂巢星团）：火星和月亮
- **轩辕十四**（狮子座α，"狮心"）：火星和木星
- **角宿一**（室女座α）：金星，部分火星
- **心宿二**（天蝎座α，"蝎心"）：火星，适度木星

原则是恒星虽然不发出独立的"光线"（相位），但当与行星或星盘角度配置时——尤其是升起、中天或落下时——会传递影响。

**Core Points**:
- Fixed stars have planetary natures (analogous influence)
- Each zodiacal constellation's stars catalogued with planetary attributions
- Major stars: Aldebaran (Mars), Regulus (Mars/Jupiter), Spica (Venus/Mars), Antares (Mars/Jupiter)
- Stars operate through configuration with planets and angles
- Parans (co-rising, co-culminating) are primary mechanism
- Stars do not emit independent rays like planets

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i034]` `[trigger: fixed_star_nature]` `[factor_trigger: fixed_star AND astro_planet_qualities]` `[role: 主干]` Fixed stars have respective influences analogous to the planets—each star assigned planetary nature. → Source Text I.9
- `[ns_tetra_i035]` `[trigger: regulus_nature]` `[factor_trigger: astro_ambient_configuration AND concurrent_causes]` `[role: 条件分支]` Regulus, the bright one in the heart of Leo, agrees with Mars and Jupiter. → Source Text I.9
- `[ns_tetra_i036]` `[trigger: spica_nature]` `[factor_trigger: house_angle AND tropical_zodiac]` `[role: 条件分支]` Spica Virginis is like Venus and partly Mars. → Source Text I.9

**Textual Criticism**: Star names follow Greek/Arabic tradition; footnotes identify modern names (Aldebaran, Castor, Pollux, Regulus, Antares).

### 10. Constellations North of the Zodiac (Chapter X)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1907-1941):
> The constellations north of the zodiac have their respective influences, analogous to those of the planets, existing in the mode described in the following list.
> Ursa Minor: The bright stars are like Saturn, and in some degree like Venus.
> Ursa Major is like Mars, but the nebula under the tail resembles the Moon and Venus.
> Draco: The bright stars operate like Saturn and Mars.
> Cepheus is like Saturn and Jupiter.
> Bootes is like Mercury and Saturn; but Arcturus is like Mars and Jupiter.
> Corona Borealis is like Venus and Mercury.
> Hercules is like Mercury.
> Lyra is like Venus and Mercury.
> Cygnus is like Venus and Mercury.
> Cassiopeia is like Saturn and Venus.
> Perseus is like Jupiter and Saturn; the nebula in the sword is like Mars and Mercury.
> Auriga: The bright stars are like Mars and Mercury.
> Serpentarius is like Saturn, and moderately like Venus.
> Serpens is like Saturn and Mars.

> Aquila is like Mars and Jupiter.
> Delphinus is like Saturn and Mars.
> Equus (Pegasus): The bright stars are like Mars and Mercury.
> Andromeda is like Venus.
> Delta (Triangle) is like Mercury.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy catalogues the **northern constellations** (those above the zodiac band) by their planetary natures. Each constellation or its bright stars is assigned influence analogous to specific planets, enabling interpretation when these stars are configured with planets or chart points.

Key examples:
- **Ursa Minor/Major**: Saturn-Venus / Mars (with Moon-Venus nebula)
- **Draco**: Saturn-Mars (fierce, cold-dry)
- **Bootes/Arcturus**: Mercury-Saturn / Mars-Jupiter (Arcturus is especially powerful)
- **Lyra, Cygnus**: Venus-Mercury (artistic, communicative)
- **Aquila**: Mars-Jupiter (martial-regal)
- **Andromeda**: Pure Venus nature

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密按行星性质对**北黄道星座**（黄道带上方的星座）进行分类。每个星座或其亮星都被赋予类似于特定行星的影响，使这些恒星与行星或星盘点位配置时可以进行解读。

关键例子：
- **小熊座/大熊座**：土星-金星 / 火星（尾部星云类似月亮-金星）
- **天龙座**：土星-火星（凶猛、冷干）
- **牧夫座/大角星**：水星-土星 / 火星-木星（大角星尤其强力）
- **天琴座、天鹅座**：金星-水星（艺术性、沟通性）
- **天鹰座**：火星-木星（武勇-王者）
- **仙女座**：纯金星性质

**Core Points**:
- Northern constellations assigned planetary natures
- Each star/constellation has one or two planetary analogues
- Arcturus especially powerful (Mars-Jupiter)
- Stars influence when configured with planets/angles
- Foundation for paran and fixed star interpretation

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i070]` `[trigger: northern_stars]` `[factor_trigger: fixed_star_north AND sign_triplicity]` `[role: 主干]` Northern constellations have influences analogous to planets—Draco like Saturn-Mars, Arcturus like Mars-Jupiter. → Source Text I.10

### 11. Constellations South of the Zodiac (Chapter XI)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1943-1991):
> The influences of the constellations south of the zodiac, existing in a similar mode, are as follows:
> Piscis Australis: The bright star in the mouth (Fomalhaut) is of the same influence as Venus and Mercury.
> Cetus is like Saturn.
> Orion: The stars on the shoulders operate similarly to Mars and Mercury; other bright stars to Jupiter and Saturn.
> Fluvius (Eridanus): The last bright one is like Jupiter; the rest are like Saturn.
> Lepus is like Saturn and Mercury.
> Canis: The bright star in the mouth (Sirius) is like Jupiter, and partly like Mars; the others are like Venus.
> Procyon (Canis Minor): The bright star is like Mercury, and in some degree like Mars.
> Hydrus: The bright stars are like Saturn and Venus.
> Crater is like Venus, and in some degree like Mercury.
> Corvus is like Mars and Saturn.
> Argo is like Saturn and Jupiter.
> Centaurus: The human part is like Venus and Mercury; the horse part like Venus and Jupiter.
> Lupus: The bright stars are like Saturn, and partly like Mars.
> Ara is like Venus, and also Mercury in some degree.
> Corona Australis: The bright stars are like Saturn and Jupiter.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy catalogues the **southern constellations** (below the zodiac) by planetary natures:

Key examples:
- **Fomalhaut** (α Piscis Australis): Venus-Mercury—the "Royal Star" of the south
- **Sirius** (α Canis Majoris): Jupiter-Mars—the brightest fixed star, powerful for fame and honor
- **Orion**: Mixed—shoulders Mars-Mercury, body Jupiter-Saturn
- **Centaurus**: Human part Venus-Mercury, horse part Venus-Jupiter

The footnote notes that stars emit no independent rays but gain power through: (1) proximity to ecliptic, (2) northern position, (3) zenith passage, (4) conjunction with planets, or (5) rising/setting/culminating with planets.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密按行星性质对**南黄道星座**（黄道以下）进行分类：

关键例子：
- **北落师门**（南鱼座α）：金星-水星——南方"王者恒星"
- **天狼星**（大犬座α）：木星-火星——最亮的恒星，对名誉和荣誉有强力
- **猎户座**：混合——肩部火星-水星，躯体木星-土星
- **半人马座**：人体部分金星-水星，马体部分金星-木星

脚注指出恒星不发射独立光线，但通过以下方式获得力量：(1) 靠近黄道，(2) 北方位置，(3) 过天顶，(4) 与行星合相，或 (5) 与行星同升/同落/同中天。

**Core Points**:
- Southern constellations assigned planetary natures
- Sirius (Dog Star) = Jupiter-Mars, most powerful fixed star
- Fomalhaut = Venus-Mercury, southern Royal Star
- Stars gain power through configuration with planets and angles
- Stars emit no independent rays—influence through paran

### 12. The Annual Seasons (Chapter XII)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1999-2035):
> The year comprises four seasons; spring, summer, autumn, and winter; of these, the spring partakes chiefly of moisture, for on the dissipation of cold and recommencement of warmth, an expansion of the fluids takes place: the summer is principally hot, owing to the Sun's nearest approach to the zenith: the autumn is principally dry, because the recent heat has absorbed the moisture: and the winter is chiefly cold, the Sun being then at his farthest distance from the zenith. The beginning of the whole zodiacal circle is therefore assumed to be the sign of Aries, which commences at the vernal equinox: since the moisture of spring forms a primary beginning in the zodiac, analogous to the beginning of all animal life, which, in its first age of existence, abounds principally in moisture...

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy establishes the **seasonal-zodiacal correspondence**:
- **Spring** (Aries) = Moist—fluids expand as cold dissipates
- **Summer** (Cancer) = Hot—Sun nearest zenith
- **Autumn** (Libra) = Dry—heat has absorbed moisture
- **Winter** (Capricorn) = Cold—Sun farthest from zenith

This explains why **Aries is the zodiacal beginning**: spring's moisture parallels the moisture of new life. The seasons also correspond to **ages of life**: Spring = infancy (moist), Summer = prime (hot), Autumn = decline (dry), Winter = old age (cold).

Crucially, the footnote (lines 2023-2035) addresses the "precession objection"—Ptolemy explicitly defines signs by the **tropical points** (equinoxes/solstices), not fixed stars. The "sign of Aries" means "the 30° after the vernal equinox," regardless of which constellation occupies that space.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密建立了**季节-黄道对应**：
- **春季**（白羊座）= 湿润——随着寒冷消散，液体扩张
- **夏季**（巨蟹座）= 炎热——太阳最接近天顶
- **秋季**（天秤座）= 干燥——热量已吸收水分
- **冬季**（摩羯座）= 寒冷——太阳离天顶最远

这解释了为什么**白羊座是黄道的起点**：春天的湿润与新生命的湿润平行。季节也对应**人生阶段**：春季=婴儿期（湿润），夏季=壮年（炎热），秋季=衰退（干燥），冬季=老年（寒冷）。

关键地，脚注（2023-2035行）解答了"岁差反对意见"——托勒密明确按**回归点**（春分/秋分）定义星座，而非恒星。"白羊座"意为"春分后的30°"，无论哪个星座占据该空间。

**Core Points**:
- Spring = moist, Summer = hot, Autumn = dry, Winter = cold
- Aries begins zodiac because spring's moisture = beginning of life
- Seasons correspond to ages: infancy-prime-decline-old age
- Signs defined by tropical points, not fixed stars
- Precession does not invalidate astrological signs

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i037]` `[trigger: seasonal_quality]` `[factor_trigger: astro_season_quality]` `[role: 主干]` Spring is moist, summer hot, autumn dry, winter cold—corresponding to the four zodiacal quadrants. → Source Text I.12
- `[ns_tetra_i038]` `[trigger: aries_beginning]` `[factor_trigger: astro_sign_aries]` `[role: 主干依赖]` Aries commences at the vernal equinox because spring's moisture forms the primary beginning, analogous to animal life. → Source Text I.12

### 13. The Four Angles (Chapter XIII)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2043-2084):
> The angles are the four cardinal points of the horizon... the eastern point, or angle of the ascendant, is chiefly dry in its nature; because, on the Sun's arrival therein, the damps occasioned by the night begin to be dried up... The southern point, or angle of the mid-heaven, is the most hot... The western point, or occidental angle, is moist; because, when the Sun is there, the moisture, which had been overpowered during the day, recommences its operation... The northern point, or angle of the lower heaven, is the most cold...

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy assigns elemental qualities to the **four angles**:
- **Ascendant (East)**: Dry—sunrise dries nocturnal moisture
- **Midheaven (South)**: Hot—Sun at meridian, maximum heat
- **Descendant (West)**: Moist—sunset allows moisture to return
- **IC (North)**: Cold—midnight, maximum cold

This creates a framework where angular placement modifies planetary expression by adding the angle's quality to the planet's inherent quality. Stars are stronger when their quality matches the angle's quality (fire planet at MC), weaker when contrary (fire planet at IC).

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密为**四角**分配元素属性：
- **上升点（东）**：干燥——日出干燥夜间湿气
- **中天（南）**：炎热——太阳在子午线，最大热量
- **下降点（西）**：湿润——日落允许湿气返回
- **天底（北）**：寒冷——午夜，最大寒冷

这创造了一个框架，其中角度位置通过将角度的属性添加到行星的固有属性来修改行星表达。当行星的属性与角度的属性匹配时（火性行星在中天），更强；当相反时（火性行星在天底），更弱。

**Core Points**:
- Ascendant = Dry (sunrise dries damp)
- Midheaven = Hot (Sun at meridian)
- Descendant = Moist (sunset releases moisture)
- IC = Cold (midnight)
- Angular quality modifies planetary expression
- Matching qualities strengthen; contrary qualities weaken

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i040]` `[trigger: angle_quality]` `[factor_trigger: astro_house_angle AND angle_quality]` `[role: 主干]` The four angles have distinct qualities: Ascendant is dry, Midheaven hot, Descendant moist, IC cold. → Source Text I.13

### 14. Tropical, Equinoctial, Fixed, and Bicorporeal Signs (Chapter XIV)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2102-2134):
> Among the twelve signs, some are termed tropical, others equinoctial, others fixed, and others bicorporeal. The tropical signs are two: Cancer and Capricorn... called tropical because the Sun seems to turn... The equinoctial signs are Aries and Libra... The remaining eight signs: four are fixed (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) and four bicorporeal (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces).

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy classifies signs by their **relationship to seasonal turning points**:

- **Tropical signs** (Cancer, Capricorn): At solstices where Sun "turns" (τρέπω)
- **Equinoctial signs** (Aries, Libra): At equinoxes where day/night equal
- **Fixed signs** (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius): Follow tropical/equinoctial; season is "fixed" and established
- **Bicorporeal/Mutable signs** (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces): Between fixed and tropical; participate in both preceding and following season

This creates the **quadruplicity** system (Cardinal/Fixed/Mutable) still used in modern astrology.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密按其**与季节转折点的关系**对星座进行分类：

- **回归星座**（巨蟹座、摩羯座）：在太阳"转向"（τρέπω）的至点
- **分点星座**（白羊座、天秤座）：在昼夜等长的分点
- **固定星座**（金牛座、狮子座、天蝎座、水瓶座）：跟随回归/分点；季节"固定"并确立
- **双体/变动星座**（双子座、室女座、射手座、双鱼座）：介于固定和回归之间；参与前后两个季节

这创造了现代占星学仍在使用的**四分性**系统（本位/固定/变动）。

**Core Points**:
- Tropical (Cardinal): Cancer, Capricorn—at solstices, initiate change
- Equinoctial (Cardinal): Aries, Libra—at equinoxes, initiate change
- Fixed: Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius—establish and stabilize season
- Bicorporeal (Mutable): Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces—transition between seasons

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i042]` `[trigger: sign_modality]` `[factor_trigger: astro_sign_modality]` `[role: 主干]` Signs are tropical, equinoctial, fixed, or bicorporeal based on relationship to seasonal turning points. → Source Text I.14
- `[ns_tetra_i043]` `[trigger: fixed_signs]` `[factor_trigger: astro_sign_fixed]` `[role: 条件分支]` Fixed signs follow tropical/equinoctial; the season is then firmly established. → Source Text I.14

### 15. Masculine and Feminine Signs (Chapter XV)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2137-2180):
> Among the twelve signs, six are called masculine and diurnal, and six feminine and nocturnal. They are arranged in alternate order, one after the other, as the day is followed by the night, and as the male is coupled with the female. The commencement belongs to Aries; since the moisture of spring forms an introduction for the other seasons. And, as the male sex governs, and the active principle takes precedence of the passive, the signs of Aries and Libra are consequently considered to be masculine and diurnal. The signs immediately following them are feminine and nocturnal; and the rest are consecutively arranged as masculine and feminine, by alternate order.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy assigns **gender to signs** in alternating pattern starting from Aries:
- **Masculine/Diurnal signs**: Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius (odd signs)
- **Feminine/Nocturnal signs**: Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, Pisces (even signs)

The rationale: Aries is masculine because (1) it begins the zodiac at spring, (2) the active/masculine principle precedes the passive/feminine. Signs alternate thereafter.

Alternative methods exist: some astrologers assign gender based on (1) the ascending sign, or (2) quadrant position (oriental quadrants = masculine, occidental = feminine).

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密以从白羊座开始的交替模式为**星座分配性别**：
- **阳性/昼间星座**：白羊座、双子座、狮子座、天秤座、射手座、水瓶座（奇数星座）
- **阴性/夜间星座**：金牛座、巨蟹座、室女座、天蝎座、摩羯座、双鱼座（偶数星座）

理由：白羊座是阳性的因为(1)它在春季开始黄道，(2)主动/阳性原则先于被动/阴性。此后星座交替。

存在替代方法：一些占星家根据(1)上升星座，或(2)象限位置（东方象限=阳性，西方=阴性）分配性别。

**Core Points**:
- Signs alternate masculine/feminine starting from Aries
- Masculine = active, diurnal; Feminine = passive, nocturnal
- Aries is masculine as zodiacal beginning and spring initiator
- Alternative systems exist (quadrant-based)

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i073]` `[trigger: sign_gender]` `[factor_trigger: astro_sign_masculine OR astro_sign_feminine]` `[role: 主干]` Signs are alternately masculine and feminine, starting from masculine Aries. → Source Text I.15

### 16. Aspects and Configurations (Chapter XVI)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2188-2252):
> There are certain familiarities or connections between different parts of the zodiac... This mutual configuration attaches to all parts diametrically distant from each other, containing between them two right angles, or six signs, or a hundred and eighty degrees [opposition]: it also exists in all parts at the triangular distance [trine, 120°]... at the quadrate distance [square, 90°]... and at the hexagonal distance [sextile, 60°]... Of these configurations, the trine and the sextile are each called harmonious, because they are constituted between signs of the same kind; being formed between either all feminine or all masculine signs. The opposition and quartile are considered to be discordant, because they are configurations made between signs not of the same kind, but of different natures and sexes.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy defines the **four major aspects** by geometric division of the circle:
- **Opposition** (180°, 6 signs): Diameter—maximum separation
- **Trine** (120°, 4 signs): Equilateral triangle—harmonious
- **Square** (90°, 3 signs): Right angle—discordant
- **Sextile** (60°, 2 signs): Hexagon—harmonious

The distinction between **harmonious** (trine, sextile) and **discordant** (square, opposition) aspects is based on **sign gender**: trines and sextiles connect signs of the same gender (all masculine or all feminine); squares and oppositions connect signs of different genders.

The conjunction is notably absent from this chapter because it involves parts in the same place, not configurated "with each other" at a distance.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密通过圆的几何划分定义**四大相位**：
- **对冲**（180°，6个星座）：直径——最大分离
- **三分**（120°，4个星座）：等边三角形——和谐
- **四分**（90°，3个星座）：直角——不和谐
- **六分**（60°，2个星座）：六边形——和谐

**和谐**（三分、六分）与**不和谐**（四分、对冲）相位的区分基于**星座性别**：三分和六分连接相同性别的星座（都是阳性或都是阴性）；四分和对冲连接不同性别的星座。

合相在本章中明显缺席，因为它涉及同一位置的部分，而不是在远处"彼此"配置。

**Core Points**:
- Opposition (180°): Maximum tension, discordant
- Trine (120°): Flowing harmony, same-gender signs
- Square (90°): Dynamic tension, different-gender signs
- Sextile (60°): Gentle harmony, same-gender signs
- Aspect quality derived from sign gender compatibility
- Conjunction not listed (same place, not configurated)

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i044]` `[trigger: aspect_definition]` `[factor_trigger: astro_aspect_type]` `[role: 主干]` Aspects are determined by geometric division: opposition (180°), trine (120°), square (90°), sextile (60°). → Source Text I.16

### 17. Signs Commanding and Obeying (Chapter XVII)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2255-2268):
> Any two signs configurated with each other at an equal distance from the same, or from either equinoctial point, are termed commanding and obeying, because the ascensional and descensional times of the one are equal to those of the other, and both describe equal parallels. The signs in the summer semicircle are commanding; those in the winter semicircle, obeying: for, when the Sun is present in the former, he makes the day longer than the night; and, when in the latter, he produces the contrary effect.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy defines **commanding and obeying signs**—pairs equidistant from an equinoctial point:
- **Commanding signs** (summer semicircle: Aries-Virgo): When Sun is here, days are longer
- **Obeying signs** (winter semicircle: Libra-Pisces): When Sun is here, nights are longer

This creates antiscia-like pairs (Aries-Virgo, Taurus-Leo, Gemini-Cancer / Libra-Pisces, Scorpio-Aquarius, Sagittarius-Capricorn) with equal ascensional times.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密定义了**命令与服从星座**——与分点等距的星座对：
- **命令星座**（夏季半圆：白羊座-室女座）：太阳在此时，白昼更长
- **服从星座**（冬季半圆：天秤座-双鱼座）：太阳在此时，黑夜更长

这创造了类似反映点的配对，具有相等的上升时间。

**Core Points**:
- Commanding = summer signs (longer days)
- Obeying = winter signs (longer nights)
- Pairs equidistant from equinoxes
- Related to ascensional times

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i074]` `[trigger: commanding_obeying]` `[factor_trigger: astro_sign_commanding AND sign_command_obey]` `[role: 主干]` Summer signs command, winter signs obey—based on day/night length. → Source Text I.17

### 18. Signs Beholding Each Other (Chapter XVIII)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2271-2292):
> Any two signs, equally distant from either tropical sign, are equal to each other in power; because the Sun, when present in one, makes day and night, and the divisions of time, respectively equal in duration to those which he produces when present in the other. Such signs are also said to behold each other, as well for the foregoing reasons, as because each of them rises from one and the same part of the horizon, and sets in one and the same part.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy defines **signs beholding each other (antiscia)**—pairs equidistant from a solstice point:
- Signs at equal distance from Cancer/Capricorn have **equal power**
- They rise and set at the same horizon points
- Examples: Gemini-Leo, Taurus-Virgo, Aries-Libra (but these also have other relationships)

This is distinct from commanding/obeying (which uses equinoxes as reference).

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密定义了**互视星座（反映点）**——与至点等距的星座对：
- 与巨蟹座/摩羯座等距的星座具有**相等的力量**
- 它们从同一地平线位置升起和落下
- 例子：双子座-狮子座，金牛座-室女座

这与命令/服从不同（后者以分点为参考）。

**Core Points**:
- Signs equidistant from solstices behold each other
- Equal power (same day/night duration)
- Rise and set at same horizon points
- Antiscia relationship

**Narrative Snippets**:

### 19. Signs Inconjunct (Chapter XIX)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2295-2320):
> All signs, between which there does not exist any familiarity in any of the modes above specified, are inconjunct and separated. For instance, all signs are inconjunct which are neither commanding nor obeying, and not beholding each other nor of equal power, as well as all signs which contain between them the space of one sign only, or the space of five signs, and which do not at all share in any of the four prescribed configurations.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy defines **inconjunct signs** (aversion, ἀσύνδετα)—signs with NO relationship:
- Not commanding/obeying
- Not beholding each other
- Not in aspect (opposition, trine, square, sextile)
- Specifically: **semi-sextile** (30°, one sign apart) and **quincunx** (150°, five signs apart)

These are the only angular distances that share no aspect, no antiscia, no commanding/obeying relationship. They are "blind" to each other.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密定义了**不合星座**（背离，ἀσύνδετα）——没有任何关系的星座：
- 非命令/服从
- 非互视
- 无相位（对冲、三分、四分、六分）
- 具体来说：**半六分**（30°，相隔一个星座）和**梅花相**（150°，相隔五个星座）

这些是唯一不共享任何相位、反映点、命令/服从关系的角度距离。它们彼此"看不见"。

**Core Points**:
- Inconjunct = no familiarity in any mode
- Semi-sextile (30°) and Quincunx (150°) are inconjunct
- These signs are "blind" to each other
- No aspect, no antiscia, no command/obey

**Narrative Snippets**:

### 20. Houses of the Planets (Chapter XX)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2373-2432):
> Those stars which are denominated planetary orbs have particular familiarity with certain places in the zodiac, by means of parts designated as their houses... Cancer and Leo are the most northerly of all the twelve signs; they approach nearer than the other signs to the zenith of this part of the earth, and thereby cause warmth and heat: they are consequently appropriated as houses for the two principal luminaries; Leo for the Sun, and Cancer for the Moon. Saturn occupies the signs opposite to Cancer and Leo: Aquarius and Capricorn... Jupiter occupies Sagittarius and Pisces... Mars takes Aries and Scorpio... Venus takes Taurus and Libra... Mercury takes Gemini and Virgo.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy explains the **domicile (house) system**—each planet rules two signs (except luminaries, which rule one each):

- **Sun**: Leo (masculine, most northerly = warmest)
- **Moon**: Cancer (feminine, nearest Sun's house)
- **Saturn**: Capricorn, Aquarius (opposite luminaries = cold/wintry)
- **Jupiter**: Sagittarius, Pisces (trine to luminaries = harmonious)
- **Mars**: Aries, Scorpio (square to luminaries = discordant)
- **Venus**: Taurus, Libra (sextile to luminaries = harmonious)
- **Mercury**: Gemini, Virgo (adjacent to luminaries = nearest)

The logic is elegant: Cancer/Leo are assigned to Moon/Sun because they're the northernmost (warmest) signs. Other planets are distributed by aspect relationship to these houses and by orbital position (Saturn most remote = opposite; Mercury closest = adjacent).

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密解释了**庙旺（主宰）系统**——每颗行星主宰两个星座（发光体除外，各主宰一个）：

- **太阳**：狮子座（阳性，最北=最温暖）
- **月亮**：巨蟹座（阴性，最接近太阳的宫位）
- **土星**：摩羯座、水瓶座（与发光体相对=寒冷/冬季）
- **木星**：射手座、双鱼座（与发光体三分=和谐）
- **火星**：白羊座、天蝎座（与发光体四分=不和谐）
- **金星**：金牛座、天秤座（与发光体六分=和谐）
- **水星**：双子座、室女座（与发光体相邻=最近）

逻辑很优雅：巨蟹座/狮子座被分配给月亮/太阳，因为它们是最北（最温暖）的星座。其他行星按与这些宫位的相位关系和轨道位置分布（土星最远=对面；水星最近=相邻）。

**Core Points**:
- Sun rules Leo; Moon rules Cancer (warmest signs)
- Saturn rules Capricorn, Aquarius (opposite luminaries)
- Jupiter rules Sagittarius, Pisces (trine luminaries)
- Mars rules Aries, Scorpio (square luminaries)
- Venus rules Taurus, Libra (sextile luminaries)
- Mercury rules Gemini, Virgo (adjacent luminaries)
- Distribution follows aspect geometry and orbital sequence

### 21. The Triplicities (Chapter XXI)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2440-2457):
> The triplicity preserves accordance with an equilateral triangle, and the whole zodiacal orbit is defined by three circles... The first triangle, or triplicity, is formed by three masculine signs, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, having the Sun, Jupiter, and Mars as lords by house. Mars, however, being contrary in condition to the solar influence, this triplicity receives, as its lords, only Jupiter and the Sun. By day, therefore, the Sun claims the principal co-regency of it, and Jupiter by night.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy explains the **triplicity (elemental) system**:

- **Fire triplicity** (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius): Masculine, Sun and Jupiter as lords (Sun by day, Jupiter by night)—Mars excluded due to contrary nature
- **Earth triplicity** (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn): Feminine, Venus and Moon as lords
- **Air triplicity** (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius): Masculine, Saturn and Mercury as lords
- **Water triplicity** (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces): Feminine, Mars and Moon as lords

Each triplicity has a **day lord** and **night lord**—the day lord takes precedence in day charts, the night lord in night charts. This is the basis for **triplicity dignities** in traditional astrology.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密解释了**三分性（元素）系统**：

- **火象三分性**（白羊座、狮子座、射手座）：阳性，太阳和木星为主星（白天太阳，夜间木星）——火星因性质相反被排除
- **土象三分性**（金牛座、室女座、摩羯座）：阴性，金星和月亮为主星
- **风象三分性**（双子座、天秤座、水瓶座）：阳性，土星和水星为主星
- **水象三分性**（巨蟹座、天蝎座、双鱼座）：阴性，火星和月亮为主星

每个三分性都有一个**日间主星**和**夜间主星**——日间主星在日盘中优先，夜间主星在夜盘中优先。这是传统占星学中**三分性尊贵**的基础。

**Core Points**:
- Fire (Aries/Leo/Sagittarius): Sun (day), Jupiter (night)
- Earth (Taurus/Virgo/Capricorn): Venus (day), Moon (night)
- Air (Gemini/Libra/Aquarius): Saturn (day), Mercury (night)
- Water (Cancer/Scorpio/Pisces): Mars (day), Moon (night)
- Day/night lords take precedence based on chart sect

**Narrative Snippets**:

### 22. Exaltations (Chapter XXII)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2512-2553):
> The Sun on his entrance into Aries is then passing into the higher and more northern semicircle; his exaltation, therefore, is determined to be in Aries, his fall in Libra. Saturn on the contrary, in order to preserve his station opposite to the Sun, obtains his exaltation in Libra, and his fall in Aries. The Moon, after conjunction with the Sun in Aries, makes her first appearance and begins to augment her light in Taurus, which is consequently her exaltation; Scorpio is her fall. Jupiter becomes most northerly and augments his peculiar influence when in Cancer—his exaltation; Capricorn is his fall. Mars possesses a fiery nature receiving greatest intensity in Capricorn—his exaltation; Cancer is his fall. Venus is chiefly moist when in Pisces—her exaltation; Virgo is her fall. Mercury, of a nature opposite to Venus, takes his exaltation in Virgo; Pisces is his fall.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy explains the **exaltation (ὕψωμα)** system—each planet has a sign where its influence is maximally intensified, and an opposite sign of "fall" where it is weakened:

| Planet | Exaltation | Fall | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|------|-----------|
| Sun | Aries | Libra | Enters northern hemisphere, days lengthen |
| Saturn | Libra | Aries | Opposite Sun (cold opposes heat) |
| Moon | Taurus | Scorpio | First visible after Sun's exaltation |
| Jupiter | Cancer | Capricorn | Most northerly, fertilizing influence max |
| Mars | Capricorn | Cancer | Fiery nature intensified in south |
| Venus | Pisces | Virgo | Moisture peaks in watery sign |
| Mercury | Virgo | Pisces | Autumnal dryness (opposite Venus) |

The exaltation degrees (not specified here but traditional: Sun 19° Aries, Moon 3° Taurus, etc.) mark the exact point of maximum dignity.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密解释了**擢升/耀升（ὕψωμα）**系统——每颗行星都有一个星座其影响力最大化，以及一个相对的"落陷"星座其影响力减弱：

| 行星 | 擢升 | 落陷 | 理由 |
|------|------|------|------|
| 太阳 | 白羊座 | 天秤座 | 进入北半球，白昼延长 |
| 土星 | 天秤座 | 白羊座 | 与太阳相对（寒冷对抗热量） |
| 月亮 | 金牛座 | 天蝎座 | 太阳擢升后首次可见 |
| 木星 | 巨蟹座 | 摩羯座 | 最北，滋养影响最大 |
| 火星 | 摩羯座 | 巨蟹座 | 火性在南方强化 |
| 金星 | 双鱼座 | 室女座 | 湿润在水象星座达到顶峰 |
| 水星 | 室女座 | 双鱼座 | 秋季干燥（与金星相对） |

**Core Points**:
- Exaltation = sign of maximum planetary influence
- Fall = opposite sign, minimum influence
- Sun exalted Aries (spring, days lengthen)
- Saturn exalted Libra (opposite Sun)
- Moon exalted Taurus (first light after Sun's exaltation)
- Jupiter exalted Cancer (northernmost, fertile)
- Mars exalted Capricorn (fire intensified south)
- Venus exalted Pisces (moisture maximum)
- Mercury exalted Virgo (dryness, opposite Venus)

**Narrative Snippets**:

### 23. The Disposition of the Terms - Egyptian System (Chapter XXIII)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2556-2712):
> There are two methods of disposing the terms of the planets: one is Ægyptian, and the other Chaldaic, or according to the order of the Decans... The Ægyptian method observes neither regular succession, nor any discernible ratio; and is as follows [tables follow]... Jupiter 79°, Mars 66°, Venus 82°, Mercury 76°, Saturn 57°. These are the Ægyptian terms.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
**Egyptian Terms** represent the traditional system for dividing each sign into five unequal planetary segments:

**Structure**: Each 30° sign is divided into 5 portions, each ruled by one of the five non-luminary planets (Sun/Moon excluded).

**Egyptian allocation totals**:
- Jupiter: 79° (most benefic = largest share)
- Venus: 82° (second benefic)
- Mercury: 76° (neutral)
- Mars: 66° (lesser malefic)
- Saturn: 57° (greater malefic = smallest share)

**Ptolemy's critique**: The Egyptian system lacks consistent rationale—no clear mathematical or astronomical basis for the irregular distributions.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**埃及界**代表将每个星座分成五个不等行星部分的传统系统：

**结构**：每个30°星座被分成5份，每份由五颗非发光体行星之一主宰（太阳/月亮除外）。

**埃及分配总数**：
- 木星：79°（最大吉星 = 最大份额）
- 金星：82°（第二吉星）
- 水星：76°（中性）
- 火星：66°（小凶星）
- 土星：57°（大凶星 = 最小份额）

**托勒密的批评**：埃及系统缺乏一致的理据——不规则分布没有明确的数学或天文基础。

**Core Points**:
- Terms = minor essential dignity
- Each sign divided into 5 unequal segments
- Only 5 planets participate (luminaries excluded)
- Egyptian system: Traditional but irregular
- Benefics receive more degrees than malefics
- Total = 360° across entire zodiac

**Narrative Snippets**:

### 24. The Terms According to Ptolemy (Chapter XXIV)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2714-2802):
> The foregoing terms are disposed agreeably to the Ægyptian method; which, however, is neither consonant with order, nor with any assignment of a substantial reason. But the terms according to the Chaldaic mode, which observes a connected order and arrangement by decans, are more worthy of regard... Nevertheless, there is still another method, founded on a plausible system, and entitled to credit on account of its connection with the natures of the stars, and their qualities of domination.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
**Ptolemaic Terms** represent Ptolemy's reformed system based on rational dignity principles:

**Ptolemy's method**:
1. Count dignities each planet holds in a sign (domicile, exaltation, triplicity)
2. Planets with most dignities receive first/largest portions
3. Default allocations: Benefics 7°, Malefics 5°, Mercury 6°
4. Order within sign follows dignity count, then natural order

**Rationale**: Unlike Egyptian system, Ptolemaic terms have consistent mathematical basis—allocations derive from measurable dignities.

**Historical note**: Despite Ptolemy's preference for his own system, medieval and Renaissance astrologers often retained Egyptian terms, viewing them as having ancient authority.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**托勒密界**代表托勒密基于理性尊贵原则的改革系统：

**托勒密的方法**：
1. 计算每颗行星在星座中持有的尊贵（庙旺、曜升、三分）
2. 拥有最多尊贵的行星获得第一/最大份额
3. 默认分配：吉星7°，凶星5°，水星6°
4. 星座内顺序遵循尊贵计数，然后是自然顺序

**理据**：与埃及系统不同，托勒密界有一致的数学基础——分配源于可测量的尊贵。

**历史注释**：尽管托勒密偏好自己的系统，中世纪和文艺复兴时期的占星家常保留埃及界，视其具有古老权威。

**Core Points**:
- Ptolemaic system based on dignity count
- Benefics (Jupiter, Venus) receive 7° default
- Malefics (Saturn, Mars) receive 5° default
- Mercury receives 6° default
- Order determined by dignity hierarchy
- More rational than Egyptian system

### 25. Tropical vs Sidereal Zodiac Defense (Chapter XXV)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2825-2837):
> The beginnings of the signs, and likewise those of the terms, are to be taken from the equinoctial and tropical points. This rule is not only clearly stated by writers on the subject, but is also especially evident by the demonstration constantly afforded, that their natures, influences and familiarities have no other origin than from the tropics and equinoxes... And, if other beginnings were allowed, it would either be necessary to exclude the natures of the signs from the theory of prognostication, or impossible to avoid error.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy makes an **explicit defense of the tropical zodiac**: sign beginnings must be measured from the **equinoctial and tropical points** (vernal equinox = 0° Aries), not from fixed star positions. The rationale is that sign natures derive from their relationship to seasons and solstices—Aries is moist because it begins spring, not because of any particular stars.

This passage directly addresses the **precession objection**: even though the constellation Aries has drifted from the vernal equinox, the *sign* of Aries (defined as "30° after vernal equinox") retains its meaning. Using any other starting point would either invalidate sign meanings or produce errors.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密**明确为回归黄道辩护**：星座起点必须从**分至点**（春分点 = 白羊座0°）测量，而不是从恒星位置。理由是星座性质源于它们与季节和至点的关系——白羊座是湿润的因为它开始春天，而非因为任何特定恒星。

这段话直接回应了**岁差反对意见**：即使白羊座星群已经从春分点漂移，白羊座*星座*（定义为"春分后30°"）仍保留其意义。使用任何其他起点要么会使星座意义无效，要么会产生错误。

**Core Points**:
- Signs begin from equinoctial/tropical points, not fixed stars
- This is the definitive statement for tropical zodiac
- Sign natures derive from seasonal relationship
- Precession does not invalidate tropical signs
- Using sidereal starting points would cause errors
- Aries = 30° after vernal equinox, regardless of constellation

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i056]` `[trigger: tropical_zodiac_defense]` `[factor_trigger: astro_tropical_signs]` `[role: 主干]` The beginnings of the signs are to be taken from the equinoctial and tropical points—their natures derive from these origins. → Source Text I.25
- `[ns_tetra_i057]` `[trigger: precession_addressed]` `[factor_trigger: astro_epistemology]` `[role: 总结]` If other beginnings were allowed, sign natures would be excluded from prognostication or error would be unavoidable. → Source Text I.25

**Textual Criticism**: This is the definitive Ptolemaic statement on tropical vs sidereal zodiac; cited throughout astrological history.

Each planet is also said to be in its proper chariot, or throne, or otherwise triumphantly situated, when it holds familiarity with the place which it actually occupies by two, or more, of the prescribed modes of connection... Each planet is said to rejoice when any connection subsists between itself and other stars of the same condition... when a planet occupies a place adverse and dissimilar in condition to itself, much of its influence is dissipated and lost.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy describes additional planetary dignities:

**Face (πρόσωπον)**: A planet is "in its face" when its aspect to the Sun/Moon mirrors the aspect of its house to the luminaries' houses. E.g., Venus rules the sextile houses from the luminaries, so Venus is "in face" when sextile the Sun (occidental) or Moon (oriental).

**Chariot/Throne (ἅρμα)**: A planet is "in its chariot" when it holds multiple dignities simultaneously in its current sign (e.g., domicile + triplicity, or exaltation + terms). This greatly strengthens its influence.

**Joy**: A planet "rejoices" when configured with planets of similar nature, even at distance.

**Detriment**: A planet in a sign adverse to its nature loses influence through "admixture" of contrary temperament.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密描述了额外的行星尊贵：

**面（πρόσωπον）**：当行星与太阳/月亮的相位反映其宫位与发光体宫位的相位时，该行星处于"面"中。例如，金星主宰与发光体六分相的宫位，因此金星与太阳六分（西方）或月亮六分（东方）时处于"面"中。

**车架/宝座（ἅρμα）**：当行星在其当前星座同时拥有多重尊贵（如庙旺+三分性，或擢升+界）时，处于"车架"中。这极大增强其影响力。

**喜乐**：当行星与性质相似的行星配置时，即使距离远也"喜乐"。

**损害**：行星在与其性质相反的星座中通过相反气质的"混合"失去影响力。

**Core Points**:
- Face: Aspect to luminaries mirrors house-luminary aspect
- Chariot/Throne: Multiple dignities in same sign = great strength
- Joy: Configuration with similar-natured planets
- Detriment: Contrary sign dissipates influence
- Cumulative dignities strengthen; contrary placements weaken

### 27. Application, Separation, and Planetary Strength (Chapter XXVII)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 2887-2947):
> In all cases when the distances between planets are but trifling, the planet which precedes is said to apply to that which follows; and that which follows to be separating from that which precedes... The influence of each planet is strengthened chiefly when it may be oriental, swift and direct in its proper course and motion—for it has then its greatest power: but, on the other hand, it loses strength when occidental and slow in motion or retrograde... if it be situated in the mid-heaven, or succedent to the mid-heaven, it is especially strong; likewise, if it be on the actual horizon, or succedent to the horizon, it is also powerful.

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Ptolemy defines **application and separation** and summarizes **planetary strength factors**:

**Application**: The faster (more occidental) planet approaches the slower—forming aspect.
**Separation**: The faster planet moves away from the slower—aspect dissolving.

**Strength factors**:
- **Oriental** (rising before Sun): Strong
- **Swift and direct**: Strong
- **Occidental** (setting after Sun): Weaker
- **Slow or retrograde**: Weaker
- **Angular (MC, ASC, DSC, IC)**: Strongest
- **Succedent houses (2, 5, 8, 11)**: Strong
- **Cadent houses (3, 6, 9, 12)**: Weak
- **Below horizon, not aspecting ASC**: Entirely deprived of efficacy

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
托勒密定义了**入相位和离相位**并总结了**行星力量因素**：

**入相位**：较快（更西方）的行星接近较慢的——形成相位。
**离相位**：较快的行星离开较慢的——相位消解。

**力量因素**：
- **东方**（在太阳之前升起）：强
- **快速且顺行**：强
- **西方**（在太阳之后落下）：弱
- **缓慢或逆行**：弱
- **角宫（中天、上升、下降、天底）**：最强
- **续宫（2、5、8、11）**：强
- **果宫（3、6、9、12）**：弱
- **在地平线下，不与上升点相位**：完全失去效力

**Core Points**:
- Application = faster planet approaches slower
- Separation = faster planet departs slower
- Oriental position strengthens; occidental weakens
- Swift/direct = strong; slow/retrograde = weak
- Angular houses = strongest placement
- Succedent = strong; Cadent = weak
- Below horizon without ASC aspect = no efficacy

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_tetra_i060]` `[trigger: application_separation]` `[factor_trigger: astro_aspect_application AND aspect_separation]` `[role: 主干]` The preceding planet applies; the following separates—application forms aspect, separation dissolves it. → Source Text I.27
- `[ns_tetra_i061]` `[trigger: planetary_strength]` `[factor_trigger: astro_planet_strength AND house_angular]` `[role: 主干]` Planets are strongest when oriental, swift, direct, and angular; weakest when occidental, slow, retrograde, and cadent. → Source Text I.27

**Textual Criticism**: Orbs mentioned in footnote: Saturn 10°, Jupiter 12°, Mars 7°30', Sun 17°, Venus 8°, Mercury 7°30', Moon 12°30'.
