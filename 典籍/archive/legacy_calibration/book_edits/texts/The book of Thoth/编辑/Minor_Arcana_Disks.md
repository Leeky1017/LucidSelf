#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Definition | Significance |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Kether in Earth | Crown in Earth | Primordial matter |
| Whirling Disk | Rotating sphere | Living Earth |
| Emerald Green | Isis color | Reborn sacredness |
| Sol-Terra Identity | Sun-Earth unity | Divine matter |

**Title**: The Root of the Powers of Earth (土之力量的根源)
**Qabalistic**: Kether in Earth (土中之冠)
**Astrological**: Root of Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)

**Source Text**:
> "The Ace of Disks pictures the entry of that type of Energy which is called Earth... the old conception of the Earth as a passive, immobile, even dead, even 'evil' element, had to go... to restore the King-Scale colour attribution to that of the Aeon of Isis, Emerald Green... the Disk is a whirling emblem... every Star, every true Planet, is a whirling sphere. The Atom, again, is no more the hard, intractable, dead Particle of Dalton, but a system of whirling forces... About this whirling Disk are its six Wings... This card is thus an affirmation of the identity of Sol and Terra."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Living Earth** – This card embodies the original **energy of Earth**, but transformed for the New Aeon: Earth is no longer passive, dead or evil, but a **whirling, dynamic force**, shown in Emerald Green (the color of Isis reborn). The Disk itself is a rotating sphere with six wings, representing both **Planet Earth** as a living being and the **Atom** as a system of forces. At its center is the hieroglyph of the Beast (666), the Phallus showing Sol and Luna, affirming the **identity of Sun and Earth**: both are alive, both whirl, both are divine. This is the primordial substance in motion, the material foundation of the Universe animated by Spirit.

**Core**: **Manifestation & Matter** – Material foundation, wealth, body, earth as living and sacred, the beginning of physical form.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币一**代表**土元素的原初能量**，但在 Crowley 的"新纪元"重新诠释下，土不再是"被动、僵死、甚至邪恶"的物质，而是一种**旋转、动态、充满生命的力量**。牌面的圆盘以**翡翠绿**（Isis 的重生之绿）为主色调，带有六只翅膀，象征**地球是活的星球、原子是旋转的力量系统**。中心是 666 的象征（野兽的印记），太阳与月亮的结合，宣告**太阳与大地的同一性**——两者都是活生生的存在。它提醒人：物质不是死的、低级的，而是被圣灵贯穿的显化载体，所有形式的根基。

**In Readings**: New material opportunities, wealth, physical manifestation, grounding, embodiment, tangible beginnings, the sacredness of matter.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Crowley's Ace of Disks shows Earth as living, not dead. Whirling disk with six wings represents planet and atom. Emerald Green is Isis reborn. Beast 666 hieroglyph affirms Sol-Terra identity.
- **中文**: Crowley的钱币一展示大地是活的，而非死的。六翼旋转圆盘代表行星和原子。翡翠绿是Isis重生。野兽666象形确认日地同一性。

## Two of Disks: Change (钱币二：变化)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Definition | Significance |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Chokmah in Earth | Wisdom in Earth | Fixed yet changing |
| Jupiter in Capricorn | Expansion + restriction | Paradoxical harmony |
| Ouroboros | Tail-eating serpent | Infinity figure-8 |
| 0=2 | Unity = duality | Change supports stability |

**Title**: Lord of Harmonious Change (和谐变化之主)
**Qabalistic**: Chokmah in Earth (土中之智慧)
**Astrological**: Jupiter in Capricorn (木星入摩羯座)

**Source Text**:
> "The number Two, Chokmah, here rules in the suit pertaining to Earth. It shows the type of Energy appropriate to Two, in its most fixed form. According to the doctrine that Change is the support of stability, the card is called Change. Its celestial rulers are Jupiter and Capricornus; and these symbols are most inharmonious... The card represents two Pantacles, one above the other; they are the Chinese symbols of the Yang and Yin duplicated as in the Hsiang. One wheel is dextro- and the other laevo-rotatory. They thus represent the harmonious interplay of the Four Elements in constant movement... About them is entwined a green Serpent... His tail is in his mouth. He forms the figure Eight, the symbol of the Infinite, the equation 0=2."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Dynamic Balance** – Corresponds to Chokmah (Wisdom/Force) in Earth, showing primal energy in its most **fixed yet paradoxically changing** form. Ruled by **Jupiter in Capricorn** (expansion in restriction), yet the card shows harmony. Two pantacles rotate oppositely: one clockwise, one counter-clockwise, bearing duplicated **Yang/Yin** symbols (Chinese Hsiang). Around them a green **Ouroboros serpent** (tail in mouth) forms the figure-8, the symbol of infinity and the equation **0=2**: Change is the support of stability. This is the dance of dualities in constant motion, creating equilibrium through flux.

**Core**: **Cyclical Change** – Flux, adaptation, rhythmic movement, balancing opposites, the Tao.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币二（变化）**对应土元素中的**Chokmah（智慧/原初力量）**，展示"最固定"的能量形式——而它的名字恰恰叫"变化"，体现"**变化是稳定的支撑**"这一悖论性智慧。统治星为**木星入摩羯座**（扩张被限制，两者本不和谐），但牌面却呈现动态和谐。两个圆盘上下排列，一个顺时针旋转、一个逆时针旋转，上有**阴阳（Yang/Yin）**的中国符号；周围缠绕着绿色衔尾蛇，尾巴咬在嘴里，形成数字8（无穷符号）与方程式 **0=2**。这是对立统一的完美表达：通过不断变化来维持平衡，正如道家所云"动中求静"。

**In Readings**: Change, flux, adaptability, juggling multiple things, ups and downs, maintaining balance through movement, cycles.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Crowley's Two of Disks shows "change is the support of stability". Jupiter in Capricorn paradoxically harmonious. Two wheels rotate opposite with Yang/Yin. Ouroboros forms figure-8 infinity, equation 0=2.
- **中文**: Crowley的钱币二展示"变化是稳定的支撑"。木星入摩羯异常和谐。两个轮子以阴阳相反旋转。衮尾蛇形成无穷数字8，方程式0=2。

| Binah in Earth | Form in Earth | Material establishment |
| Mars in Capricorn | Exalted Mars | Constructive energy |
| Pyramid from Above | Top-down view | Foundation structure |
| Three Wheels | Alchemical triad | Mercury/Sulphur/Salt |

**Title**: Lord of Material Works (物质建造之主)
**Qabalistic**: Binah in Earth (土中之理解)
**Astrological**: Mars in Capricorn (火星入摩羯座)

**Source Text**:
> "The influence of Binah in the sphere of Earth shows the material establishment of the idea of the Universe, the determination of its basic form. It is ruled by Mars in Capricornus; he is exalted in that Sign, and therefore at his best. His energy is constructive, like that of the builder or engineer. The card represents a pyramid viewed from above the apex. The base is formed by three wheels—Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt; Sattvas, Rajas, and Tamas in the Hindu system; Aleph, Shin, and Mem—Air, Fire, and Water—the three Mother letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This pyramid is situated in the great Sea of Binah in the Night of Time, but the sea is solidified..."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Building the Foundation** – Corresponds to Binah (Understanding/Form) in Earth: the **material establishment** of the Universe's basic structure. Ruled by **Mars in Capricorn**, where Mars is exalted and at his best: disciplined, constructive energy like that of a builder or engineer. The image shows a **pyramid viewed from above**, its base formed by three wheels representing **Mercury/Sulphur/Salt** (alchemical principles), **Sattva/Rajas/Tamas** (Hindu gunas), and **Aleph/Shin/Mem** (Hebrew Mother letters: Air/Fire/Water). The pyramid rests in the solidified Sea of Binah, showing form emerging from the primordial matrix. This is **Work**: skilled labor, planning, construction, and the disciplined application of knowledge to matter.

**Core**: **Skilled Construction** – Craftsmanship, engineering, building, disciplined effort, bringing plans into reality.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币三（工作）**对应土元素中的**Binah（理解/大母）**，代表宇宙之观念的**物质确立**与基本形式的决定。统治星为**火星入摩羯座**，这是火星**入旺**（exalted）的位置，能量处于最佳状态：不是破坏性的，而是**建设性的**，像工程师或建筑师那样有计划、有纪律地塑造物质。牌面呈现一座**从顶端俯视的金字塔**，塔基由三个轮子组成，分别代表**水银/硫磺/盐**（炼金三元素）、**悦性/变性/惰性**（印度三德）、以及**Aleph/Shin/Mem**（希伯来三母字母：气/火/水）。金字塔坐落在已凝固的 Binah 之海中，象征**从无形到有形的落实**。这张牌强调通过技能、规划与努力来建造实体成果。

## Four of Disks: Power (钱币四：权力)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Definition | Significance |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Chesed in Earth | Mercy in Earth | Full establishment |
| Sun in Capricorn | Reborn authority | Institutional power |
| Square Disks | Fortress tokens | Law and order |
| Dead Centre | Static point | Risk of rigidity |

**Title**: Lord of Earthly Power (尘世权力之主)
**Qabalistic**: Chesed in Earth (土中之仁慈)
**Astrological**: Sun in Capricorn (太阳入摩羯座)

**Source Text**:
> "The Four, Chesed, shows the establishment of the Universe in three dimensions, that is, below the Abyss. The generating idea is exhibited in its full material sense. The card is ruled by the Sun in Capricornus, the Sign in which he is reborn. The disks are very large and solid; the suggestion of the card is that of a fortress. This represents Law and Order, maintained by constant authority and vigilance. The disks themselves are square; revolution is very opposite to the card; and they contain the signs of the Four Elements... defence is valid only when violently active. So far as it appears stationary, it is the 'dead centre' of the engineer..."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Fortress of Order** – Corresponds to Chesed (Mercy/Structure) in Earth: the **full establishment** of the material universe in three dimensions (below the Abyss). Ruled by **Sun in Capricorn**, the sign of the Sun's rebirth at winter solstice. The disks are large, solid, and **square** – suggesting a **fortress**: Law, Order, and Power maintained by constant authority. Each disk contains a symbol of one of the Four Elements. Though they appear static, they do revolve; defense is only valid when **actively maintained**. This is **Power**: established authority, structure, security, and material dominion, but it requires vigilance or it becomes a "dead center."

**Core**: **Established Authority** – Power, stability, law, order, fortress mentality, material security, but risk of rigidity.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币四（权力）**对应土元素中的**Chesed（仁慈/秩序）**，展示宇宙在三维空间中的**完全建立**（深渊之下的显化）。统治星为**太阳入摩羯座**，这是太阳在冬至**重生**的位置。圆盘非常大且坚固，形状为**方形**，整体给人**堡垒**的感觉：法律、秩序、权力通过持续的权威与警戒来维持。每个方形圆盘上包含四元素之一的符号。虽然看起来静止，它们其实仍在旋转——因为**防御只有在主动行动时才有效**。这张牌代表既定权威与物质保障，但若过于僵化不动，就会成为工程学意义上的"死点"（dead center）。

**In Readings**: Power, authority, stability, security, established structures, law and order, material success, but also rigidity, fortress mentality, control.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Crowley's Four of Disks shows Chesed establishing Universe below Abyss. Sun in Capricorn reborn. Square disks suggest fortress. Defense valid only when active - or becomes "dead centre".
- **中文**: Crowley的钱币四展示Chesed在深渊之下确立宇宙。太阳入摩羯重生。方形圆盘暗示堡垒。防御只有积极时才有效—否则变成"死点"。

## Five of Disks: Worry (钱币五：忧虑)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Definition | Significance |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Geburah in Earth | Severity in Earth | Disruption |
| Mercury in Taurus | Mind vs matter | Strain and anxiety |
| Inverted Pentagram | Unstable base | Earthquake effect |
| Five Tattvas | Hindu elements | Barely holding |

**Title**: Lord of Material Trouble (物质困扰之主)
**Qabalistic**: Geburah in Earth (土中之严厉)
**Astrological**: Mercury in Taurus (水星入金牛座)

**Source Text**:
> "The Number Five, Geburah, in the suit of Earth, shows the disruption of the Elements, just as in the other suits. This is emphasized by the rule of Mercury in Taurus, types of energy which are opposed. It needs a very powerful Mercury to upset Taurus; so the natural meaning is Intelligence applied to Labour. The symbol represents five disks in the form of the inverted Pentagram, instability in the very foundations of Matter. The effect is that of an earthquake. They are, however, representative of the five Tatvas; these hold together, on a very low plane, an organism which would otherwise disrupt completely..."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Unstable Foundation** – Corresponds to Geburah (Severity/Disruption) in Earth. As in other suits, Five brings disruption; here **Mercury in Taurus** pits restless intellect against immovable stability. It takes a very strong Mercury to upset Taurus, so the card represents **intelligence applied to labor** – but often with strain, anxiety, and insecurity. The five disks form an **inverted pentagram**, showing **instability in the very foundations of matter** – like an earthquake. However, they also represent the **five Tattvas** (Hindu elements), which barely hold together the organism that would otherwise fall apart. This is **Worry**: financial strain, job insecurity, material anxiety, and the effort to prevent collapse.

**Core**: **Material Anxiety** – Worry, financial strain, job insecurity, poverty consciousness, unstable foundations.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币五（忧虑）**对应土元素中的**Geburah（严厉/破坏）**，一如其它花色的五号牌，带来扰动与瓦解。统治星为**水星入金牛座**——两者本质对立：水星灵活多变，金牛固定稳定。牌义指向"**智力应用于劳动**"，但往往伴随巨大的**压力、焦虑与不安全感**。五个圆盘排列成**倒五芒星**，象征**物质基础的不稳定**，效果如同地震。然而，它们也代表印度的**五大元素（Tattvas）**，勉强把一个本该崩溃的有机体维系在一起。这张牌常指向：财务困难、失业风险、入不敷出、对物质匮乏的恐惧，以及为防止彻底崩溃而持续的紧张努力。

**In Readings**: Worry, financial problems, job loss, material insecurity, strain, hardship, fear of poverty, barely holding together.

## Six of Disks: Success (钱币六：成功)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Definition | Significance |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Tiphareth in Earth | Beauty in Earth | Full harmony |
| Moon in Taurus | Exalted Moon | Transient perfection |
| Hexagram Layout | Six-pointed star | Planetary balance |
| Rose & Cross | 49 petals | Spiritual-material union |

**Title**: Lord of Material Success (物质成功之主)
**Qabalistic**: Tiphareth in Earth (土中之美)
**Astrological**: Moon in Taurus (月亮入金牛座)

**Source Text**:
> "The Number Six, Tiphareth, as before, represents the full harmonious establishment of the Energy of the Element. The Moon in Taurus rules the card; and this, while increasing the approach to perfection (for the Moon is exalted in Taurus and therefore in her highest form) marks that the condition is transient. The disks are arranged in the form of the Hexagram... In the centre blushes and glows the light rose-madder of dawn... These colours show Tiphareth fully realized on Earth... The planets are arranged in accordance with their usual attribution; but they are only shown as disks irradiated by the Sun in their centre. This Sun is idolized as the Rose and Cross; the Rose has forty-nine petals, the interplay of the Seven with the Seven."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Harmonious Prosperity** – Corresponds to Tiphareth (Beauty/Harmony) in Earth: the **full harmonious establishment** of material energy. Ruled by **Moon in Taurus**, where the Moon is exalted and in her highest form, bringing perfection – yet also marking this as **transient**. Six disks form a hexagram, with a glowing rose-madder center (dawn), showing **Tiphareth fully realized on Earth**. The planets radiate from a central Sun depicted as the **Rose and Cross** with 49 petals (7×7). This is **Success**: material prosperity, harmonious work, beauty in tangible form, and the union of spiritual and material – but always temporary.

**Core**: **Material Harmony** – Success, prosperity, generosity, fair exchange, beauty in work, but transient.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币六（成功）**对应土元素中的**Tiphareth（美/和谐/中心）**，代表物质能量的**完满和谐建立**。统治星为**月亮入金牛座**，这是月亮**入旺**（exalted）的位置，处于最高形式，带来趋向完美的状态——但同时也标志着这种状态是**短暂的**（transient）。六个圆盘排列成**六芒星**，中心泛出玫瑰红色（黎明之光），象征**Tiphareth 在大地上的完全实现**。行星们按通常对应排列，从中央的太阳放射出光芒；太阳以**玫瑰十字**的形式被理想化，玫瑰有 49 瓣（7×7 的交互）。这是**成功**：物质繁荣、和谐劳动、有形之美、灵性与物质的结合——但终归是暂时的幸福时刻。

**In Readings**: Success, prosperity, fair exchange, generosity, material harmony, beauty realized, reward for work, but also awareness of impermanence.

## Seven of Disks: Failure (钱币七：失败)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Definition | Significance |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Netzach in Earth | Victory in Earth | Weakening effect |
| Saturn in Taurus | Heavy restriction | Crushing growth |
| Rubeus Pattern | Ugly geomantic | Blight symbol |
| Leaden Disks | Saturn metal | Bad money |

**Title**: Lord of Success Unfulfilled (未遂成功之主)
**Qabalistic**: Netzach in Earth (土中之胜利/情感)
**Astrological**: Saturn in Taurus (土星入金牛座)

**Source Text**:
> "The number Seven, Netzach, has its customary enfeebling effect, and this is made worse by the influence of Saturn in Taurus. The disks are arranged in the shape of the geomantic figure Rubeus, the most ugly and menacing of the Sixteen. (See Five of Cups.) The atmosphere of the card is that of Blight. On the background, which represents vegetation and cultivation, everything is spoiled. The four colours of Netzach appear, but they are blotched with angry indigo and reddish orange. The disks themselves are the leaden disks of Saturn. They suggest bad money."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Blighted Growth** – Corresponds to Netzach (Victory/Emotion) in Earth, but with its usual **weakening effect**. Made worse by **Saturn in Taurus**: heavy restriction crushing stable growth. The disks form **Rubeus**, the geomantic figure called "the most ugly and menacing" – a pattern of blight and decay. The background shows vegetation and cultivation, but everything is spoiled and ruined. The colors are blotched with angry indigo and reddish orange; the disks themselves are **leaden** (Saturn's metal), suggesting counterfeit money, failed investments, or effort that bears no fruit. This is **Failure**: thwarted ambition, wasted work, crops that rot before harvest, promises unfulfilled.

**Core**: **Frustrated Effort** – Failure, blight, wasted labor, bad investments, unfulfilled promise, decay.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币七（失败）**对应土元素中的**Netzach（胜利/情感能量）**，但这里它带来的是**衰弱效应**。加上**土星入金牛座**的沉重限制，将本该稳定增长的物质彻底压垮。七个圆盘排列成地卜图**Rubeus**（红色），被称为十六卦中"最丑陋、最凶险"的图形，象征**枯萎与腐败**。背景是田地与耕作，但一切都已毁坏；颜色中掺杂着愤怒的靛蓝与橙红；圆盘本身是土星的**铅质**圆盘，暗示假币、失败投资、或付出却毫无收获。这张牌代表：抱负落空、劳动白费、庄稼在收获前腐烂、承诺无法兑现的挫败与失望。

**In Readings**: Failure, disappointment, wasted effort, bad investments, blight, decay, unfulfilled ambition, projects that collapse before completion.

| Hod in Earth | Intellect in Earth | Mercurial help |
| Sun in Virgo | Meticulous vitality | Intelligence to matter |
| Populus Pattern | Tree figure | Deep roots |
| Turn of Tide | Nadir renewal | After failure |

**Title**: Lord of Prudence (审慎之主)
**Qabalistic**: Hod in Earth (土中之荣光)
**Astrological**: Sun in Virgo (太阳入处女座)

**Source Text**:
> "The number Eight, Hod, is very helpful in this card, because it represents Mercury in his most spiritual aspect, and he both rules and is exalted in the sign of Virgo... It signifies intelligence lovingly applied to material matters, especially those of the agriculturalist, the artificer and the engineer... this card marks the turn of the tide... These last three cards seem to prepare the explosion which will renew the whole Cycle... The disks are arranged in the form of the geomantic figure Populus. These disks may be represented as the flowers or fruits of a great tree, its solid roots in fertile land."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Intelligent Cultivation** – Corresponds to Hod (Intellect) in Earth. Mercury rules and is exalted in Virgo, Sun governs decan: **intelligence lovingly applied to material matters**. After Seven's Failure, this marks **the turn of the tide**: the nadir becomes seed of renewal. Disks form **Populus**, shown as tree with deep roots. This is **Prudence**: careful cultivation, skilled work, patient growth.

**Core**: **Skillful Work** – Prudence, craftsmanship, patience, learning, planting for future.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币八（审慎）**对应**Hod（智力）**。水星在处女座入庙入旺，太阳统治：**智慧以爱应用于物质**。七之后**潮水转向**：最低点孕育更新。圆盘排成**Populus**，大树深根。这是**审慎**：谨慎耕耘、精湛技艺、耐心成长。

## Nine of Disks: Gain (钱币九：获得)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Definition | Significance |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Yesod in Earth | Foundation in Earth | Balance restored |
| Venus in Virgo | Refined enjoyment | Good luck |
| Triangle + Hexagon | 3+6 pattern | Multiplication |
| Degraded Essence | Concrete but less magical | Quantity vs quality |

**Title**: Lord of Material Gain (物质获得之主)
**Qabalistic**: Yesod in Earth (土中之基础)
**Astrological**: Venus in Virgo (金星入处女座)

**Source Text**:
> "The number Nine, Yesod, inevitably brings back the balance of Force in fulfilment. The card is ruled by Venus in Virgo. It shows good luck attending material affairs, favour and popularity. The disks are arranged as an equilateral triangle of three... and... six larger disks in the form of a hexagon. This signifies the multiplication of the original established Word—by the mingling of 'good luck and good management'... the multiplication of a symbol of Energy always tends to degrade its essential meaning..."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Multiplication of Wealth** – Yesod in Earth: balance restored in fulfillment. **Venus in Virgo** brings good luck, favor. Three magical disks (triangle) + six coins (hexagon). **Multiplication** through "luck and management," but with degradation of essence: wealth becomes concrete but less magical. This is **Gain**: increase, prosperity, but risk of losing original purity.

**Core**: **Prosperity & Increase** – Gain, good fortune, material growth, but complexity and potential hollowness.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币九（获得）**对应**Yesod（基础）**：平衡恢复。**金星入处女**带来好运。三魔法盘+六钱币。**倍增**通过"运气与管理"，但削弱本质：财富更具体却失去魔法性。这是**获得**：增长、繁荣，但"更多"未必"更好"。

**In Readings**: Gain, increase, good luck, material success, popularity, but also complexity of accumulation.

## Ten of Disks: Wealth (钱币十：财富)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

#### Key Term Analysis

| Term | Definition | Significance |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Malkuth in Earth | Kingdom in Earth | Final solidification |
| Mercury in Virgo | Analytical wealth | Warning inertia |
| Tree of Life | Sephirothic layout | Culmination |
| Sun at Hod | Logos in matter | Regeneration key |

**Title**: Lord of Wealth (财富之主)
**Qabalistic**: Malkuth in Earth (土中之王国)
**Astrological**: Mercury in Virgo (水星入处女座)

**Source Text**:
> "The number Ten, Malkuth, as always, represents the final issue of the Energy. Here is great and final solidification... force is completely expended and results in death. Mercury rules this card in Virgo; and this may imply that the acquired wealth, being inert, will be dissipated unless put to further use... The disks... are arranged on the Tree of Life, but the Tenth coin is much larger than the rest; the image indicates the futility of material gain... except that the coin in the place of Hod (Mercury) on the Tree is marked with the cipher of the Sun. This indicates the only possibility of issue from the impasse... This card is in fact a hieroglyph of the cycle of regeneration."

**English Paraphrase**:
**The End and the Seed** – Malkuth in Earth: **final issue**, complete solidification, force expended to "death." **Mercury in Virgo** warns: inert wealth dissipates unless used beyond hoarding. Ten coins on Tree; tenth (Malkuth) largest, showing **futility**. But coin at Hod bears Sun's cipher: the **way out** – Father's Will (Logos) inherent in matter, Virgin pregnant with future. **Wealth** as culmination and potential rebirth – regeneration cycle hidden in densest matter.

**Core**: **Culmination & Rebirth** – Wealth, inheritance, completion, but stagnation unless renewed; seed in stone.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币十（财富）**对应**Malkuth（王国）**：**最终发放**，完全固化，力量耗尽至"死亡"。**水星入处女**警告：惰性财富会消散。十币在生命树上；第十枚最大，显示**徒劳**。但 Hod 处的币标有**太阳符号**：**唯一出路**——物质中蕴含父神意志，处女怀着未来。**财富**既是终结也是潜在重生——最稠密物质中的再生循环。

**In Readings**: Wealth, inheritance, completion, family legacy, but also stagnation, need to use wealth wisely; hidden seed of renewal.

**Zodiac**: 21° Leo to 20° Virgo (狮子座21度至处女座20度)

**Source Text**:
> "The Knight of Disks represents the fiery part of Earth, and refers in particular to the phenomena of mountains, earthquakes, and gravitation; but it also represents the activity of Earth regarded as the producer of Life... He is armed with a flail. The disk which he bears... represents nutrition... a shire horse, solidly planted on all four feet... He rides through the fertile land... Those whom he symbolizes tend to be dull, heavy and preoccupied with material things. They are laborious and patient, but would have little intellectual grasp... Their success... is due to instinct, to imitation of Nature. They lack initiative; their fire is the smouldering fire of the process of growth."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Steady Cultivation** – **Fire of Earth**: mountains, earthquakes, gravity, Earth as life-producer. Wields flail (agriculture), rides shire horse solidly planted, through fertile fields. Archetype of **laborer/farmer**: patient, hard-working, instinctive, close to nature, but dull, limited vision. Fire is slow smoldering growth, not dramatic flame. Negatively: slavish, unable to think beyond immediate material concerns, resentful but passive.

**Core**: **Practical Labor** – Agriculture, physical work, patient effort, limited vision and initiative.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**钱币骑士**代表**土中之火**：山脉、地震、重力，大地作为生命生产者。手持连枷，骑役马（四脚稳立），穿过肥沃耕地。**劳动者/农夫**原型：耐心、勤劳、本能、亲近自然，但迟钝、视野有限。火是缓慢闷烧的生长，非戏剧性火焰。负向：奴性、无法超越眼前物质思考、怨恨但消极。

**Source Text**:
> "The Queen of Disks represents the watery part of Earth, the function of that element as Mother... throned upon the life of vegetation. She contemplates the background, where a calm river winds through a sandy desert to bring to it fertility. Oases are beginning to shew themselves... Before her stands a goat upon a sphere... Her armour is composed of small scales or coins... She thus represents the ambition of matter to take part in the great work of Creation... These people are quiet, hard-working, practical, sensible, domesticated, often (in a reticent and unassuming fashion) lustful and even debauched."

**English Paraphrase**:
**The Fertile Mother** – **Water of Earth**: Earth's function as **Mother** and nurturer. Throned on vegetation, gazes at river through desert bringing fertility; oases bloom. Goat on sphere (fertility as Great Work). Coin-armor; cube-scepter with 3D hexagram; sphere-disk of loops. **Matter's ambition to participate in Creation**. Quiet, practical, hard-working, sensible, domesticated, with deep (often hidden) sensuality. Negatively: dull, servile, mechanically living.

**Core**: **Nurturing Materiality** – Motherhood, fertility, practical care, quiet strength, risk of drudgery.

**Chinese Explanation**:

**Title**: Princess of the Echoing Hills, Rose of the Palace of Earth (回响山丘公主，土之宫殿之玫瑰)
**Elemental**: The Earthy part of Earth (土中之土)
**Rule**: Quadrant around North Pole (北极周围象限)

**Source Text**:
> "The Princess of Disks, the last of the Court cards, represents the earthy part of Earth. She is consequently on the brink of transfiguration. She is strong and beautiful, with an expression of intense brooding, as if about to become aware of secret wonder. Her crest is the head of the ram, and her sceptre descends into the earth. There its head becomes a diamond, the precious stone of Kether, thus symbolizing the birth of the highest and purest light in the deepest and darkest of the Elements. She stands within a grove of sacred trees before an altar suggesting a wheatsheaf, for she is a priestess of Demeter. She bears within her body the secret of the future. Her sublimity is further emphasized by the disk which she bears; for in the centre thereof is the Chinese ideogram denoting the twin spiral force of Creation in perfect equilibrium; from this is born the rose of Isis, the great fertile Mother... She is Womanhood in its ultimate projection... every turn of the wheel is equally probable, and equally a prize; for every Event is 'a play of Nuit'."
