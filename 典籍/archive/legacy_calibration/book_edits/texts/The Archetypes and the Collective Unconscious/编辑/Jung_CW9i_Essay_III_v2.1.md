## Section 1: On the Concept of the Archetype (¶148-155)

### 1.1 Platonic Background and Empirical Position (¶148-150)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶148-150, Lines 2330-2374):

> [148] The concept of the Great Mother belongs to the field of comparative religion and embraces widely varying types of mother-goddess. The concept itself is of no immediate concern to psychology, because the image of a Great Mother in this form is rarely encountered in practice... The symbol is obviously a derivative of the mother archetype...
>
> [149] In former times... it was not too difficult to understand Plato's conception of the Idea as supraordinate and pre-existent to all phenomena. "Archetype," far from being a modern term, was already in use before the time of St. Augustine, and was synonymous with "Idea" in the Platonic usage... Were I a philosopher, I should continue in this Platonic strain and say: Somewhere, in "a place beyond the skies," there is a prototype or primordial image of the mother that is pre-existent and supraordinate to all phenomena in which the "maternal," in the broadest sense of the term, is manifest. But I am an empiricist, not a philosopher...
>
> [150] Yet every victory contains the germ of future defeat... Kant's doctrine of categories... paves the way for a rebirth of the Platonic spirit. If it be true that there can be no metaphysics transcending human reason, it is no less true that there can be no empirical knowledge that is not already caught and limited by the a priori structure of cognition.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Great Mother | Religious goddess | Comparative religion concept | Not direct psychology |
| Mother archetype | Psychological pattern | Underlying the Great Mother | Jung's focus |
| Platonic Idea | Supraordinate form | Pre-existent prototype | Philosophical background |
| A priori structure | Pre-experiential forms | Kant's categories | Modern parallel |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

Jung establishes his **empirical position** on archetypes:

**Great Mother vs Mother Archetype**:
- Great Mother = comparative religion concept (mother-goddesses)
- Mother archetype = psychological foundation (Jung's focus)
- Great Mother is "derivative" of the archetype

**Platonic parallel**:
- "Archetype" used before St. Augustine = synonymous with Platonic "Idea"
- Plato: Ideas are supraordinate and pre-existent to phenomena
- A philosopher would say: primordial mother-image exists "beyond the skies"

**Jung's empiricist stance**:
- "I am an empiricist, not a philosopher"
- Cannot presuppose his own temperament is universal
- But: Kant's categories bridge empiricism and Platonism
- A priori structure of cognition shapes all empirical knowledge

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

荣格确立其对原型的**经验主义立场**：

**大母神vs母亲原型**：
- 大母神 = 比较宗教概念（母神）
- 母亲原型 = 心理学基础（荣格焦点）
- 大母神是原型的"衍生物"

**柏拉图平行**：
- "原型"在圣奥古斯丁之前使用 = 等同于柏拉图"理念"
- 柏拉图：理念是超越和先于现象的
- 哲学家会说：原初母亲意象存在于"天外"

**荣格的经验主义立场**：
- "我是经验主义者，非哲学家"
- 不能预设自己的气质是普遍的
- 但：康德的范畴桥接经验主义与柏拉图主义
- 认知的先验结构塑造所有经验知识

**Core Points**:
- Great Mother (religion) derives from mother archetype (psychology)
- "Archetype" = ancient term, synonymous with Platonic Idea
- Jung positions himself as empiricist, not metaphysician
- But acknowledges a priori structures shape cognition (Kantian)
- Archetypes are psychological equivalents of Platonic Ideas

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_III_001]` `[trigger: archetype_platonic]` `[factor_trigger: jung_archetype AND jung_jung_platonic_idea AND jung_a_priori_form]` `[role: 主干]` "Archetype" was synonymous with "Idea" in Platonic usage—pre-existent and supraordinate to phenomena. → ¶149
- `[ns_cw9i_III_002]` `[trigger: jung_empiricist]` `[factor_trigger: jung_methodology AND empiricist_stance]` `[role: 条件分支]` I am an empiricist, not a philosopher—I cannot presuppose my own disposition is universal. → ¶149
- `[ns_cw9i_III_003]` `[trigger: apriori_cognition]` `[factor_trigger: jung_archetype]` `[role: 主干依赖]` There can be no empirical knowledge that is not already caught and limited by the a priori structure of cognition. → ¶150

### 1.2 A Priori Psyche and Hereditary Predisposition (¶151-154)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶151-154, Lines 2400-2457):

> [151] There is an a priori factor in all human activities, namely the inborn, preconscious and unconscious individual structure of the psyche. The preconscious psyche—for example, that of a new-born infant—is not an empty vessel into which anything can be poured. On the contrary, it is a tremendously complicated, sharply defined individual entity.
>
> [152] Man possesses a preformed psyche which breeds true to his species. We cannot know the nature of the preconscious psychic disposition that enables a child to react in a human manner. We can only suppose that his behaviour results from patterns of functioning—"images." These are "primordial" images, the "human quality" of the human being.
>
> [153] Since everything psychic is preformed, this must also be true of the individual functions, especially creative fantasy. In the products of fantasy the primordial images are made visible—here the concept of the archetype finds its specific application. I have shown that archetypes can rearise spontaneously, at any time, at any place, without any outside influence.
>
> [154] There are present in every psyche forms which are unconscious but nonetheless active—living dispositions, ideas in the Platonic sense, that preform and continually influence our thoughts, feelings, and actions.

**English Paraphrase**:
- A priori factor in all human activities = inborn psychic structure
- Newborn psyche = NOT empty vessel but complicated individual entity
- Man has preformed psyche breeding true to species
- Behaviour results from "images" = primordial patterns = "human quality"
- Creative fantasy = where primordial images become visible
- Archetypes can rearise spontaneously without outside influence
- Unconscious forms = living dispositions preforming thoughts/feelings/actions

**中文诠释**:
- 所有人类活动的先验因素 = 先天心理结构
- 新生儿心灵 = 非空容器而是复杂的个体实体
- 人有繁殖真实物种的预成心灵
- 行为来自"意象" = 原始模式 = "人的品质"
- 创造性幻想 = 原始意象变得可见之处
- 原型可自发重现，无需外部影响
- 无意识形式 = 预成思想/感受/行动的活性倾向

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_III_151]` `[trigger: preconscious]` `[factor_trigger: jung_psyche AND jung_archetype]` `[role: 主干]` Preconscious psyche is NOT empty vessel—tremendously complicated individual entity. → ¶151
- `[ns_cw9i_III_152]` `[trigger: primordial_images]` `[factor_trigger: jung_archetype AND jung_behavior]` `[role: 主干依赖]` Man's behaviour results from "images"—primordial patterns, the "human quality." → ¶152

- `[ns_cw9i_III_154]` `[trigger: unconscious_forms]` `[factor_trigger: jung_unconscious AND jung_archetype]` `[role: 总结]` Present in every psyche: unconscious but active forms—living dispositions preforming thoughts. → ¶154

### 1.3 The Crystal Analogy (¶155)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶155, Lines 2459-2482):

> [155] Again and again I encounter the mistaken notion that an archetype is determined in regard to its content, in other words that it is a kind of unconscious idea (if such an expression be admissible). It is necessary to point out once more that archetypes are not determined as regards their content, but only as regards their form and then only to a very limited degree... Its form, however... might perhaps be compared to the axial system of a crystal, which, as it were, preforms the crystalline structure in the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its own. This first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregate. The archetype in itself is empty and purely formal, nothing but a facultas praeformandi, a possibility of representation which is given a priori. The representations themselves are not inherited, only the forms, and in that respect they correspond in every way to the instincts, which are also determined in form only.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Axial system | Crystal structure | Archetype form | Preforming pattern |
| Mother liquid | Solution | Conscious experience | Content source |
| Facultas praeformandi | Preforming capacity | Empty pattern | Archetype nature |
| Form vs content | Structure vs substance | Inherited vs acquired | Key distinction |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

Jung's famous **crystal analogy** for archetypes:

**Common misconception**:
- Mistake: archetype = "unconscious idea" with determined content
- Correction: archetypes determined ONLY in form, not content

**Crystal analogy**:
- Archetype = like crystal's axial system
- **Axial system preforms structure** in mother liquid
- But has **no material existence of its own**
- Visible structure appears when ions/molecules aggregate

**Key definition**:
- "Archetype in itself is empty and purely formal"
- It is **facultas praeformandi** = "preforming capacity"
- A "possibility of representation which is given a priori"
- **Representations not inherited; only forms**
- Archetypes = formal patterns like instincts

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

荣格著名的**晶体类比**解释原型：

**常见误解**：
- 错误：原型 = 有确定内容的"无意识观念"
- 纠正：原型仅在形式上确定，非内容

**晶体类比**：
- 原型 = 如晶体的轴系
- **轴系在母液中预成结构**
- 但**自身没有物质存在**
- 可见结构在离子/分子聚合时出现

**关键定义**：
- "原型本身是空的、纯形式的"
- 它是 **facultas praeformandi** = "预成能力"
- "先验给定的表征可能性"
- **表征不遗传；只有形式遗传**
- 原型 = 形式模式如本能

**Core Points**:
- Archetype = form only, not content
- Crystal analogy: axial system preforms but has no material existence
- Archetype is "empty and purely formal"
- Facultas praeformandi = preforming capacity
- Representations (content) not inherited; only forms
- Archetypes parallel instincts (both formal patterns)

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_III_004]` `[trigger: archetype_form_not_content]` `[factor_trigger: jung_archetype]` `[role: 主干]` Archetypes are not determined as regards their content, but only as regards their form—they correspond in every way to instincts. → ¶155
- `[ns_cw9i_III_005]` `[trigger: crystal_analogy]` `[factor_trigger: jung_archetype]` `[role: 主干依赖]` The archetype's form might be compared to the axial system of a crystal, which preforms the structure in the mother liquid although it has no material existence of its own. → ¶155

## Section 2: The Mother Archetype (¶156-158)

### 2.1 Symbols of the Mother (¶156-157)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶156-157, Lines 2486-2512):

> [156] Like any other archetype, the mother archetype appears under an almost infinite variety of aspects. I mention here only some of the more characteristic. First in importance are the personal mother and grandmother, stepmother and mother-in-law; then any woman with whom a relationship exists... Then there are what might be termed mothers in a figurative sense. To this category belongs the goddess, and especially the Mother of God, the Virgin, and Sophia. Mythology offers many variations... Other symbols of the mother in a figurative sense appear in things representing the goal of our longing for redemption, such as Paradise, the Kingdom of God, the Heavenly Jerusalem. Many things arousing devotion or feelings of awe, as for instance the Church, university, city or country, heaven, earth, the woods, the sea or any still waters, matter even, the underworld and the moon, can be mother-symbols. The archetype is often associated with things and places standing for fertility and fruitfulness: the cornucopia, a ploughed field, a garden. It can be attached to a rock, a cave, a tree, a spring, a deep well, or to various vessels such as the baptismal font, or to vessel-shaped flowers like the rose or the lotus. Because of the protection it implies, the magic circle or mandala can be a form of mother archetype. Hollow objects such as ovens and cooking vessels are associated with the mother archetype, and, of course, the uterus, yoni, and anything of a like shape...
>
> [157] All these symbols can have a positive, favourable meaning or a negative, evil meaning. An ambivalent aspect is seen in the goddesses of fate (Moira, Graeae, Norns). Evil symbols are the witch, the dragon (or any devouring and entwining animal, such as a large fish or a serpent), the grave, the sarcophagus, deep water, death, nightmares and bogies (Empusa, Lilith, etc.).

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Personal mother | Actual mother | First carrier | Biographical |
| Figurative mother | Symbolic mother | Goddess, Church, Nature | Archetypal |
| Vessel | Container | Womb symbol | Fertility |
| Devouring mother | Destructive feminine | Dragon, witch, deep water | Negative pole |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

Jung catalogs **mother archetype symbols**:

**Personal carriers**:
- Mother, grandmother, stepmother, mother-in-law
- Any woman with whom relationship exists

**Figurative/symbolic mothers**:
- **Goddesses**: Mother of God, Virgin, Sophia
- **Mythological**: Demeter-Kore, Cybele-Attis
- **Redemptive places**: Paradise, Kingdom of God, Heavenly Jerusalem
- **Institutions/nature**: Church, university, city, country, earth, woods, sea, moon
- **Fertility symbols**: Cornucopia, ploughed field, garden
- **Containers**: Cave, spring, well, vessels, baptismal font, rose, lotus
- **Protection**: Magic circle, mandala
- **Hollow objects**: Ovens, cooking vessels, uterus, yoni

**Positive/Negative polarity**:
- **Positive**: Cherishing, nurturing, protecting, transforming
- **Negative**: Witch, dragon, devouring fish, serpent, grave, deep water, death, Lilith
- **Ambivalent**: Fates (Moira, Norns)

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

荣格编目**母亲原型象征**：

- Personal mother is first carrier; figurative mothers extend universally
- Symbols include: goddesses, nature, containers, institutions
- Mandala can be mother-symbol (protection)
- Polarity: cherishing positive vs devouring negative

### 2.2 Qualities of the Mother Archetype (¶158)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶158, Lines 2514-2535):

> [158] The qualities associated with it are maternal solicitude and sympathy; the magic authority of the female; the wisdom and spiritual exaltation that transcend reason; any helpful instinct or impulse; all that is benign, all that cherishes and sustains, that fosters growth and fertility. The place of magic transformation and rebirth, together with the underworld and its inhabitants, are presided over by the mother. On the negative side the mother archetype may connote anything secret, hidden, dark; the abyss, the world of the dead, anything that devours, seduces, and poisons, that is terrifying and inescapable like fate. All these attributes of the mother archetype have been fully described and documented in my book Symbols of Transformation. There I formulated the ambivalence of these attributes as "the loving and the terrible mother." Perhaps the historical example of the dual nature of the mother most familiar to us is the Virgin Mary, who is not only the Lord's mother, but also, according to the medieval allegories, his cross. In India, "the loving and terrible mother" is the paradoxical Kali.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Maternal solicitude | Caring | Positive mother | Nurturing |
| Magic authority | Numinous power | Female wisdom | Transcending reason |
| Loving and terrible | Dual nature | Ambivalence | Virgin Mary, Kali |
| Transformation/rebirth | Death and renewal | Underworld connection | Initiation |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

Jung summarizes **mother archetype qualities**:

**Positive qualities**:
- Maternal solicitude and sympathy
- "Magic authority of the female"
- Wisdom and spiritual exaltation transcending reason
- Helpful instinct/impulse
- All that cherishes, sustains, fosters growth

**Transformative function**:
- Presides over "place of magic transformation and rebirth"
- Together with underworld and its inhabitants

**Negative qualities**:
- Anything secret, hidden, dark
- Abyss, world of the dead
- Devouring, seducing, poisoning
- "Terrifying and inescapable like fate"

**The dual nature**:
- Formulated as **"the loving and the terrible mother"**
- **Virgin Mary**: Lord's mother AND jung_his cross
- **Kali**: Indian paradoxical loving-terrible mother

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

荣格总结**母亲原型品质**：

**正面品质**：
- 母性关怀与同情
- "女性的魔法权威"
- 超越理性的智慧与精神升华
- 有益本能/冲动
- 一切珍爱、维持、促进成长的

**转化功能**：
- 主宰"魔法转化与重生之地"
- 与冥界及其居民同在

**负面品质**：
- 一切秘密、隐藏、黑暗的
- 深渊、亡者世界
- 吞噬、诱惑、毒害
- "如命运般恐怖且不可逃避"

**双重本质**：
- 表述为**"慈爱与可怕的母亲"**
- **圣母玛利亚**：主的母亲也是他的十字架
- **卡莉**：印度矛盾的慈爱-可怕母亲

**Core Points**:
- Positive: solicitude, magic authority, wisdom, nourishment
- Mother presides over transformation, rebirth, underworld
- Negative: secret, dark, devouring, poisoning, fatal
- "Loving and terrible mother" = fundamental ambivalence
- Virgin Mary = mother AND jung_cross (medieval allegory)
- Kali = paradigmatic paradoxical mother

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_III_009]` `[trigger: mother_qualities]` `[factor_trigger: jung_mother_archetype]` `[role: 主干]` The mother archetype's qualities: maternal solicitude, magic authority, wisdom transcending reason, and all that cherishes and sustains—but also the abyss, the world of the dead, all that devours and poisons. → ¶158

### 2.3 Personal Mother vs Archetype (¶159-160)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶159-160, Lines 2537-2580):

> [159] Although the figure of the mother as it appears in folklore is more or less universal, this image changes markedly when it appears in the individual psyche. The personal mother looms so large in personalistic psychologies that they never got beyond it. My view differs: I attribute to the personal mother only a limited aetiological significance. All those influences do not come from the mother herself, but from the archetype projected upon her, which gives her mythological background and invests her with authority and numinosity.
>
> [160] Archetypes are among the inalienable assets of every psyche. They form the "treasure in the realm of shadowy thoughts" of which Kant spoke. An archetype is in no sense just an annoying prejudice; it becomes so only when in the wrong place. Archetypal images are among the highest values of the human psyche—they have peopled the heavens of all races. Our task is not to deny the archetype, but to dissolve projections, restoring contents to the individual who has lost them.

**English Paraphrase**:
- Personal mother = limited aetiological significance
- True influence = archetype projected upon her
- Archetype gives mythological background + numinosity
- Archetypes = inalienable assets, highest values
- Task = dissolve projections, restore contents to individual

**中文诠释**:
- 个人母亲 = 有限的病因学意义
- 真正影响 = 投射于其上的原型
- 原型赋予神话背景 + 神圣性
- 原型 = 不可剥夺的资产，最高价值
- 任务 = 解除投射，将内容归还个体

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_III_159]` `[trigger: mother_projection]` `[factor_trigger: jung_mother AND jung_archetype]` `[role: 主干]` Personal mother has only limited significance—true influence is the archetype projected upon her. → ¶159
- `[ns_cw9i_III_160]` `[trigger: dissolve_projection]` `[factor_trigger: jung_projection AND jung_archetype]` `[role: 主干依赖]` Archetypes are inalienable assets; task is to dissolve projections, not deny archetypes. → ¶160

## Section 3: The Mother-Complex (¶161-170)

### 3.0 Mother-Complex Foundation (¶161)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶161, Lines 2584-2593):

> [161] The mother archetype forms the foundation of the so-called mother-complex. In any event, the child's instincts are disturbed, and this constellates archetypes which produce fantasies that come between the child and its mother as an alien and often frightening element. Thus, if children of an overanxious mother regularly dream that she is a terrifying animal or a witch, these experiences point to a split in the child's psyche that predisposes it to neurosis.

**English Paraphrase**: Mother archetype = foundation of mother-complex. Disturbed instincts → constellate archetypes → fantasies come between child and mother. Terrifying animal/witch dreams = split in psyche → predisposition to neurosis.

**中文诠释**: 母亲原型 = 母亲情结的基础。受扰本能 → 激活原型 → 幻想介入孩子与母亲之间。恐怖动物/女巫梦 = 心灵分裂 → 神经症倾向。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_III_161]` `[trigger: mother_complex]` `[factor_trigger: jung_mother AND jung_complex]` `[role: 主干]` Mother archetype is foundation of mother-complex—disturbed instincts constellate archetypes that come between child and mother. → ¶161

### 3.1 Mother-Complex of the Son (¶162-166)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶162-166, Lines 2597-2653):

> [163] Only in the daughter is the mother-complex clear and uncomplicated. Here we have either an overdevelopment of feminine instincts indirectly caused by the mother, or a weakening of them to the point of complete extinction. In the first case, instinct makes the daughter unconscious of her own personality; in the latter, instincts are projected upon the mother.
>
> [166] All these possibilities are reflected in the mythological motifs enumerated earlier as different aspects of the mother archetype. Since I have dealt with the mother-complex of the son elsewhere, and my present theme is the archetype of the mother, in the following discussion I shall relegate masculine psychology to the background.

> [162] The effects of the mother-complex differ according to whether it appears in a son or a daughter. Typical effects on the son are homosexuality and Don Juanism, and sometimes also impotence. In homosexuality, the son's entire heterosexuality is tied to the mother in an unconscious form; in Don Juanism, he unconsciously seeks his mother in every woman he meets... Because of the difference in sex, a son's mother-complex does not appear in pure form. This is the reason why in every masculine mother-complex, side by side with the mother archetype, a significant role is played by the image of the man's sexual counterpart, the anima...
>
> [164] Since a "mother-complex" is a concept borrowed from psychopathology, it is always associated with the idea of injury and illness. But if we take the concept out of its narrow psychopathological setting and give it a wider connotation, we can see that it has positive effects as well. Thus a man with a mother-complex may have a finely differentiated Eros... This gives him a great capacity for friendship... He may have good taste and an aesthetic sense... He is likely to have a feeling for history... Often he is endowed with a wealth of religious feelings...
>
> [165] In the same way, what in its negative aspect is Don Juanism can appear positively as bold and resolute manliness; ambitious striving after the highest goals; opposition to all stupidity, narrow-mindedness, injustice, and laziness; willingness to make sacrifices for what is regarded as right, sometimes bordering on heroism; perseverance, inflexibility and toughness of will; a curiosity that does not shrink even from the riddles of the universe; and finally, a revolutionary spirit which strives to put a new face upon the world.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Homosexuality | Same-sex orientation | Heterosexuality tied to mother | Negative effect |
| Don Juanism | Serial seduction | Seeking mother in every woman | Negative effect |
| Differentiated Eros | Refined relatedness | Friendship capacity | Positive effect |
| Revolutionary spirit | World-changing drive | Heroic ambition | Positive effect |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

Jung analyzes **mother-complex in sons**:

**Typical negative effects**:
- **Homosexuality**: Entire heterosexuality tied to mother unconsciously
- **Don Juanism**: Unconsciously seeks mother in every woman
- **Impotence**: Sometimes occurs
- **Cybele-Attis pattern**: Self-castration, madness, early death

**Anima complication**:
- Son's mother-complex never appears in "pure form"
- Anima always plays significant role alongside mother archetype
- Mother is first feminine being for man—plays on his masculinity

**Positive effects** (beyond pathology):
- Finely differentiated Eros → great capacity for friendship
- Good taste, aesthetic sense
- Feeling for history, conservative values
- Wealth of religious feelings, spiritual receptivity

**Don Juanism's positive side**:
- Bold, resolute manliness
- Ambitious striving after highest goals
- Opposition to stupidity, injustice
- Willingness to sacrifice, bordering on heroism
- Revolutionary spirit

- **唐璜主义**：无意识地在每个女人中寻找母亲
- **阳痿**：有时发生
- **库柏勒-阿提斯模式**：自阉、疯狂、早夭

**阿尼玛并发症**：
- 儿子的母亲情结从不以"纯粹形式"出现
- 阿尼玛总是与母亲原型一起扮演重要角色
- 母亲是男性的第一个女性存在——作用于他的男性气质

**正面效应**（超越病理）：
- 精细分化的厄洛斯 → 强大的友谊能力

- 历史感、保守价值观
- 丰富的宗教情感、精神接受性

**唐璜主义的正面**：
- 大胆、果断的男子气概
- 追求最高目标的雄心
- 反对愚蠢、不公正
- 愿意牺牲，近乎英雄主义
- 革命精神

**Core Points**:
- Son's mother-complex: homosexuality, Don Juanism, impotence
- Anima always involved (never pure mother-complex in sons)
- Mother is first feminine being for male development
- Positive effects: differentiated Eros, friendship, aesthetics, spirituality
- Don Juanism positive: heroism, revolutionary spirit, ambition

### 3.2 Mother-Complex of the Daughter: Four Types (¶167-170)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶167-170, Lines 2657-2747):

> [167] (a) Hypertrophy of the Maternal Element.—The exaggeration of the feminine side means an intensification of all female instincts, above all the maternal instinct. The negative aspect is seen in the woman whose only goal is childbirth. To her the husband is obviously of secondary importance... Even her own personality is of secondary importance; she often remains entirely unconscious of it... She is content to cling to her mother in selfless devotion...
>
> [168] (b) Overdevelopment of Eros.—Quite the contrary, this instinct may be wiped out altogether. As a substitute, an overdeveloped Eros results, and this almost invariably leads to an unconscious incestuous relationship with the father. The intensified Eros places an abnormal emphasis on the personality of others. Jealousy of the mother and the desire to outdo her become the leitmotifs...
>
> [169] (c) Identity with the Mother.—If a mother-complex in a woman does not produce an overdeveloped Eros, it leads to identification with the mother and to paralysis of the daughter's feminine initiative. A complete projection of her personality on to the mother then takes place... The daughter leads a shadow-existence, often visibly sucked dry by her mother...
>
> [170] (d) Resistance to the Mother.—The motto of this type is: Anything, so long as it is not like Mother! On one hand we have a fascination which never reaches the point of identification; on the other, an intensification of Eros which exhausts itself in jealous resistance. This kind of daughter knows what she does not want, but is usually completely at sea as to what she would choose as her own fate.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Hypertrophy | Overgrowth | Excessive maternal | Type (a) |
| Overdeveloped Eros | Excessive relatedness | Father-bound | Type (b) |
| Identity with mother | Fusion | Paralysis | Type (c) |
| Resistance | Opposition | Counter-identification | Type (d) |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

Jung identifies **four types of daughter's mother-complex**:

**(a) Hypertrophy of Maternal Element**:
- Intensification of all female instincts, especially maternal
- Husband is secondary; childbirth is only goal
- Own personality unconscious—lives through others
- Like Demeter: possessive, will to power masked as devotion

**(b) Overdevelopment of Eros**:
- Maternal instinct wiped out; replaced by intense Eros
- Leads to unconscious incestuous relationship with father
- Jealousy of mother; desire to outdo her
- Attracted to married men to wreck marriages
- Remarkable unconsciousness of own actions

**(c) Identity with Mother**:
- Complete projection of personality onto mother
- Paralysis of feminine initiative
- "Shadow-existence, sucked dry by mother"
- Yet attractive to men (empty vessel for projections)
- Like Persephone abducted from Demeter

**(d) Resistance to Mother**:
- Motto: "Anything, so long as it is not like Mother!"
- Fascination but never identification
- Eros exhausted in jealous resistance
- Knows what she doesn't want; no idea of own fate
- Negative mother-complex par excellence

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

荣格识别**女儿母亲情结的四种类型**：

**(a) 母性元素肥大**：
- 所有女性本能强化，尤其是母性
- 丈夫次要；生育是唯一目标
- 自己人格无意识——通过他人生活
- 如德墨忒尔：占有欲、权力意志伪装为奉献

**(b) 厄洛斯过度发展**：
- 母性本能被消除；被强烈厄洛斯取代
- 导致与父亲的无意识乱伦关系
- 嫉妒母亲；渴望胜过她
- 被已婚男人吸引以破坏婚姻
- 对自己行为显著无意识

**(c) 与母亲认同**：
- 人格完全投射到母亲身上
- 女性主动性瘫痪
- "影子存在，被母亲吸干"
- 却对男人有吸引力（投射的空容器）
- 如珀尔塞福涅被从德墨忒尔那里劫走

**(d) 对母亲的抵抗**：
- 座右铭："只要不像母亲就行！"
- 着迷但从不认同
- 厄洛斯在嫉妒抵抗中耗尽
- 知道不想要什么；不知道自己命运
- 典型的负面母亲情结

**Core Points**:
- Type (a): Maternal hypertrophy—lives through children, possessive
- Type (b): Overdeveloped Eros—father-bound, marriage-wrecking
- Type (c): Mother identification—shadow existence, paralyzed
- Type (d): Mother resistance—knows only what she doesn't want
- All four types represent different distortions of feminine development

### 3.3 Resistance and Intellect Development (¶171)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶171, Lines 2764-2771):

> [171] Resistance to the mother can sometimes result in a spontaneous development of intellect for the purpose of creating a sphere of interest in which the mother has no place. This development springs from the daughter's own needs and not at all for the sake of a man whom she would like to impress. Its real purpose is to break the mother's power by intellectual criticism and superior knowledge, so as to enumerate to her all her stupidities, mistakes in logic, and educational shortcomings. Intellectual development is often accompanied by the emergence of masculine traits in general.

**English Paraphrase**: Resistance to mother → spontaneous intellect development. Creates sphere where mother has no place. Purpose = break mother's power by intellectual criticism. Accompanied by masculine traits.

**中文诠释**: 对母亲的抵抗 → 自发智力发展。创造母亲无处容身的领域。目的 = 用智力批评打破母亲权力。伴随男性特质出现。

## Section 4: Positive Aspects of the Mother-Complex (¶172-181)

### 4.1 The Divine Mother Image (¶172-176)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶172-174, Lines 2777-2840):

> [172] The positive aspect of the first type of complex, namely the overdevelopment of the maternal instinct, is identical with that well-known image of the mother which has been glorified in all ages and all tongues. This is the mother-love which is one of the most moving and unforgettable memories of our lives, the mysterious root of all growth and change; the love that means homecoming, shelter, and the long silence from which everything begins and in which everything ends... Mother is mother-love, my experience and my secret.
>
> [173] The archetype is really far less a scientific problem than an urgent question of psychic hygiene. Even if all proofs of the existence of archetypes were lacking... we would have to invent them forthwith in order to keep our highest and most important values from disappearing into the unconscious.
>
> [174] Whether he understands them or not, man must remain conscious of the world of the archetypes, because in it he is still a part of Nature and is connected with his own roots. A view of the world or a social order that cuts him off from the primordial images of life not only is no culture at all but, in increasing degree, is a prison or a stable.
>
> [175] This excursion into the realm of generalities was unavoidable, because the mother is the first world of the child and the last world of the adult. We are all wrapped as her children in the mantle of this great Isis. In a man, the mother-complex is never "pure"—it is always mixed with the anima archetype.
>
> [176] The overdeveloped Eros type has positive aspects society could ill afford to do without. This type often develops in reaction to a mother who is wholly a thrall of nature, purely instinctive and all-devouring. The reactive intensification of the daughter's Eros is aimed at rescuing some man from the preponderance of the female-maternal element in his life.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Mother-love | Maternal affection | Mysterious root of growth | Universal experience |
| Mater natura/spiritualis | Mother nature/spirit | Totality of life | Beyond personal mother |
| Psychic hygiene | Mental health | Practical necessity | Why archetypes matter |
| Primordial images | Original patterns | Roots of being | Must stay conscious |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**The glorified mother**:
Mother-love is one of the most moving and unforgettable memories of our lives—the **mysterious root of all growth and change**; homecoming, shelter, the long silence from which everything begins and ends. Intimately known yet strange like Nature; lovingly tender yet cruel like fate; joyous giver of life—**mater dolorosa** and mute implacable portal that closes upon the dead. "Mother is mother-love, my experience and my secret."

**Do not load mother with archetype**:
We should not load that enormous burden of meaning—heaven and hell—onto one **frail and fallible human being** who was our mother. She carries for us the inborn image of **mater natura and mater spiritualis**, the totality of life. We must relieve the human mother of this appalling burden. This massive weight ties us to her and chains her to us—to the detriment of both.

**Archetypes as psychic hygiene**:
The archetype is less a scientific problem than an **urgent question of psychic hygiene**. Even if all proofs were lacking, we would have to **invent archetypes** to keep our highest values from disappearing into the unconscious. When they fall into unconscious, the whole elemental force is lost—we become fixated on mother-imago, tied to mere reason, condemned to doctrinairism.

**Remain conscious of archetypes**:
Man must remain conscious of the world of archetypes because there he is **part of Nature** and connected with his roots. A social order that cuts him off from primordial images is not culture but a **prison or stable**. The rational must be counterbalanced by the irrational. "The world exists only because opposing forces are held in equilibrium."

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**被颂扬的母亲**：
母爱是我们生命中最动人和难忘的记忆之一——**所有成长和变化的神秘根源**；归家、庇护、一切开始和结束的长久沉默。既熟悉又陌生如自然；既温柔又残酷如命运；生命的欢乐赐予者——**悲伤圣母**和向死者关闭的无言铁门。"母亲是母爱，我的经验和我的秘密。"

**不要让母亲承担原型**：
我们不应该把那巨大的意义负担——天堂和地狱——放在一个**脆弱易错的人**身上，她是我们的母亲。她为我们承载着**自然母亲和精神母亲**的先天意象，生命的整体。我们必须减轻人类母亲的这种可怕负担。这巨大重量把我们绑在她身上，把她绑在我们身上——对双方都有害。

**原型作为心理卫生**：
原型与其说是科学问题，不如说是**紧迫的心理卫生问题**。即使所有证据都缺乏，我们也必须**发明原型**以防止最高价值消失在无意识中。当它们落入无意识，原始经验的全部元素力量就丧失了——我们固定在母亲意象上，被绑在纯粹理性上，被判教条主义。

**保持对原型的意识**：
人必须保持对原型世界的意识，因为在那里他是**自然的一部分**并与他的根源相连。一个将他与原始意象切断的社会秩序不是文化，而是**监狱或马厩**。理性必须由非理性来平衡。"世界之所以存在，只因对立力量保持平衡。"

**Core Points**:
- Mother-love = mysterious root of growth, homecoming, silence
- Mother carries mater natura and mater spiritualis image
- Do not burden personal mother with archetype's weight
- Archetype = question of psychic hygiene, not just science
- Without archetypes, highest values fall into unconscious
- Then: fixation on mother-imago, doctrinairism
- Must remain conscious of archetypes to stay connected to roots

### 4.2 Consciousness and Conflict (¶177-179)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶177-179, Lines 2873-2908):

> [177] A woman of this type directs the burning ray of her Eros upon a man whose life is stifled by maternal solicitude, and by doing so she arouses a moral conflict. Yet without this there can be no consciousness of personality... I believe that, after thousands and millions of years, someone had to realize that this wonderful world of mountains and oceans, suns and moons, galaxies and nebulae, plants and animals, exists... The entire world round me was still in its primeval state; it did not know that it was. And then, in that one moment in which I came to know, the world sprang into being.
>
> [178] There is no consciousness without discrimination of opposites. This is the paternal principle, the Logos, which eternally struggles to extricate itself from the primal warmth and primal darkness of the maternal womb; in a word, from unconsciousness. Divine curiosity yearns to be born and does not shrink from conflict, suffering, or sin. Unconsciousness is the primal sin, evil itself, for the Logos.
>
> [179] Conflict engenders fire, the fire of affects and emotions, and like every other fire it has two aspects, that of combustion and that of creating light... Emotion is the chief source of consciousness. There is no change from darkness to light or from inertia to movement without emotion.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Athi plains vision | African experience | Consciousness creates world | Jung's confession |
| Logos | Word/reason | Paternal principle | Discriminates opposites |
| Matricide | Killing mother | Liberation from unconscious | Spirit's first act |
| Emotion as fire | Affect creates light | Source of consciousness | Change requires it |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Why consciousness matters**:
Moral conflict is necessary for consciousness of personality. Jung's confession of faith: after millions of years, **someone had to realize** this wonderful world exists. On the Athi plains of East Africa, watching wild herds in primeval stillness, he felt like the first man to know that **all this is**. "The world was still in its primeval state; it did not know that it was. And then, in that one moment in which I came to know, **the world sprang into being**." All Nature seeks this goal—fulfilled in the most conscious man.

**Logos vs Eros**:
There is no consciousness without **discrimination of opposites**. This is the **paternal principle, the Logos**—eternally struggling to extricate itself from the primal darkness of the maternal womb, from unconsciousness. Divine curiosity yearns to be born and **does not shrink from conflict, suffering, or sin**. For the Logos, **unconsciousness is the primal sin**, evil itself. Its first creative act of liberation is **matricide**—yet nothing can exist without its opposite.

**Emotion as source of consciousness**:
Conflict engenders **fire**—the fire of affects and emotions—with two aspects: combustion and creating light. Emotion is the **alchemical fire** that brings everything into existence and burns superfluities to ashes. **Emotion is the chief source of consciousness**. There is no change from darkness to light, from inertia to movement, without emotion.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**为何意识重要**：
道德冲突对于人格意识是必要的。荣格的信仰告白：数百万年后，**必须有人意识到**这个美妙的世界存在。在东非阿提平原上，观看在原初静默中的野生兽群，他感觉自己是第一个知道**这一切是**的人。"世界仍处于原初状态；它不知道它是。然后，在我认识到的那一刻，**世界跃入存在**。"所有自然都追求这个目标——在最有意识的人身上实现。

**逻各斯vs厄洛斯**：
没有**对立面的区分**就没有意识。这是**父性原则，逻各斯**——永恒地挣扎着从母性子宫的原初黑暗中解脱，从无意识中解脱。神圣的好奇心渴望诞生并**不畏惧冲突、苦难或罪**。对逻各斯而言，**无意识是原罪**，是邪恶本身。其第一个创造性解放行为是**弑母**——然而没有对立面就没有存在。

**情感作为意识之源**：
冲突产生**火**——情感和情绪之火——有两面：燃烧和创造光。情感是**炼金之火**，使一切存在并将多余烧成灰烬。**情感是意识的主要来源**。没有情感，就没有从黑暗到光明、从惯性到运动的转变。

**Core Points**:
- Moral conflict necessary for personality consciousness
- Jung's confession: someone had to realize the world exists
- "The world sprang into being" in that moment of knowing
- Consciousness requires discrimination of opposites (Logos)
- Logos struggles to escape maternal unconsciousness
- Unconsciousness = primal sin for Logos
- First creative act = matricide (liberation)
- Emotion = alchemical fire, chief source of consciousness
- No change from darkness to light without emotion

### 4.3 The Disturber, Empty Vessel, and Negative Complex (¶180-186)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶180-186, Lines 2910-2995):

> [180] The woman whose fate it is to be a disturbing element is not solely destructive, except in pathological cases. Normally the disturber is herself caught in the disturbance; the worker of change is herself changed, and the glare of the fire she ignites both illuminates and enlightens all the victims of the entanglement.
>
> [181] If a woman of this type remains unconscious of the meaning of her function, she will herself perish by the sword she brings. But consciousness transforms her into a deliverer and redeemer.
>
> [182] The woman of the third type, who is so identified with the mother that her own instincts are paralysed, need not remain a hopeless nonentity forever. If she is at all normal, there is a good chance of the empty vessel being filled by a potent anima projection. Such women may become devoted wives of husbands identified with profession or talent—Cherchez la femme, and you have the secret of his success.
>
> [183] Emptiness is a great feminine secret—the chasm, the unplumbed depths, the yin. Such a female is fate itself. A man falls, absurdly happy, into this pit, or if he doesn't, he has missed his only chance of making a man of himself.
>
> [184-186] The negative mother-complex type is an unpleasant partner who rebels against everything natural. But at her best she cultivates everything certain, clear, and reasonable. She may become the friend, sister, and competent adviser of her husband, with a human understanding transcending the erotic. She has the best chance for marriage success in the second half of life—if she overcomes the chaos of the maternal womb. A complex can only be overcome if lived out to the full.

**English Paraphrase**:
- Disturber is herself changed; fire illuminates all victims
- Unconscious disturber perishes; conscious becomes deliverer
- Empty vessel can be filled by anima projection → husband's success
- Emptiness = feminine secret, yin, fate
- Negative type: rebels against natural → but at best = adviser, friend
- Best marriage success in second half—if overcomes maternal chaos

**中文诠释**:
- 扰乱者自己也改变；火照亮所有受害者
- 无意识扰乱者灭亡；有意识者成为救赎者
- 空容器可被阿尼玛投射填满 → 丈夫的成功
- 空虚 = 女性秘密，阴，命运
- 负面类型：反抗自然 → 但最佳状态 = 顾问、朋友
- 后半生婚姻最成功——若克服母性混沌

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_III_180]` `[trigger: disturber_purification]` `[factor_trigger: jung_transformation AND jung_feminine]` `[role: 主干]` Disturber is herself changed; what seemed senseless upheaval becomes purification. → ¶180
- `[ns_cw9i_III_182]` `[trigger: empty_vessel]` `[factor_trigger: jung_anima AND jung_projection]` `[role: 主干依赖]` Empty vessel filled by anima projection—Cherchez la femme, secret of his success. → ¶182
- `[ns_cw9i_III_183]` `[trigger: feminine_yin]` `[factor_trigger: jung_feminine AND jung_yin]` `[role: 条件分支]` Emptiness is great feminine secret—the yin. Such female is fate itself. → ¶183
- `[ns_cw9i_III_184]` `[trigger: negative_marriage]` `[factor_trigger: jung_feminine AND jung_development]` `[role: 总结]` Negative type has best chance for marriage success in second half of life. → ¶184

## Section 5: Conclusion (¶187-198)

### 5.1 Archetype as Matrix and the Devil Problem (¶187-190)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶187-190, Lines 3022-3139):

> [187] All statements of mythology and observed effects of the mother-complex point to the unconscious as their place of origin. How else could man divide the cosmos into bright day-world and dark night-world unless he had the prototype in himself, in the polarity between conscious and unconscious?
>
> [188] The carrier of the archetype is first the personal mother, because the child lives in complete participation with her, in unconscious identity. As the distance increases, grandmother becomes "Great Mother"—wisdom and witch.
>
> [189] As distance between conscious and unconscious increases, opposites contained in the image split apart: good fairy and wicked fairy, benevolent goddess and malevolent. In the West, the morally ambiguous Yahweh became exclusively good God; everything evil united in the devil.
>
> [190] Western man has sunk so low that he must deny the divinity itself, so that after swallowing evil, he may possess the good as well. Nietzsche described with passion the "Superman" for whom God is dead—burst asunder trying to imprison the divine paradox within mortal man.

**English Paraphrase**:
- Mythology and mother-complex point to unconscious as origin
- Day-world/night-world = conscious/unconscious polarity in man
- Personal mother → grandmother → Great Mother (as archetype recedes)
- West split God into good (God) and evil (devil)
- Man swallowed evil → tries to possess good → becomes devil himself
- Nietzsche's Superman = tried to imprison divine paradox → burst asunder

**中文诠释**:
- 神话和母亲情结指向无意识为起源
- 白昼世界/黑夜世界 = 人内意识/无意识极性
- 个人母亲 → 祖母 → 大母神（原型退却时）
- 西方分裂上帝为善（上帝）和恶（魔鬼）
- 人吞噬恶 → 试图拥有善 → 自己成为魔鬼
- 尼采的超人 = 试图囚禁神圣悖论 → 自身崩裂

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_III_187]` `[trigger: cosmos_division]` `[factor_trigger: jung_unconscious AND jung_polarity]` `[role: 主干]` Mythology and mother-complex point to unconscious—man's cosmos division reflects conscious/unconscious polarity. → ¶187
- `[ns_cw9i_III_189]` `[trigger: god_split]` `[factor_trigger: jung_god AND jung_shadow]` `[role: 主干依赖]` West split God: Yahweh → exclusively good God; evil → devil. Man swallowed evil, became carrier of mysterium iniquitatis. → ¶189
- `[ns_cw9i_III_190]` `[trigger: superman_paradox]` `[factor_trigger: jung_inflation AND jung_god]` `[role: 条件分支]` Nietzsche's Superman tried to imprison divine paradox in mortal man—burst asunder. → ¶190

### 5.2 Mother-Image in Man vs Woman (¶191-194)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶191-194, Lines 3146-3200):

> [191] I have tried to give a survey of the psychic phenomena attributable to the predominance of the mother-image. When we ask patients influenced by the mother-image to express what "Mother" means to them, we invariably get symbolical figures which are direct analogies of the mythological mother-image.
>
> [192] The mother-image in a man's psychology is entirely different from a woman's. For a woman, the mother typifies her own conscious life as conditioned by her sex. But for a man the mother typifies something alien, filled with imagery latent in the unconscious. The mother has a decidedly symbolical significance for a man, which accounts for his strong tendency to idealize her. Idealization is a hidden apotropaism; one idealizes whenever there is a secret fear to be exorcized.
>
> [193] For a man the mother is ipso facto symbolical; for a woman she becomes a symbol only in the course of development. The Urania type predominates in masculine psychology; the chthonic Earth Mother is most frequent in women. A woman can identify directly with the Earth Mother, but a man cannot. The man identifies with the son-lover—puer aeternus or filius sapientiae. But the companion of the chthonic mother is an ithyphallic Hermes or lingam.
>
> [194] As soon as we touch on these identifications we enter the realm of the syzygies, paired opposites, where the One is never separated from the Other. It is a field leading directly to individuation, the attainment of the self. This realm is so entirely one of immediate experience that it cannot be captured by formula. The terrifying paradox of the primordial mother-image.

**English Paraphrase**:
- Man's mother-image ≠ woman's: for man = alien, symbolical, unconscious imagery
- Man idealizes mother = apotropaism (fear of unconscious)
- Man = Urania type; woman = chthonic Earth Mother
- Man identifies with son-lover (puer aeternus); woman with Earth Mother directly
- Syzygies → individuation → attainment of self
- Primordial mother-image = terrifying paradox

**中文诠释**:
- 男人的母亲意象 ≠ 女人的：对男人 = 异质的、象征性的、无意识意象
- 男人理想化母亲 = 驱邪（对无意识的恐惧）
- 男人 = 天王星类型；女人 = 地母类型
- 男人认同儿子-情人（永恒少年）；女人直接认同地母
- 配对 → 个体化 → 自性实现
- 原始母亲意象 = 可怕的悖论

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_III_192]` `[trigger: mother_alien]` `[factor_trigger: jung_mother AND jung_fear]` `[role: 主干]` Man's mother-image is alien, symbolical; his idealization is hidden fear of unconscious. → ¶192
- `[ns_cw9i_III_193]` `[trigger: urania_chthonic]` `[factor_trigger: jung_anima AND jung_animus]` `[role: 主干依赖]` Man = Urania type, identifies with puer aeternus; woman = chthonic, identifies with Earth Mother. → ¶193
- `[ns_cw9i_III_194]` `[trigger: syzygy_individuation]` `[factor_trigger: jung_syzygy AND jung_individuation]` `[role: 条件分支]` Syzygies lead to individuation—realm of immediate experience, terrifying paradox. → ¶194

### 5.3 Conclusion on Psychic Reality (¶195-198)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->

**Source Text** (¶195-198, Lines 3220-3280):

> [195] The psyche is an extremely complex phenomenon—it is not easy to make clear to oneself that the "soul" or "psyche" is no mere figure of speech but an empirical reality. The psyche is not just a matter of concepts, but living reality with powers of its own.
>
> [198] The archetype is purely formal, empty in itself—it is a "facultas praeformandi," a possibility of representation given a priori. But when it becomes conscious and is filled with individual experience, it becomes the image—vivid, living, and overwhelming. What we call "image" is the result of subjective and objective factors.

**English Paraphrase**:
- Psyche = empirical reality, not figure of speech
- Psyche has living powers of its own
- Archetype = purely formal, empty (facultas praeformandi)
- Filled with individual experience → becomes vivid image
- Image = result of subjective + objective factors

**中文诠释**:
- 心灵 = 经验现实，非修辞
- 心灵有自己的活力量
- 原型 = 纯形式的、空的（预形成能力）
- 填入个人经验 → 成为生动意象
- 意象 = 主观+客观因素的结果

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_III_195]` `[trigger: psyche_reality]` `[factor_trigger: jung_psyche AND jung_reality]` `[role: 主干]` Psyche is empirical reality with powers of its own—not mere figure of speech. → ¶195
- `[ns_cw9i_III_198]` `[trigger: archetype_formal]` `[factor_trigger: jung_archetype AND jung_image]` `[role: 总结]` Archetype = purely formal (facultas praeformandi); filled with experience becomes vivid image. → ¶198
