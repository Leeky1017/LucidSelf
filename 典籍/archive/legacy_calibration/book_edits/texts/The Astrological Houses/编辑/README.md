## Rudhyar's House Philosophy

**Core Distinctions**:

| Archaic Houses | Modern Humanistic Houses |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| 8 watches (3-hour periods) | 12 houses (30° sectors) |
| Clockwise (solar vitalistic) | Counterclockwise (psychomental) |
| Locality-centered | Globe-centered (geocentric) |
| Agricultural rhythms | Individual consciousness |
| Sun-dominant | Earth-Sun relationship |

**Philosophical Foundation**:
- **Houses = Terrestrial Space** (vs Zodiac = Celestial Space)
- **Earth's rotation** (daily cycle) vs **Earth's orbit** (yearly cycle)
- **Four Angles**: Horizon (Asc/Desc) + Meridian (MC/IC) = cross of matter
- **12-fold division**: Matches zodiac signs (but different meaning)

---

## Core Concepts to Extract

**House Theory** (7-10):
1. Locality-centered vs globe-centered astrology
2. Archaic 8 watches (vitalistic, clockwise)
3. Modern 12 houses (psychomental, counterclockwise)
4. Four Angles (Asc, MC, Desc, IC) - cardinal cross
5. Zodiac (celestial/orbital) vs Houses (terrestrial/rotational)
6. Sidereal vs Tropical zodiac debate
7. Monotheistic (Sun-centered) vs Pantheistic (space-centered) cosmology

**12 Houses Meaning** (12):
8-19. Houses 1-12 (Rudhyar's humanistic interpretation)

**Advanced Concepts** (1-3):
20+. House systems, cusps, hemisphere emphasis, etc.

## East-West Integration

**Rudhyar's Houses ↔ Eastern Concepts**:
- **Four Angles** ↔ 四正位/四正宫
- **Houses as life arenas** ↔ 十二宫/生活领域
- **Angular/Succedent/Cadent** ↔ 建除十二神/始中终周期
- **Hemisphere emphasis** ↔ 阴阳分布/上下半球
- **Locality-centered archaic** ↔ 地方时/本地坐标
- **Globe-centered modern** ↔ 全球视野/地心坐标
