### Ace of Cups

**Source Text**:
> "The waters are beneath, and thereon are water-lilies; the hand issues from the cloud, holding in its palm the cup, from which four streams are pouring; a dove, bearing in its bill a cross-marked Host, descends to place the Wafer in the Cup; the dew of water is falling on all sides. It is an intimation of that which may lie behind the Lesser Arcana. Divinatory Meanings: House of the true heart, joy, content, abode, nourishment, abundance, fertility; Holy Table, felicity hereof. Reversed: House of the false heart, mutation, instability, revolution."

**Core**: **Eucharistic Emblem & True Heart** – Divine hand from cloud holds cup with **four streams pouring**. **Dove with cross-marked Host descends** to place Wafer in Cup. Water-lilies, dew falling. Waite: **"Intimation of that which may lie behind Lesser Arcana"** (deeper spiritual meaning). House of true heart, joy, content, abundance, fertility; **Holy Table** (Eucharist). **Reversed**: False heart, instability.

**Chinese**: **圣餐徽章与真心之屋**——云中神手持杯，**四条流倾泻**。**鸽子衔十字圣体降下**放圣饼入杯。睡莲、露珠降落。韦特：**"暗示小阿卡纳背后可能之事"**（更深灵性含义）。真心之屋、欢乐、满足、丰盛、生育力；**圣餐桌**。**逆位**：虚假之心、不稳定。

- `[ns_waite_cups_003]` `[trigger: true_false_heart]` `[factor_trigger: waite_cups_ace AND polarity]` `[role: 条件分支]` Upright: true heart, content, abundance. Reversed: false heart, mutation, instability. → Polarity

### Two of Cups

**Source Text**:
> "A youth and maiden are pledging one another, and above their cups rises the Caduceus of Hermes, between the great wings of which there appears a lion's head. It is a variant of a sign which is found in a few old examples of this card. Some curious emblematical meanings are attached to it, but they do not concern us in this place. Divinatory Meanings: Love, passion, friendship, affinity, union, concord, sympathy, the interrelation of the sexes, and--as a suggestion apart from all offices of divination--that desire which is not in Nature, but by which Nature is sanctified."

**Core**: **Sacred Union & Caduceus** – Youth and maiden pledging. Above cups: **Caduceus of Hermes with lion's head between wings**. Love, passion, friendship, affinity, union, concord, sympathy, interrelation of sexes. Waite's mystical addition: **"that desire which is not in Nature, but by which Nature is sanctified"** (spiritual/sacred love transcending natural desire).

**Chinese**: **神圣结合与商神杖**——青年与少女承诺。杯上方：**赫耳墨斯商神杖，翼间狮头**。爱、激情、友谊、亲和、结合、和谐、同情、性别互动。韦特神秘补充：**"那不在自然中，但借此自然被圣化的欲望"**（超越自然欲望的灵性/神圣之爱）。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_waite_cups_004]` `[trigger: two_cups_waite]` `[factor_trigger: waite_cups_two]` `[role: 主干]` Two of Cups = sacred union; youth & maiden pledge; Caduceus with lion's head above. → Core
- `[ns_waite_cups_005]` `[trigger: sanctified_desire]` `[factor_trigger: waite_cups_two AND mystical]` `[role: 条件分支]` "Desire not in Nature, by which Nature is sanctified"—spiritual love transcending natural. → Mystical
- `[ns_waite_cups_006]` `[trigger: caduceus_symbol]` `[factor_trigger: waite_cups_two AND hermes]` `[role: 条件分支]` Love, passion, friendship, affinity, union, concord, sympathy; interrelation of sexes. → Meanings

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Sacred union and sanctified desire—love that transcends nature yet makes Nature holy
- **Natural Attributes**:
  - Symbolism: Youth and maiden pledging one another, two cups raised, Caduceus of Hermes rising above, lion's head between great wings
  - Characteristics: Harmonious, passionate, mutual, magnetised, marked by solemn pledge rather than casual attraction
  - Elements: Love, passion, friendship, affinity, union, concord, sympathy, interrelation of the sexes, desire "not in Nature" that sanctifies Nature
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Governs partnerships, covenants, romantic unions, and deep sympathies between two people
  - Expresses a form of desire that is more than instinctual—love that dedicates and consecrates the bond
  - Can mark significant encounters, reconciliations, or agreements where two lives are joined or renewed
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: Presence of two parties capable of genuine mutual exchange; a context where pledge, affection, or alliance can be given and received
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Equality of regard, shared intention, and commitment to treat the relationship as something sacred rather than merely convenient
  - **Nullifying Conditions**: One‑sided desire, hidden deceit, or distortion of longing that undermines concord and turns union into imbalance or broken agreement
- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - Literal Layer: Engagements, marriages, reconciliations, contracts or pacts between two people or groups
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of the sacred marriage—coniunctio that unites complementary forces under the caduceus and lion emblem
  - Practical Layer: Encourages tending to key relationships, forming healthy alliances, and recognising when a bond is meant to be honoured rather than kept casual
  - Psychological Layer: Inner integration of opposites (masculine–feminine, feeling–will), and the experience of desire that deepens and sanctifies rather than merely gratifies

It signifies also the side of excess in physical enjoyment, and the pleasures of the senses."

**Core**: **Celebration & Plenty** – Maidens in garden pledging with uplifted cups. Conclusion in plenty, perfection, merriment; happy issue, victory, fulfillment, solace, healing. **Reversed**: Achievement, end.

  - Characteristics: Festive, social, sensuous, light‑hearted, inclusive, oriented toward shared enjoyment

### Five of Cups

**Source Text**:
> "A dark, cloaked figure, looking sideways at three prone cups two others stand upright behind him; a bridge is in the background, leading to a small keep or holding. Divinatory Meanings: It is a card of loss, but something remains over; three have been taken, but two are left; it is a card of inheritance, patrimony, transmission, but not corresponding to expectations; with some interpreters it is a card of marriage, but not without bitterness or frustration. Reversed: News, alliances, affinity, consanguinity, ancestry, return, false projects."

**Core**: **Loss with Remainder** – Cloaked figure looking at three spilled cups; **two remain upright behind** (unseen). Bridge to keep in background (path forward exists). **"Loss, but something remains; three taken, two left."** Inheritance/patrimony **not corresponding to expectations**. Marriage with bitterness. **Reversed**: News, alliances, return.

**Chinese**: **有余之失**——披斗篷人物看三倾倒杯；**两杯在后直立**（未见）。桥通往堡垒（前路存在）。**"失落，但有余；三失，二留"**。继承/遗产**不符期望**。有苦涩婚姻。**逆位**：消息、联盟、归来。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_waite_cups_010]` `[trigger: five_cups_waite]` `[factor_trigger: waite_cups_five]` `[role: 主干]` Five of Cups = cloaked figure mourning; three spilled, two remain; bridge behind. → Core
- `[ns_waite_cups_011]` `[trigger: loss_remainder]` `[factor_trigger: waite_cups_five AND polarity]` `[role: 条件分支]` "Loss, but something remains; three taken, two left"—inheritance not meeting expectations. → Meaning
- `[ns_waite_cups_012]` `[trigger: bridge_forward]` `[factor_trigger: waite_cups_five AND path]` `[role: 条件分支]` Path forward exists (bridge to keep); reversed = news, alliances, return. → Hope

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Grief and partial loss—mourning what has spilled while failing at first to see what remains and the path ahead
- **Natural Attributes**:
  - Symbolism: Dark, cloaked figure looking at three prone cups, two upright cups standing behind, bridge in the background leading to a small keep or holding
  - Characteristics: Somber, turned toward loss, inward‑bent, preoccupied with what is gone, blind to remaining resources
  - Elements: Loss with remainder, inheritance and patrimony not corresponding to expectations, marriage with bitterness or frustration
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Processes disappointment when outcomes, inheritances, or relationships fall short of hope
  - Emphasises that something remains—two cups and a bridge—which can support renewal once grief has been acknowledged
  - Encourages a shift from fixation on the spilled cups toward recognising surviving bonds, resources, or paths forward
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: A genuine experience of loss or disappointment; some real remainder still present even if unnoticed
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Strong attachment to expectations, reluctance to let go of what was imagined, and habit of looking only at what is broken
  - **Nullifying Conditions**: Willingness to turn around, notice the two remaining cups and bridge, accept news or alliances that open a new chapter
- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - Literal Layer: Bereavement, divorce or separation, financial or familial disappointments, inheritances that feel less than promised
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of grief with remainder—soul standing between loss and the still‑available way across
  - Practical Layer: Call to honour sorrow without getting stuck, inventory what is left, and take concrete steps toward rebuilding
  - Psychological Layer: Tendency toward pessimism or regret, and the inner work of re‑orienting perception to include both loss and remaining hope

### Six of Cups

**Source Text**:
> "Children in an old garden, their cups filled with flowers. Divinatory Meanings: A card of the past and of memories, looking back, as--for example--on childhood; happiness, enjoyment, but coming rather from the past; things that have vanished. Another reading reverses this, giving new relations, new knowledge, new environment, and then the children are disporting in an unfamiliar precinct. Reversed: The future, renewal, that which will come to pass presently."

**Core**: **Past & Memories** – Children in old garden, cups with flowers. **"Card of past and memories, looking back on childhood"**; happiness from past, things vanished. Alternative: new relations/knowledge/environment (children in unfamiliar place). **Reversed**: Future, renewal, coming to pass.

**Chinese**: **过去与回忆**——旧花园孩童，杯盛花朵。**"过去与回忆之牌，回顾童年"**；来自过去的幸福，消逝之事。另解：新关系/知识/环境（孩童在陌生地）。**逆位**：未来、更新、即将发生。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_waite_cups_013]` `[trigger: six_cups_waite]` `[factor_trigger: waite_cups_six]` `[role: 主干]` Six of Cups = children in old garden; card of past, memories, looking back on childhood. → Core

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Nostalgia and memory—the sweetness of the past and its pull on the present, with potential for renewal
- **Natural Attributes**:
  - Symbolism: Children in an old garden, cups filled with flowers, familiar precincts suggesting earlier times
  - Characteristics: Gentle, childlike, innocent, tender, coloured by selective remembering and idealisation
  - Elements: Card of the past and of memories, looking back on childhood, happiness and enjoyment from what has vanished, alternative reading of new relations, knowledge, and environment
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Brings up childhood memories, past relationships, and old environments seeking emotional integration
  - Can indicate repeating or re‑creating old patterns in a new setting, or meeting people and situations that echo the past
  - When reversed or in future‑oriented contexts, turns toward renewal, new relations, and what will shortly come to pass
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: Emotional or situational links to the past—people, places, or themes that evoke earlier experiences
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Willingness to remember, sentimental mood, or external triggers such as reunions, old photographs, or returning to familiar locations
  - **Nullifying Conditions**: Refusal to engage with memory at all, or rigid clinging to nostalgia that blocks the movement toward future renewal
- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - Literal Layer: Reunions, returns to hometown or childhood places, reconnection with old friends or family, sharing stories of the past
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of the inner child and garden of memory—what in the psyche remains young, tender, and formative
  - Practical Layer: Opportunities to heal or re‑negotiate past patterns, to bring old gifts into a new environment, or to consciously let certain stories stay in the past
  - Psychological Layer: Balance between honouring nostalgia and stepping into the future; working with regression, attachment to "better times," and readiness for renewal

### Seven of Cups

**Source Text**:
> "Strange chalices of vision, but the images are more especially those of the fantastic spirit. Divinatory Meanings: Fairy favours, images of reflection, sentiment, imagination, things seen in the glass of contemplation; some attainment in these degrees, but nothing permanent or substantial is suggested. Reversed: Desire, will, determination, project."

**Core**: **Fantastic Spirit & Vision** – **"Strange chalices of vision, images of fantastic spirit."** Fairy favours, images of reflection, sentiment, imagination, **"things seen in glass of contemplation"**; some attainment **but nothing permanent or substantial**. **Reversed**: Desire, will, determination, project (manifestation).

**Chinese**: **幻想精神与异象**——**"奇异异象圣杯，幻想精神之像"**。仙女恩惠、反射之像、情感、想象，**"沉思之镜中所见"**；某些达成**但无永久或实质**。**逆位**：欲望、意志、决心、计划（显化）。

**Narrative Snippets**:

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Illusory options and fantasy—visions that fascinate but lack permanence or substance, versus focused desire that crystallises a project
- **Natural Attributes**:
  - Symbolism: Strange chalices of vision, each containing a different image rising from the cups, cloud‑like setting as if seen in vision or in a glass of contemplation
  - Characteristics: Dreamy, diffuse, multi‑imaged, enticing, unstable, difficult to grasp; imagination tends toward fantastic, unreal pictures
  - Elements: Fairy favours, images of reflection, sentiment, imagination, things seen in the glass of contemplation, some attainment but nothing permanent or substantial
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Indicates fantasising, day‑dreaming, wish‑casting, and being surrounded by tempting yet unreal or untested choices
  - Shows the mind or heart projecting images onto the future without sufficient grounding, so that achievements remain insubstantial
  - When reversed or consciously redirected, turns toward desire, will, determination, and the formation of a concrete project
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: A rich imaginal field and multiple possibilities, combined with limited clarity or commitment
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Escapism, indecision, over‑reliance on fantasy or divination without corresponding action, emotional overwhelm
  - **Nullifying Conditions**: Clear prioritisation, grounded testing of options, and alignment of desire with will that turns image into sustained effort
- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - Literal Layer: Many options, offers, or ideas on the table, some unrealistic; difficulty choosing or following through
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of the fantastic spirit—imagination projecting castles in the air and mirrored images that do not yet incarnate
  - Practical Layer: Need to sift visions, research possibilities, and choose one or a few realistic paths to develop into an actual project
  - Psychological Layer: Relationship to fantasy, avoidance, and projection; the work of integrating imagination with discipline so that vision can become life

### Eight of Cups

**Source Text**:
> "A man of dejected aspect is deserting the cups of his felicity, enterprise, undertaking or previous concern. Divinatory Meanings: The card speaks for itself on the surface, but other readings are entirely antithetical--giving joy, mildness, timidity, honour, modesty. In practice, it is usually found that the card shews the decline of a matter, or that a matter which has been thought to be important is really of slight consequence--either for good or evil. Reversed: Great joy, happiness, feasting."

**Core**: **Deserting Felicity & Decline** – Dejected man **deserting cups of his felicity/enterprise**. Surface: abandonment. Antithetical readings: joy, mildness, modesty. In practice: **"decline of matter, or matter thought important is really of slight consequence."** **Reversed**: Great joy, feasting.

**Chinese**: **放弃幸福与衰退**——沮丧男子**放弃其幸福/事业之杯**。表面：遗弃。相反解读：欢乐、温和、谦逊。实践中：**"事物衰退，或被认为重要之事实际微不足道"**。**逆位**：极大欢乐、盛宴。

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Voluntary departure and revaluation—walking away from cups that no longer matter as once believed
- **Natural Attributes**:
  - Symbolism: A man of dejected aspect turning his back on a carefully stacked arrangement of cups, departing across uneven terrain, often under a moonlit or dim sky
  - Characteristics: Somber, deliberate, inwardly resolved, carrying dissatisfaction and courage to leave
  - Elements: Deserting cups of felicity, enterprise, undertaking or concern; decline of a matter; recognition that a supposedly important matter is of slight consequence
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Shows leaving behind prior enterprises, relationships, or sources of happiness that no longer feel meaningful
  - Reveals that what once seemed central may, in practice, be of little real importance, whether for good or ill
  - Opens space for more authentic joy, mildness, honour, modesty, and—in reversal—great joy, happiness, and feasting
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: Realisation that existing cups do not satisfy or have lost significance; availability of a path, however unclear, away from the old arrangement
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Honest self‑assessment, willingness to accept decline of a matter, and courage to disrupt apparent security
  - **Nullifying Conditions**: Clinging to stale situations out of fear, or fleeing impulsively without insight, such that departure does not lead to wiser choices
- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - Literal Layer: Changing jobs, leaving relationships, relocating, or dropping long‑standing pursuits that no longer feel worth the cost
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of the pilgrim who turns from familiar cups toward an unknown landscape in search of deeper meaning
  - Practical Layer: Encourages reassessing priorities, downgrading what is of slight consequence, and consciously choosing what to abandon or retain
  - Psychological Layer: Inner movement away from old emotional dependencies or illusions of fulfilment, toward a quieter, more authentic joy

### Ten of Cups

**Source Text**:
> "Appearance of Cups in a rainbow; it is contemplated in wonder and ecstacy by a man and woman below, evidently husband and wife. His right arm is about her; his left is raised upward; she raises her right arm. The two children dancing near them have not observed the prodigy but are happy after their own manner. There is a home-scene beyond. Divinatory Meanings: Contentment, repose of the entire heart; the perfection of that state; also perfection of human love and friendship; if with several picture-cards, a person who is taking charge of the Querent's interests; also the town, village or country inhabited by the Querent. Reversed: Repose of the false heart, indignation, violence."

**Core**: **Rainbow Vision & Perfect Love** – Cups appear in rainbow, husband/wife contemplate in wonder/ecstasy. Children dance unaware, happy. Home-scene beyond. **"Contentment, repose of entire heart; perfection of that state; perfection of human love and friendship."** Also: town/country of Querent. **Reversed**: False heart's repose, indignation.

**Chinese**: **彩虹异象与完美之爱**——杯显于彩虹，夫妻惊叹/狂喜凝视。孩童跳舞未觉，快乐。家园场景在后。**"满足、全心安息；该状态之完美；人类爱与友谊之完美"**。也指：询问者之城镇/国家。**逆位**：虚假之心安息、愤怒。

Reversed: Taste, inclination, attachment, seduction, deception, artifice."
