### Ace of Swords

**Source Text**:
> "A hand issues from a cloud, grasping a sword, the point of which is encircled by a crown. Divinatory Meanings: Triumph, the excessive degree in everything, conquest, triumph of force. It is a card of great force, in love as well as in hatred. The crown may carry a much higher significance than comes usually within the sphere of fortune-telling. Reversed: The same, but the results are disastrous; another account says--conception, childbirth, augmentation, multiplicity."

**Core**: **Crowned Sword & Excessive Force** – Divine hand grasps sword, **point encircled by crown**. Triumph, **"excessive degree in everything,"** conquest, triumph of force. **"Card of great force, in love as well as in hatred."** **"Crown may carry much higher significance"** (spiritual authority). **Reversed**: Same but disastrous; or conception/childbirth/multiplicity.

**Chinese**: **加冠之剑与过度之力**——神手握剑，**剑尖被王冠环绕**。凯旋，**"一切中的过度"**，征服，力量的胜利。**"极大力量之牌，在爱与恨中皆然"**。**"王冠可能承载更高意义"**（灵性权威）。**逆位**：同样但灾难性；或受孕/诞生/增多。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_waite_swords_001]` `[trigger: ace_swords_waite]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_ace AND minor_swords_ace AND crown AND disaster]` `[role: 主干]` Ace of Swords = crowned sword; "excessive degree in everything"; triumph of force. → Core
- `[ns_waite_swords_002]` `[trigger: love_hatred_force]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_ace AND polarity]` `[role: 条件分支]` "Card of great force, in love as well as in hatred"—crown carries higher significance. → Meaning
- `[ns_waite_swords_003]` `[trigger: disastrous_reversal]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_ace AND reversal]` `[role: 条件分支]` Reversed: same force but disastrous; or conception, childbirth, multiplicity. → Shadow

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Natural Attributes**:
  - Symbolism: Hand issuing from a cloud grasping a sword, point encircled by a crown, the sword held upright in pure air
  - Characteristics: Penetrating, victorious, cutting, extreme; carries both clarity and the danger of excess
  - Elements: Triumph, excessive degree in everything, conquest, triumph of force, great force in love as well as in hatred, crown carrying higher significance
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Slices through confusion, hesitation, and falsehood with decisive mental power
  - Asserts truth and force of will, conquering obstacles through sheer intellectual or moral force
  - The crown hints at spiritual authority and justice beyond ordinary fortune‑telling—Air's highest expression
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: A situation requiring decisive mental action, clear judgment, or assertion of truth
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Moral clarity, alignment of intellect with higher purpose, and readiness to act on conviction

  - Literal Layer: Breakthroughs, legal victories, decisive communications, surgeries or cuts that resolve ambiguity
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of crowned intellect—the sword of truth that can both liberate and wound

### Two of Swords

**Source Text**:
> "A hoodwinked female figure balances two swords upon her shoulders. Divinatory Meanings: Conformity and the equipoise which it suggests, courage, friendship, concord in a state of arms; another reading gives tenderness, affection, intimacy. The suggestion of harmony and other favourable readings must be considered in a qualified manner, as Swords generally are not symbolical of beneficent forces in human affairs. Reversed: Imposture, falsehood, duplicity, disloyalty."

**Core**: **Blindfolded Balance** – Hoodwinked figure balances two swords. Conformity, equipoise, courage, concord **"in state of arms"**; or tenderness/affection. Waite's caveat: **"Harmony must be considered in qualified manner, as Swords generally not symbolical of beneficent forces."** **Reversed**: Imposture, duplicity, disloyalty.

**Chinese**: **蒙眼平衡**——蒙眼人物平衡两剑。顺从、平衡、勇气、和谐**"在武装状态"**；或柔情/亲密。韦特警告：**"和谐须限定考虑，因宝剑一般非仁慈力量象征"**。**逆位**：骗局、欺诈、不忠。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_waite_swords_004]` `[trigger: two_swords_waite]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_two]` `[role: 主干]` Two of Swords = hoodwinked figure balancing swords; equipoise, "concord in state of arms". → Core
- `[ns_waite_swords_005]` `[trigger: qualified_harmony]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_two AND caveat]` `[role: 条件分支]` Waite: "Harmony must be considered in qualified manner; Swords not symbolical of beneficent forces." → Warning
- `[ns_waite_swords_006]` `[trigger: duplicity_disloyalty]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_two AND reversal]` `[role: 条件分支]` Reversed: imposture, falsehood, duplicity, disloyalty. → Shadow

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Armed truce and suspended decision—tense equilibrium maintained under blindfold
- **Natural Attributes**:
  - Symbolism: Hoodwinked female figure balancing two swords upon her shoulders, sea behind, night or dusk atmosphere
  - Characteristics: Still, poised, guarded, defensive; harmony suggested yet inherently fragile and armed
  - Elements: Conformity, equipoise, courage, friendship, concord in a state of arms; tenderness, affection, intimacy; Waite's caveat that Swords are not beneficent forces
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Represents stalemate, guarded peace, or inner conflict held in check by refusing to look at the full situation
  - May indicate tenderness and intimacy constrained by defensive posture—love that dares not lay down its arms
  - Warns that "harmony" in Swords must be qualified; what looks like balance may be enforced silence or avoidance
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: A conflict or decision where two opposing forces are held in temporary equilibrium
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Deliberate choice to wait, need for information, or genuine diplomatic pause before action
  - **Nullifying Conditions**: Imposture, falsehood, duplicity, disloyalty—the blindfold becoming willful self‑deception or the balance collapsing into betrayal
- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - Literal Layer: Standoffs, negotiations, suspended decisions, or relationships in armed détente
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of the blindfolded balancer—equilibrium achieved by not seeing, not choosing, not confronting
  - Practical Layer: Encourages recognising when one is avoiding a decision; sometimes the truce serves, sometimes it stagnates
  - Psychological Layer: Inner defence mechanisms that hold opposing feelings in check; the question of when avoidance protects and when it prolongs pain

### Three of Swords

**Source Text**:
> "Three swords piercing a heart; cloud and rain behind. Divinatory Meanings: Removal, absence, delay, division, rupture, dispersion, and all that the design signifies naturally, being too simple and obvious to call for specific enumeration. Reversed: Mental alienation, error, loss, distraction, disorder, confusion."

**Core**: **Pierced Heart** – Three swords pierce heart, cloud/rain behind. Removal, absence, delay, division, rupture, dispersion. Waite: **"too simple and obvious to call for specific enumeration"** (self-evident suffering). **Reversed**: Mental alienation, error, confusion.

**Chinese**: **被刺之心**——三剑刺心，云雨在后。移除、缺席、延迟、分裂、破裂、分散。韦特：**"过于简单明显无需具体列举"**（不言自明的痛苦）。**逆位**：精神异化、错误、混乱。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_waite_swords_007]` `[trigger: three_swords_waite]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_three]` `[role: 主干]` Three of Swords = heart pierced; removal, absence, rupture, division. → Core
- `[ns_waite_swords_008]` `[trigger: self_evident_sorrow]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_three AND obviousness]` `[role: 条件分支]` "Too simple and obvious to call for specific enumeration"—archetypal heartbreak. → Meaning

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Heartbreak and sharp sorrow—the obvious, piercing pain of separation and loss
- **Natural Attributes**:
  - Symbolism: Three swords piercing a heart, clouds and rain in the background, stark and unmistakable imagery
  - Characteristics: Acute, cutting, storm‑laden; emotional centre directly wounded by mental forces
  - Elements: Removal, absence, delay, division, rupture, dispersion—Waite notes meaning is "too simple and obvious to enumerate"
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Signifies break‑ups, grief, removal, rupture, and all forms of painful division where the wound is clear
  - Represents the moment when truth cuts through illusion and the heart must feel its loss
  - Reversed, it shifts from external heartbreak to internal mental disturbance, alienation, and confusion
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: An event or realisation that pierces emotional defences—loss, betrayal, or painful truth
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Attachment, expectation, and vulnerability that make the wound deep rather than glancing
  - **Nullifying Conditions**: Numbness, denial, or dissociation that blocks grief; or healing and integration that transform sorrow into wisdom
- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - Literal Layer: Break‑ups, bereavements, painful separations, betrayals, surgeries of the heart (emotional or physical)
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of pierced heart—universal image of sorrow that needs no explanation
  - Practical Layer: Acknowledges pain as real and valid; encourages grieving rather than suppressing
  - Psychological Layer: The work of processing heartbreak, integrating loss, and eventually allowing the wound to teach rather than only to hurt

### Four of Swords

**Source Text**:
> "The effigy of a knight in the attitude of prayer, at full length upon his tomb. Divinatory Meanings: Vigilance, retreat, solitude, hermit's repose, exile, tomb and coffin. It is these last that have suggested the design. Reversed: Wise administration, circumspection, economy, avarice, precaution, testament."

**Core**: **Knight's Tomb & Hermit's Repose** – Knight effigy in prayer on tomb. Vigilance, retreat, solitude, **hermit's repose**, exile, tomb/coffin. **"These last suggested the design"** (tomb imagery primary). **Reversed**: Wise administration, circumspection, economy, precaution.

**Chinese**: **骑士之墓与隐士安息**——骑士雕像祈祷于墓上。警惕、退隐、孤独、**隐士安息**、流放、墓/棺。**"后者启发设计"**（墓意象为主）。**逆位**：明智管理、谨慎、节俭、防范。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_waite_swords_010]` `[trigger: four_swords_waite]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_four]` `[role: 主干]` Four of Swords = knight's effigy in prayer on tomb; retreat, solitude, hermit's repose. → Core
- `[ns_waite_swords_011]` `[trigger: tomb_design]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_four AND mortality]` `[role: 条件分支]` "Tomb and coffin suggested the design"—vigilance, exile, sacred rest. → Meaning
- `[ns_waite_swords_012]` `[trigger: wise_administration]` `[factor_trigger: waite_swords_four AND reversal]` `[role: 条件分支]` Reversed: wise administration, circumspection, economy, precaution, testament. → Fruit

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Sacred rest and withdrawal—hermit's repose in the shadow of mortality
- **Natural Attributes**:
  - Symbolism: Effigy of a knight in the attitude of prayer, lying at full length upon his tomb, three swords on the wall, one beneath
  - Characteristics: Quiet, still, enclosed, contemplative; tomb imagery suggests both death and deliberate withdrawal from action
  - Elements: Vigilance, retreat, solitude, hermit's repose, exile, tomb and coffin—design suggested by these last
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Calls for retreat, solitude, and vigilant rest after struggle or before the next engagement
  - Shows the knight's body at rest while the soul prays—inner work continuing even when outer action pauses
  - Reversed, it expresses wise administration, economy, circumspection, and precaution arising from that withdrawal
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: Exhaustion, overstimulation, or completion of a phase that requires recuperation before proceeding
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Willingness to step back, access to sanctuary or solitude, and inner discipline to use rest productively
  - **Nullifying Conditions**: Refusal to rest, denial of need for recovery, or stagnation where rest becomes avoidance of life
- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - Literal Layer: Convalescence, sabbaticals, meditation retreats, hospital stays, or periods of enforced stillness
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of the resting knight—the warrior who withdraws to the chapel or tomb to gather strength
  - Practical Layer: Encourages honouring the need for rest; planning, strategising, and conserving resources before action
  - Psychological Layer: Integration through stillness; processing grief, trauma, or exhaustion; the discipline of non‑doing

### Five of Swords

> "A disdainful man looks after two retreating and dejected figures. Their swords lie upon the ground. He carries two others on his left shoulder, and a third sword is in his right hand, point to earth. He is the master in possession of the field.

**Core**: **Hollow Victory & Degradation** – Disdainful man (victor) watches two defeated retreat, swords on ground. **"Master in possession of field."** Degradation, destruction, infamy, dishonor, loss. **Reversed**: Same; burial, obsequies (no relief in reversal).

  - Characteristics: Gloating, isolating, morally compromised; post‑battle but with no glory, only degradation
  - Elements: Degradation, destruction, revocation, infamy, dishonour, loss—reversed gives the same plus burial and obsequies
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Points to situations of moral compromise, disgraceful success, or triumph achieved through shameful means
  - Shows "winning" that leaves the victor isolated, resented, or diminished in honour
  - Reversed offers no relief—same energies carried into funerary or closing rites, suggesting the damage persists
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: A competitive or adversarial context where one party can dominate another
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Willingness to use unfair means, lack of concern for collateral damage, and environments that reward ruthlessness
  - **Nullifying Conditions**: Genuine reconciliation, acknowledgment of wrongdoing, or refusal to engage in degrading competition
- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - Literal Layer: Pyrrhic victories, bullying, office politics, legal wins that destroy relationships, or "getting even" at great cost
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of hollow victory—master of the field who holds swords but has lost honour
  - Practical Layer: Warns against winning at any price; encourages examining what is truly gained and lost
  - Psychological Layer: Inner gloating, shame, or guilt after dominating others; the shadow of competition and aggression

### Ten of Swords

**Source Text**:
> "A prostrate figure, pierced by all the swords belonging to the card. Divinatory Meanings: Whatsoever is intimated by the design; also pain, affliction, tears, sadness, desolation. It is not especially a card of violent death. Reversed: Advantage, profit, success, favour, but none of these are permanent; also power and authority."

**Core**: **Rock Bottom & Not Violent Death** – Prostrate figure **pierced by all ten swords**. **"Whatsoever intimated by design"** (self-evident). Pain, affliction, desolation. Waite clarifies: **"Not especially a card of violent death"** (despite appearance). **Reversed**: Advantage, profit, success **"but none permanent"**; power/authority.

**Chinese**: **彻底失败与非暴力死亡**——俯卧人物**被全部十剑刺穿**。**"设计所暗示之事"**（不言而喻）。痛苦、折磨、荒凉。韦特澄清：**"尤其不是暴力死亡之牌"**（尽管外观如此）。**逆位**：优势、利润、成功**"但无永久"**；权力/权威。

**Narrative Snippets**:

#### L2 Semantic Extraction

- **Theme**: Rock bottom and total defeat—end of a cycle where one is "pierced by all ten swords" yet not necessarily violently killed
- **Natural Attributes**:
  - Symbolism: Prostrate figure pierced by all ten swords, lying face down, dawn light on the horizon suggesting an ending that precedes new beginning
  - Characteristics: Final, stark, overburdened; no further swords can be added—the worst has already happened
  - Elements: Pain, affliction, tears, sadness, desolation; Waite clarifies "not especially a card of violent death"; reversed gives advantage, profit, success, power—but none permanent
- **Functional Symbolism**:
  - Marks an ending with pain, tears, and desolation—the collapse of a cycle, situation, or identity
  - Shows that when one has been pierced by all ten swords, there are no more to come; the worst is over
  - Reversed indicates a temporary upswing, favour, and power that cannot be relied upon to last
- **Conditional Structure**:
  - **Necessary Conditions**: A situation that has reached its absolute low point or conclusion—complete defeat or ending
  - **Enhancing Conditions**: Accumulated stresses, unresolved conflicts, or denial that prolongs the collapse
  - **Nullifying Conditions**: Beginning of a new cycle—when rock bottom becomes foundation; acceptance that allows moving forward
- **Multi-layered Interpretation**:
  - Literal Layer: Total defeat, endings of projects or relationships, "hitting rock bottom," or receiving the worst news
  - Symbolic Layer: Archetype of the sacrificed figure—complete surrender to fate, with dawn suggesting eventual renewal
  - Practical Layer: Encourages accepting the ending rather than fighting it; prepares for the new cycle that follows collapse
  - Psychological Layer: Ego death, surrender, and the paradox that complete defeat can liberate one from what was being defended

### Knight of Swords

**Source Text**:
> "He is riding in full course, as if scattering his enemies. In the design he is really a prototypical hero of romantic chivalry. He might almost be Galahad, whose sword is swift and sure because he is clean of heart. Divinatory Meanings: Skill, bravery, capacity, defence, address, enmity, wrath, war, destruction, opposition, resistance, ruin. There is therefore a sense in which the card signifies death, but it carries this meaning only in its proximity to other cards of fatality. Reversed: Imprudence, incapacity, extravagance."

**Chinese**: **加拉哈德冲锋**——全速骑行，击散敌人。**"浪漫骑士典型英雄。几乎是加拉哈德，其剑迅捷准确因其心地纯洁"**。技能、勇敢、战争、毁灭、毁坏。**"仅在接近其他宿命牌时象征死亡"**。**逆位**：轻率、无能、奢侈。

### King of Swords

**Source Text**:
> "He sits in judgment, holding the unsheathed sign of his suit. He recalls, of course, the conventional Symbol of justice in the Trumps Major, and he may represent this virtue, but he is rather the power of life and death, in virtue of his office.

Reversed: Cruelty, perversity, barbarity, perfidy, evil intention."
