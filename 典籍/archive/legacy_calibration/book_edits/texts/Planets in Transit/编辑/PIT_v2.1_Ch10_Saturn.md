### 1. Saturn in the First House (土星过境第一宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 12219-12253):
> New beginning of internal growth. Responsibilities heavy but accomplishments may be great. Not good to start new long-range projects. Turn attention inward—just completed 14-year outward focus. Restructure yourself wherever necessary. Learn about yourself, not in others' terms. Time of introversion and introspection. May feel withdrawn and tired. Elaborate outer commitments may face trouble if distracting from inner work. Excellent for psychotherapy, human potential work, consciousness-raising. Unlearn incorrect ways of thinking about yourself.

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 12254-12283):
> Learn what is really important to you—psychological, spiritual, moral values may take precedence over material. Not necessarily financial loss, but may feel financially insecure. Control seems to be slipping. Work hard to keep things going. Avoid letting fear run your life—takes attention from restructuring value-system. Organize finances so don't have to pay much attention. Possessions reflect inner values—if unconscious, won't accurately reflect who you are. Discover your real needs. Be economical.

Need to understand to gain greater control over daily life. May need extensive changes. May have trouble with people in immediate environment, relatives, neighbors.

Greatest opportunity to make impression on world as individual. But can also be time of disaster—negative energies have consequences now. Nixon resigned during this transit.
