## 1. Transit Concept (行运概念)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "A transit occurs when a moving planet forms an aspect by degree to a point in the natal horoscope. The transiting planet activates the natal planet or point, bringing its symbolism into manifestation through external circumstances and internal psychological pressure. Transits are not events themselves but symbols of the intentions that create events."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
A **transit** is the fundamental mechanism of predictive astrology: a currently moving (transiting) planet forms an aspect—conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition—to a planet or point in the natal birth chart. This aspect creates an **activation**: the transiting planet's energy catalyzes the natal planet's inherent potential, bringing what was latent into manifest expression. Hand emphasizes transits are **symbolic, not causal**. They don't make events happen through external force but represent the natural timing when internal intentions and potentials ripen into external manifestation. The natal chart shows what you are (character, potentials, patterns); transits show **when** those patterns naturally tend to express themselves.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**行运**是预测占星的核心激活机制：一颗正在运行的行星（行运行星）在黄道上走到与本命盘中某个行星或关键点形成精确相位（合相、六合、四分、三分、对分）的位置时，就像按下了那颗本命行星对应的键——原本潜伏在性格与命局中的倾向被强行调到前台，要求被体验、被处理。汉德特别强调：行运本身并不"制造事件"，而是像表盘一样，标记出**内在意图与潜能成熟到需要外显的时间点**，具有强烈的象征性而非物理因果性。本命盘显示你是什么（性格、潜能、模式）；行运显示**何时**那些模式自然倾向于表达自己。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Transit**: `moving planet` / `aspect formation` / `activation trigger`
- **Activation**: `triggers latent potential` / `brings into manifestation` / `catalytic function`
- **Symbolic not Causal**: `timing not forcing` / `intention display` / `synchronistic`
- **Transit-to-Natal**: `personal activation` / `individual experience` / `natal potential`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Transit = moving planet aspects natal planet/point by degree
- Activation mechanism: external catalyst triggering natal potential into expression
- Symbolic not causal: represents timing of manifestation, not external forcing
- Transit-to-natal: personal activation (individual experience)
- Transit-to-transit: collective atmosphere (generation-wide influence)
- Timing principle: shows when natal potentials naturally express
- Natal chart = static (what); transits = dynamic (when)

**Detailed Explanation**:
The transit concept is foundational to all predictive astrology. While the natal chart is **static** (showing the permanent pattern at birth), transits are **dynamic** (showing how that pattern unfolds through time). This creates a two-layer interpretive system: natal potential (what) + transit timing (when). Imagine the natal chart as a keyboard with certain keys representing different potentials—career ambition (Saturn), relationship needs (Venus), aggressive drive (Mars), etc. Most keys remain silent most of the time. A transit is like a finger pressing a specific key—suddenly that potential sounds, becoming prominent in consciousness and circumstance.

## 2. Transits as Intentions (行运作为意图)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "Transits symbolize original intentions manifesting, not external fate. The horoscope is a map of intentions, not a prediction of events. Character is destiny. The person unconsciously intends certain experiences; transits show when those intentions naturally ripen into manifestation."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Hand's deepest philosophy reframes transits entirely: they are not **external fate** imposed by planets but **manifestations of original intentions**. Before birth or in early childhood, the soul/psyche forms intentions—patterns of what it needs to learn, experience, and become. The natal chart maps these intentions. Transits then show **when those intentions naturally ripen into external expression**. This radically shifts responsibility: you are not a victim of planetary forces but a conscious participant in your own unfolding. The phrase "character is destiny" captures this: your deep character (intentions) creates your life circumstances through synchronistic timing. When Saturn transits your Sun, you're not being punished by Saturn; you're meeting the maturation challenge you originally intended to face.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
汉德最深层的哲学是对行运的彻底重构：行运不是行星强加的**外部命运**，而是**原始意图的显化**。在出生前或幼年，灵魂/心理形成了意图——需要学什么、经历什么、成为什么的模式。本命盘映射这些意图。行运则显示**这些意图何时自然成熟为外部表达**。这从根本上转移了责任：你不是行星力量的受害者，而是自己展开过程中的有意识参与者。"性格即命运"这句话抓住了核心：你的深层性格（意图）通过同步性时机创造你的人生环境。当土星行运到你的太阳，你不是被土星惩罚，而是在遇见你原本打算面对的成熟挑战。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Original Intentions**: `pre-birth or early childhood` / `soul's curriculum` / `deep character pattern`
- **Manifestation not Fate**: `intention ripens` / `synchronistic timing` / `not external imposition`
- **Character is Destiny**: `deep character creates circumstances` / `responsibility shift` / `conscious participation`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Transits symbolize original intentions manifesting, not external fate
- Horoscope = map of intentions, not prediction of events
- Character is destiny: deep character creates life circumstances
- Person unconsciously intends certain experiences
- Transits show when intentions naturally ripen into manifestation
- Shifts responsibility from victim to conscious participant
- Raises consciousness through recognizing own intention

**Detailed Explanation**:
This philosophy transforms astrology from a fatalistic prediction system into a consciousness-raising tool. Instead of asking "What will happen to me?" the question becomes "What am I intending to learn through this transit?" This is profoundly empowering because it returns agency to the person. Even difficult transits (Saturn, Pluto) become understood as chosen learning experiences rather than cosmic punishments. The astrologer's role shifts from fortune-teller to guide helping the person recognize and cooperate with their own deeper intentions.

## 3. Psychological vs Event Orientation (心理vs事件取向)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "Modern astrology emphasizes psychological growth opportunities rather than external event prediction. Transits indicate appropriate times for actions and inner development, not inevitable external events. The focus shifts from 'What will happen?' to 'What am I being invited to become?'"

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The shift from **event orientation** (traditional fortune-telling) to **psychological orientation** (modern humanistic astrology) is fundamental to Hand's approach. Traditional astrology asks: "When will I marry? When will I get money? When will disaster strike?" This treats the person as passive, subject to external planetary forces. Modern psychological astrology asks: "What growth opportunity is this transit presenting? What inner work is being invited? How can I cooperate with this energy for my development?" This reframes transits as **invitations to growth** rather than **predictions of fate**. A difficult transit (Saturn square, Pluto conjunction) becomes not a threat but a **developmental opportunity**—a time when the universe is supporting your maturation if you engage consciously.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
从**事件取向**（传统算命）到**心理取向**（现代人本占星）的转变是汉德方法的基础。传统占星问："我何时结婚？何时有钱？何时会灾难？"这把人当作被动的，受行星力量支配的对象。现代心理占星问："这个行运呈现什么成长机会？邀请什么内在工作？我如何有意识地与这能量合作以促进发展？"这把行运从**命运预测**重构为**成长邀请**。一个困难的行运（土星四分、冥王合相）不是威胁而是**发展机会**——宇宙在支持你的成熟，如果你有意识地参与。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Event Orientation**: `external prediction` / `passive victim` / `fortune-telling`
- **Psychological Orientation**: `inner growth` / `active participation` / `developmental opportunity`
- **Appropriate Times**: `timing for action` / `readiness markers` / `not inevitabilities`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Modern approach emphasizes psychological growth vs external event prediction
- Transits indicate appropriate times for actions and inner development
- Shifts focus from "What will happen?" to "What am I invited to become?"
- Difficult transits become developmental opportunities, not threats
- Person shifts from passive victim to active participant
- Empowerment through recognizing growth invitations
- Cooperation with energy rather than submission to fate

**Detailed Explanation**:
This orientation change has profound practical implications. In event-oriented astrology, a client hears "Pluto is coming to your Sun—prepare for crisis." In psychological astrology, the same transit becomes "Pluto is inviting deep transformation of your core identity—what needs to die and be reborn?" The first creates anxiety; the second creates engagement. The astrologer's role shifts from predictor to guide, helping clients recognize and cooperate with growth opportunities.

## 4. Orb (Effective Range) (容许度)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "The orb is the degree range before and after an exact aspect within which the transit effect is felt. Typically 1-3 degrees for outer planets, wider for inner planets. The orb determines the duration of the transit's influence and marks the beginning and end of the effective period."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The **orb** is a technical but crucial parameter in transit interpretation: it defines the **effective range** (in degrees of arc) within which a transit aspect begins to be felt and continues to influence. An aspect is "exact" when the planets are at the precise degree; the orb extends before and after this exactitude. For **outer planets** (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto), the typical orb is **1–3 degrees**—meaning Saturn's influence begins about 1–3 degrees before exact conjunction and continues 1–3 degrees after. For **inner planets** (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars), the orb is typically **wider**, sometimes 5–8 degrees, because these planets move faster and their effects are more immediate. The orb determines the **duration** of the transit: a Saturn transit with a 2-degree orb lasts roughly 2–3 weeks at exact, plus approach and departure phases, totaling several months of influence. Understanding orb is essential for **timing predictions** and knowing when a transit truly begins and ends.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**容许度**是行运解读中的技术性但关键参数：它定义了**生效范围**（以黄道度数计），在这个范围内行运相位开始被感受，并继续施加影响。相位"精确"是指行星处于精确度数；容许度则延伸到这个精确点之前和之后。对于**外行星**（土星、天王、海王、冥王），典型容许度是**1–3度**——意思是土星的影响在精确合相前约1–3度开始，在精确合相后1–3度继续。对于**内行星**（太阳、月亮、水星、金星、火星），容许度通常**更宽**，有时5–8度，因为这些行星运行更快，其效应更即时。容许度决定了行运的**持续时间**：一个土星行运，容许度2度，在精确点持续约2–3周，加上接近与离开阶段，总共数月的影响。理解容许度对**时间预测**和知道行运何时真正开始和结束至关重要。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Orb**: `degree range` / `effective period` / `before and after exact`
- **Outer Planets**: `1-3 degrees` / `slow-moving` / `longer duration`
- **Inner Planets**: `wider orb` / `faster-moving` / `immediate effect`
- **Duration**: `weeks to months` / `approach-exact-departure` / `timing marker`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Orb = degree range before/after exact aspect where transit effects felt
- Outer planets typically 1–3 degrees orb
- Inner planets typically wider orb (5–8 degrees)
- Orb determines duration of transit influence
- Marks beginning and end of effective period
- Approach phase: building intensity
- Exact phase: maximum intensity
- Departure phase: fading influence
- Essential for accurate timing predictions

**Detailed Explanation**:
The orb concept transforms transit prediction from a single moment (exact aspect) into a **temporal window** with three phases. The **approach phase** begins when the transiting planet enters the orb—the person starts feeling the transit's pressure, though often unconsciously. The **exact phase** is the peak intensity—the moment of maximum activation. The **departure phase** continues after exactitude as the influence gradually fades. Understanding this three-phase structure helps clients recognize when a transit is beginning (sometimes weeks before exact) and when it's truly finished (sometimes weeks after). This prevents both premature conclusions ("It's over!") and prolonged anxiety ("Will it ever end?").

## 5. Station (Stationary Point) (静止点)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "Station is the point where a planet appears motionless before and after retrograde motion. It marks the maximum intensity of the transit—energy is concentrated, breakthrough or breakdown most likely. Station is the turning point where the transit's direction reverses."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The **station** (or stationary point) is a critical moment in transit interpretation: it's the point where a **retrograding planet appears to stop moving** before reversing direction. Due to Earth's orbital perspective, outer planets periodically appear to move backward (retrograde) in the zodiac. Just before turning retrograde and just after resuming direct motion, the planet appears **stationary**—motionless for a day or two. This apparent stillness represents **maximum concentration of energy**. Hand emphasizes that station is the **peak intensity point** of a transit: the pressure is greatest, the activation most acute. Psychologically, station often marks a **turning point or crisis moment**—a breakthrough (sudden clarity, decision, action) or breakdown (collapse, confrontation, forced change). Because energy is concentrated rather than flowing, station transits are often the most memorable and impactful moments in a transit cycle. A Saturn station might coincide with a major life decision; a Pluto station with a profound psychological transformation.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**静止点**（或称静止位置）是行运解读中的关键时刻：它是一颗**逆行行星在改变方向前后显现停止运动**的点。由于地球轨道视角，外行星周期性地在黄道上显现向后运动（逆行）。在转入逆行前和恢复顺行后，行星显现**静止**——一两天内不动。这种表观的静止代表**能量的最大集中**。汉德强调，静止点是行运的**最大强度点**：压力最大，激活最急。心理上，静止点常常标记**转折点或危机时刻**——突破（突然清晰、决定、行动）或崩溃（瓦解、对抗、被迫改变）。因为能量是集中而非流动的，静止点行运常常是行运周期中最难忘、最有影响的时刻。一个土星静止点可能与重大人生决定相吻合；一个冥王静止点与深刻的心理转化相吻合。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Station**: `apparent motionless` / `retrograde turning point` / `maximum intensity`
- **Retrograde**: `backward motion` / `Earth perspective` / `cyclical pattern`
- **Peak Intensity**: `concentrated energy` / `breakthrough/breakdown` / `turning point`
- **Crisis Moment**: `forced change` / `confrontation` / `transformation`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Station = point where planet appears motionless before/after retrograde
- Maximum intensity point of transit
- Energy concentrated rather than flowing
- Turning point or crisis moment often occurs
- Breakthrough (clarity, decision, action) or breakdown (collapse, confrontation)
- Most memorable and impactful moments in transit cycle
- Retrograde motion creates three-pass pattern (forward-retrograde-forward)
- Each pass deepens understanding and integration
- Station marks the reversal points in this cycle

**Detailed Explanation**:
Station is the **crescendo moment** in a transit's unfolding. While the approach phase builds pressure and the exact phase maintains intensity, the station concentrates all that energy into a single point. Psychologically, this often manifests as a **crisis or breakthrough**—a moment when you can no longer avoid the transit's issue, when something must give or transform. Clients often report that station moments coincide with major decisions, confrontations, or sudden insights. The retrograde cycle (forward-retrograde-forward) means the same transit aspect occurs three times over months, each pass deepening integration. Station marks the turning points in this cycle.

## 6. Retrograde Motion (逆行运动)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "When a planet appears to move backward (retrograde), it creates a triple-pass pattern: the planet aspects the natal point while moving forward, then again while retrograding, then a third time while resuming direct motion. This repetition forces deeper integration and review of unresolved issues."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
**Retrograde motion** is the apparent backward movement of planets as seen from Earth. Due to Earth's orbital perspective, outer planets periodically appear to reverse direction in the zodiac. When a transiting planet is retrograding, it creates a **three-pass pattern**: first pass (forward approach), second pass (retrograde), third pass (forward departure). This triple aspect means the same transit theme is reworked three times over months or years. Hand emphasizes this forces **deeper integration**—you can't ignore the issue after one pass; you must review, reconsider, and integrate more thoroughly. Retrograde transits are often more psychologically intense than direct transits because the repetition prevents superficial resolution.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**逆行运动**是行星从地球视角的表观向后运动。由于地球轨道视角，外行星周期性地在黄道上显现反向运动。当行运行星逆行时，它创造**三次经过模式**：第一次经过（顺行接近）、第二次经过（逆行）、第三次经过（顺行离开）。这个三重相位意味着同一行运主题被重做三次，跨越数月或数年。汉德强调这**迫使更深整合**——你不能在一次经过后忽视问题；你必须回顾、重新考虑并更彻底地整合。逆行行运常常比顺行行运心理强度更大，因为重复防止了表面解决。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Retrograde Motion**: `apparent backward` / `Earth perspective` / `cyclical pattern`
- **Triple-Pass Pattern**: `forward-retrograde-forward` / `three exact aspects` / `repetition`
- **Deeper Integration**: `forced review` / `unresolved issues` / `psychological intensity`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Retrograde = apparent backward motion from Earth's perspective
- Creates triple-pass pattern (forward-retrograde-forward)
- Same transit aspect occurs three times over months/years
- Each pass reworks the same theme
- Forces deeper integration and review
- Prevents superficial resolution
- Psychologically more intense than direct transits
- Unresolved issues come back for reconsideration

**Detailed Explanation**:
The retrograde cycle is nature's way of ensuring thorough processing. A direct transit might be resolved quickly; a retrograde transit keeps returning to the issue, demanding deeper understanding. Clients often notice that retrograde transits feel cyclical—the issue surfaces, seems to resolve, then resurfaces weeks or months later. This isn't failure; it's the retrograde pattern working as designed. Each pass deepens understanding and integration.

- `[ns_hand_pit_019]` `[trigger: retrograde_definition]` `[factor_trigger: astro_saturn_identity AND astro_saturn_maturity AND astro_retrograde_motion]` `[role: 主干]` Retrograde motion creates a triple-pass pattern: forward, retrograde, forward. → Source Text

## 7. Multiple Pass Pattern (多次经过模式)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "The three passes of a retrograding planet create a progressive deepening of understanding. Each pass adds layers of meaning and integration. The first pass introduces the theme, the second pass (retrograde) deepens it, the third pass consolidates the learning."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The **multiple pass pattern** describes how the retrograde cycle unfolds in three distinct phases, each with its own psychological character. The **first pass** (forward approach) introduces the transit theme—the issue first surfaces, often unconsciously. The **second pass** (retrograde) deepens the theme—now conscious, the person must engage more directly with the issue. The **third pass** (forward departure) consolidates learning—integration occurs, and the person moves forward with new understanding. This three-phase structure means major outer-planet transits can span 6–12 months or longer, with each phase requiring different psychological work. Hand emphasizes that **gradual adjustment** is the gift of the multiple-pass pattern—you're not forced to transform overnight but given time to integrate change.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**多次经过模式**描述逆行周期如何分三个不同阶段展开，每个阶段有其自己的心理特征。**第一次经过**（顺行接近）引入行运主题——问题首次浮现，常常无意识地。**第二次经过**（逆行）深化主题——现在有意识，人必须更直接地与问题互动。**第三次经过**（顺行离开）巩固学习——整合发生，人以新理解向前迈进。这个三阶段结构意味着主要外行星行运可以跨越6–12个月或更长，每个阶段需要不同的心理工作。汉德强调**逐步调整**是多次经过模式的礼物——你不是被迫一夜间转变，而是被给予时间来整合改变。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Multiple Pass Pattern**: `three phases` / `progressive deepening` / `gradual adjustment`
- **First Pass**: `introduces theme` / `unconscious surfacing` / `initial contact`
- **Second Pass**: `deepens engagement` / `conscious confrontation` / `active work`
- **Third Pass**: `consolidates learning` / `integration` / `moving forward`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Multiple pass pattern = three distinct phases of retrograde cycle
- First pass: introduces theme, often unconsciously
- Second pass (retrograde): deepens theme, requires conscious engagement
- Third pass: consolidates learning, integration occurs
- Each phase has different psychological character
- Spans 6–12 months or longer for major outer-planet transits
- Allows gradual adjustment to major changes
- Prevents forced overnight transformation
- Gives time for integration and understanding

**Detailed Explanation**:
The multiple-pass pattern is a mercy—it prevents shock and allows integration. Instead of a single overwhelming transit, you get three opportunities to work with the energy. First pass: "Something's shifting." Second pass: "I need to face this directly." Third pass: "I've integrated this; I'm moving forward." This rhythm respects human psychology and the time needed for genuine transformation.

## 8. Transit-to-Natal vs Transit-to-Transit (行运对本命vs行运对行运)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "Transit-to-natal aspects (transiting planet to natal planet) activate personal potential and represent individual experience. Transit-to-transit aspects (two transiting planets) create the collective atmosphere or cosmic weather affecting everyone born in that era similarly."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Hand distinguishes two fundamentally different types of transit aspects, each with different scope and meaning. **Transit-to-natal** (transiting planet aspects natal planet) is **personal activation**—the transiting planet triggers your specific natal potential. This is individual experience: your Saturn transit, your Pluto transit. **Transit-to-transit** (two transiting planets aspect each other) is **collective atmosphere**—the cosmic weather affecting everyone born in that generation. For example, when transiting Saturn squares transiting Uranus, everyone experiences that square's tension; the effect is collective, not personal. Hand emphasizes that **personal transits** (transit-to-natal) are what astrology clients care about—"What does this mean for me?" **Collective transits** (transit-to-transit) provide background context but don't directly activate individual charts unless they also aspect natal planets.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
汉德区分两种根本不同的行运相位类型，各有不同的范围和含义。**行运对本命**（行运行星与本命行星形成相位）是**个人激活**——行运行星触发你的特定本命潜能。这是个人体验：你的土星行运、你的冥王行运。**行运对行运**（两颗行运行星相互形成相位）是**集体氛围**——影响该世代所有人的宇宙天气。例如，当行运土星与行运天王星形成四分相，每个人都经历那个四分相的张力；效应是集体的，而非个人的。汉德强调**个人行运**（行运对本命）是占星客户关心的——"这对我意味着什么？"**集体行运**（行运对行运）提供背景语境，但除非它们也与本命行星形成相位，否则不会直接激活个人命盘。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Transit-to-Natal**: `personal activation` / `individual experience` / `natal potential trigger`
- **Transit-to-Transit**: `collective atmosphere` / `cosmic weather` / `generation-wide`
- **Personal vs Collective**: `individual scope` / `background context` / `direct activation`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Transit-to-natal = transiting planet aspects natal planet
- Personal activation of individual natal potential
- Individual experience: "What does this mean for me?"
- Transit-to-transit = two transiting planets aspect each other
- Collective atmosphere affecting entire generation
- Cosmic weather background context
- Transit-to-transit doesn't directly activate unless also aspects natal
- Personal transits are what clients care about
- Collective transits provide context but not direct impact

**Detailed Explanation**:
This distinction prevents confusion. A client asks, "What does Saturn square Uranus mean?" The astrologer must clarify: "Are you asking about transiting Saturn squaring your natal Uranus (personal), or about the current transiting Saturn-Uranus square (collective)?" The first directly affects you; the second affects everyone but doesn't specifically target your chart unless it also hits your natal planets.

## 9. Natal Aspect Modifies Transit (本命相位修改行运)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "A natal aspect between two planets colors and modifies the meaning of a transit between those same planets. For example, if your natal Sun is square Saturn, a transit of Saturn to your Sun will be experienced through the lens of that natal square—the transit trine becomes modified by the natal square's tension."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
**Natal aspects modify transits** is a crucial principle: the natal chart provides the **interpretive lens** through which all transits are filtered. If you have natal Sun square Saturn (lifelong tension between ego and limitation), a transit Saturn trine Sun won't feel like pure ease—it will be filtered through your natal square's pattern. The transit trine brings opportunity and ease, but your natal square means you'll approach it with caution, skepticism, or self-doubt. Conversely, if you have natal Sun trine Saturn (natural ease with structure), a transit Saturn square Sun will be less harsh because you have built-in structural competence. Hand emphasizes this **natal context principle**: every transit is interpreted through the natal chart's existing patterns. The natal chart is the **permanent filter**; transits are the **temporary catalyst**. Together they create the actual experience.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**本命相位修改行运**是一个关键原则：本命盘提供了所有行运被过滤的**解读透镜**。如果你有本命太阳刑土星（小我与限制之间的终身张力），一个行运土星拱太阳不会感觉像纯粹的轻松——它会被你本命相位的模式过滤。行运拱相带来机遇和轻松，但你的本命刑相意味着你会以谨慎、怀疑或自我怀疑的态度接近它。反之，如果你有本命太阳拱土星（与结构的自然轻松），一个行运土星四分太阳会不那么严厉，因为你有内置的结构能力。汉德强调这个**本命语境原则**：每个行运都通过本命盘的既有模式来解读。本命盘是**永久过滤器**；行运是**临时催化剂**。一起它们创造实际体验。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Natal Aspect**: `permanent pattern` / `lifelong theme` / `interpretive lens`
- **Transit Aspect**: `temporary catalyst` / `current activation` / `filtered by natal`
- **Modification**: `natal colors transit` / `context shapes meaning` / `lens effect`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Natal aspect between two planets modifies transit between same planets
- Natal chart provides interpretive lens
- Transit is filtered through natal pattern
- Natal aspect is permanent; transit is temporary
- Example: natal Sun-Saturn square modifies transit Saturn-Sun aspects
- Natal trine Saturn makes transit Saturn-square less harsh
- Natal square Saturn makes transit Saturn-trine less easy
- Natal context principle: all transits filtered through natal chart
- Together natal + transit create actual experience

**Detailed Explanation**:
This principle explains why the same transit affects different people differently. A Saturn transit to Sun is challenging for everyone, but someone with natal Sun-Saturn square has already learned to work with that tension; someone with natal Sun-Saturn trine must learn it fresh. The natal chart is your psychological baseline; transits activate and modify that baseline.

## 10. Saturn Cycle (29.5 Years) (土星周期)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "Saturn's approximately 29.5-year orbital period creates the fundamental maturation cycle in human life. Saturn rules structure, responsibility, limitation, discipline, and reality. Its cycle divides naturally into four 7-year quarters, each representing a developmental phase. The Saturn return at ages 29-30 and 58-60 marks major life restructuring periods."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The **Saturn cycle** (29.5 years) is astrology's primary **maturation cycle**, governing the progressive development from childhood through adulthood to elder wisdom. Saturn symbolizes **reality principle**: structure, limitation, discipline, responsibility, time, authority, ambition. Its transit cycle provides the fundamental timeline for psychological and social maturation. The cycle divides into **four 7-year quarters** (~7.4 years each): (1) **Crisis Quarter** (0-7.4): initial contact with limitation, structure begins; (2) **Action Quarter** (7.4-14.8): working with structures, building competence; (3) **Establishment Quarter** (14.8-22.2): consolidating achievements, mature structures; (4) **Transition Quarter** (22.2-29.5): preparing for next cycle, old structures dissolve. **Saturn returns** (ages 29-30, 58-60) are especially potent: Saturn returns to its natal position, completing one full cycle. These periods bring **reality confrontations**—what we built that lacks solid foundation crumbles; what's real and authentic strengthens. First return (late 20s) ends youth and demands adult responsibility. Second return (late 50s) brings legacy questions and elder wisdom. Hand emphasizes Saturn's 29.5-year cycle **exactly parallels** the Chinese **大运** (Great Fortune) 30-year cycle—one of the most precise East-West correlations in timing systems.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
在行运体系中，土星约 29.5 年一周的轨道，被视为**人类一生最重要的"成熟结构周期"**。它象征现实原则：结构、责任、限制、纪律与时间本身。汉德把这 29.5 年自然划分为四个约 7 年的阶段：从儿童第一次真实感受到"规则与边界"，到青少年学习在规则内行动，再到二十出头巩固自我与社会身份，最后在 30 岁前后对既有结构进行清算与重组。每一阶段都像一次"结构课"：不是马上给你成果，而是一点点训练你面对现实、承受压力、为自己的人生负责。其中最关键的是两次**土星回归**：第一次大约在 29–30 岁，当行运行土星回到本命土星的位置，意味着第一轮成熟循环的结算——那些虚浮、没有结构支撑的东西会在这一段时间内崩塌，真正有根基的部分会被保留下来并进一步强化，这也是"告别少年、正式成为大人"的经典节点；第二次大约在 58–60 岁，则把焦点从"建立人生"转向"如何收束与传承"，促使人重新评估自己这一生的结构是否值得留下、要以怎样的面貌进入老年阶段。汉德特别指出，这一 29.5 年循环与中国命理中的**大运 30 年**高度同构：两者都刻画"人生大的结构性更迭周期"，内部又往往细分为若干 7–10 年的小阶段。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Saturn Cycle**: `29.5-year orbit` / `maturation timeline` / `reality principle`
- **Four Quarters**: `7-year phases` / `developmental stages` / `crisis/action/establishment/transition`
- **Saturn Return**: `ages 29-30, 58-60` / `major restructuring` / `reality confrontation`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- 29.5-year cycle = one complete Saturn orbit = maturation cycle
- Four 7-year quarters: Crisis/Action/Establishment/Transition developmental phases
- Saturn return (ages 29-30, 58-60): Major life restructuring points
- Reality principle: Structure, responsibility, limitation, discipline themes
- First return (29): End youth, begin adult responsibility
- Second return (58): Legacy questions, elder wisdom
- East-West parallel: Precisely matches 大运 30-year cycle
- Ages 7/14/21/29/58 = major life structuring points
- What's real and authentic strengthens; what lacks foundation crumbles

**Detailed Explanation**:
The Saturn cycle is nature's curriculum for maturation. Each 7-year quarter teaches specific lessons: Crisis teaches you that limitations exist; Action teaches you to work within them; Establishment teaches you to build lasting structures; Transition teaches you to prepare for renewal. The Saturn returns are the exams—moments when everything you've built is tested for authenticity and durability.

## 11. Saturn Return (Ages 29-30, 58-60) (土星回归)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "Saturn return occurs when transiting Saturn returns to its natal position, completing one full 29.5-year cycle. This marks major life restructuring: the first return (ages 29-30) ends youth and demands adult responsibility; the second return (ages 58-60) brings legacy questions and elder wisdom."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
**Saturn return** is the most significant milestone in the Saturn cycle: the moment when transiting Saturn returns to its exact natal position. This occurs approximately every 29.5 years—first return around ages 29-30, second return around ages 58-60. Hand emphasizes that Saturn returns are **reality testing points** where everything you've built is examined for authenticity and durability. The **first Saturn return** (late 20s) is the classic "end of youth" moment—you can no longer hide behind youthful excuses; you must accept adult responsibility for your life. Structures that lack foundation crumble; authentic structures strengthen. The **second Saturn return** (late 50s) shifts focus from "building" to "legacy"—what have you created that's worth leaving behind? What needs to be released? Both returns are psychologically intense because Saturn demands honesty about what's real.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**土星回归**是土星周期中最重要的里程碑：行运土星回到其精确本命位置的时刻。这大约每 29.5 年发生一次——第一次回归约在 29–30 岁，第二次回归约在 58–60 岁。汉德强调土星回归是**现实考验点**，你建立的一切都被审视其真实性和耐久性。**第一次土星回归**（20 多岁末）是经典的"青春结束"时刻——你不能再躲在青年借口后面；你必须为自己的人生承担成人责任。缺乏基础的结构会崩塌；真实的结构会加强。**第二次土星回归**（50 多岁末）将焦点从"建立"转向"遗产"——你创造了什么值得留下？什么需要被释放？两次回归在心理上都很强烈，因为土星要求对什么是真实的诚实。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Saturn Return**: `natal position return` / `29.5-year cycle completion` / `reality testing`
- **First Return**: `ages 29-30` / `end of youth` / `adult responsibility`
- **Second Return**: `ages 58-60` / `legacy questions` / `elder wisdom`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Saturn return = transiting Saturn returns to natal position
- Occurs approximately every 29.5 years
- First return: ages 29-30
- Second return: ages 58-60
- Major life restructuring point
- Reality testing: what's authentic strengthens, what's false crumbles
- First return: end of youth, begin adult responsibility
- Second return: legacy questions, elder wisdom
- Psychologically intense period
- Demands honesty about what's real

**Detailed Explanation**:
Saturn returns are nature's exams. The first return tests whether you've built a life on authentic foundations or on fantasy. The second return tests whether your life has meaning and legacy value. Both are humbling moments that separate the real from the illusory.

## 12. Saturn 7-Year Quarters (土星7年季度)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "The Saturn cycle divides naturally into four 7-year quarters, each representing a distinct developmental phase: Crisis (0-7.4 years), Action (7.4-14.8), Establishment (14.8-22.2), and Transition (22.2-29.5). Each quarter teaches specific lessons about structure and responsibility."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The **Saturn cycle's four quarters** provide a detailed map of psychological development across the 29.5-year cycle. Each ~7-year quarter has its own character and teaching: (1) **Crisis Quarter** (0-7.4 years): First contact with limitation—the person learns that rules, boundaries, and structures exist. Childhood discipline, school structure, first real responsibilities. (2) **Action Quarter** (7.4-14.8 years): Working within structures—learning to function effectively within rules. Adolescence, building competence, developing skills. (3) **Establishment Quarter** (14.8-22.2 years): Consolidating achievements—building mature structures, establishing career/identity, adult relationships. (4) **Transition Quarter** (22.2-29.5 years): Preparing for renewal—old structures begin to dissolve, preparing for the next cycle. This quarter often brings restlessness and the impulse to break free from outdated patterns. Hand emphasizes that understanding these quarters helps explain why certain ages feel psychologically similar across different people—they're all in the same Saturn quarter.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**土星周期的四个季度**提供了跨越 29.5 年心理发展的详细地图。每个约 7 年的季度有其自己的特征和教学：(1) **危机季度**（0-7.4 年）：第一次接触限制——人学到规则、边界和结构存在。童年纪律、学校结构、第一次真实责任。(2) **行动季度**（7.4-14.8 年）：在结构内工作——学习在规则内有效运作。青少年、建立能力、发展技能。(3) **建立季度**（14.8-22.2 年）：巩固成就——建立成熟结构、建立职业/身份、成人关系。(4) **过渡季度**（22.2-29.5 年）：为更新做准备——旧结构开始溶解，为下一个周期做准备。这个季度常常带来不安和打破过时模式的冲动。汉德强调理解这些季度有助于解释为什么某些年龄在不同人身上感觉心理上相似——他们都在同一个土星季度。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Four Quarters**: `7-year phases` / `developmental stages` / `crisis/action/establishment/transition`
- **Crisis Quarter**: `first contact with limitation` / `structure begins` / `childhood discipline`
- **Action Quarter**: `working within structures` / `building competence` / `adolescence`
- **Establishment Quarter**: `consolidating achievements` / `mature structures` / `adult identity`
- **Transition Quarter**: `old structures dissolve` / `preparing for renewal` / `restlessness`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Saturn cycle divides into four ~7-year quarters
- Crisis Quarter (0-7.4): First contact with limitation, structure begins
- Action Quarter (7.4-14.8): Working within structures, building competence
- Establishment Quarter (14.8-22.2): Consolidating achievements, mature structures
- Transition Quarter (22.2-29.5): Old structures dissolve, preparing for renewal
- Each quarter teaches specific lessons about structure and responsibility
- Similar ages feel psychologically similar because they're in same Saturn quarter
- Explains developmental patterns across different people
- Provides psychological map for understanding life stages

**Detailed Explanation**:
The four-quarter model explains why a 14-year-old and a 21-year-old can feel so different psychologically—they're in different Saturn quarters with different tasks. A 7-year-old is learning rules exist; a 14-year-old is learning to work within them; a 21-year-old is consolidating identity; a 28-year-old is preparing to leave it all behind and start fresh. Understanding this helps astrologers guide clients through their current quarter's specific challenges.

> "Jupiter's 12-year orbital period creates the expansion and growth cycle. Jupiter rules opportunity, abundance, optimism, exploration, and philosophical expansion. The 12-year cycle divides into phases of expansion and consolidation, marking natural opportunity windows for growth and new ventures."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The **Jupiter cycle** (12 years) is astrology's primary **growth and expansion cycle**, governing opportunities, abundance, and philosophical development. Jupiter symbolizes **expansion principle**: opportunity, luck, abundance, optimism, exploration, wisdom, faith. Unlike Saturn's restrictive maturation, Jupiter opens doors and invites expansion. The 12-year cycle creates **natural opportunity windows**—periods when growth is favored and new ventures have better chances of success. Hand emphasizes that Jupiter transits are **fortune windows**: times when the universe seems to cooperate with your efforts. A Jupiter transit to your Sun or Ascendant often coincides with career advancement, relationship expansion, or spiritual growth. The cycle divides into phases: expansion (growth, new ventures, exploration) and consolidation (integrating gains, stabilizing). Understanding Jupiter's 12-year rhythm helps explain why certain ages (12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72) feel like natural opportunity points—Jupiter is returning to key natal positions.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**木星周期**（12 年）是占星学的主要**成长和扩展周期**，管理机遇、丰盛和哲学发展。木星象征**扩展原则**：机遇、幸运、丰盛、乐观、探索、智慧、信仰。与土星的限制成熟不同，木星打开门并邀请扩展。12 年周期创造**自然机遇窗**——成长受欢迎且新企业有更好成功机会的时期。汉德强调木星行运是**幸运窗**：宇宙似乎与你的努力合作的时期。木星行运到你的太阳或上升点常常与职业晋升、关系扩展或精神成长相吻合。周期分为阶段：扩展（成长、新企业、探索）和巩固（整合收益、稳定）。理解木星的 12 年节奏有助于解释为什么某些年龄（12、24、36、48、60、72）感觉像自然机遇点——木星正在回到关键本命位置。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Jupiter Cycle**: `12-year orbit` / `expansion principle` / `opportunity windows`
- **Expansion Phase**: `growth` / `new ventures` / `exploration`
- **Consolidation Phase**: `integrating gains` / `stabilizing` / `wisdom`
- **Fortune Windows**: `natural opportunity times` / `universe cooperation` / `luck`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Jupiter cycle = 12-year orbital period
- Expansion and growth cycle
- Opportunity, abundance, optimism, exploration themes
- Natural opportunity windows for growth
- Expansion phase: growth, new ventures, exploration
- Consolidation phase: integrating gains, stabilizing
- Ages 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 = natural opportunity points
- Jupiter transits often coincide with advancement and expansion
- Fortune windows: times when universe cooperates
- Contrasts with Saturn's restrictive maturation

**Detailed Explanation**:
Jupiter is the "yes" to Saturn's "no." While Saturn teaches through limitation, Jupiter teaches through expansion. A Jupiter transit is an invitation to grow, explore, and expand your horizons. The 12-year cycle means you get regular opportunity windows—roughly every 12 years, Jupiter returns to key natal positions, creating natural times for new ventures and growth.

## 14. Jupiter Return (Every 12 Years) (木星回归)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "Jupiter return occurs when transiting Jupiter returns to its natal position, completing a 12-year cycle. This marks the beginning of a new growth phase: fresh opportunities, philosophical renewal, and expansion into new areas. Jupiter returns occur at predictable ages: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
**Jupiter return** is the moment when transiting Jupiter returns to its exact natal position, completing one 12-year cycle and initiating a new one. Unlike Saturn returns which are reality testing points, Jupiter returns are **opportunity initiations**—moments when new growth cycles naturally begin. Hand emphasizes that Jupiter returns are **fortune windows**: times when the universe seems to open doors and create opportunities. The **first Jupiter return** (age 12) marks transition from childhood to adolescence—new learning opportunities, social expansion. The **second return** (age 24) marks transition to adulthood—career opportunities, relationship expansion. The **third return** (age 36) marks mature adulthood—wisdom and philosophical expansion. Each return brings **fresh opportunities** and invites **expansion into new areas**. Unlike Saturn's restrictive testing, Jupiter's returns are invitations to grow, explore, and expand horizons. The predictable timing (12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72) means you can anticipate opportunity windows and prepare to seize them.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**木星回归**是行运木星回到其精确本命位置的时刻，完成一个 12 年周期并启动新周期。与土星回归是现实考验点不同，木星回归是**机遇启动**——新成长周期自然开始的时刻。汉德强调木星回归是**幸运窗**：宇宙似乎打开门并创造机遇的时刻。**第一次木星回归**（12 岁）标记从童年到青少年的过渡——新学习机遇、社交扩展。**第二次回归**（24 岁）标记向成年过渡——职业机遇、关系扩展。**第三次回归**（36 岁）标记成熟成年——智慧和哲学扩展。每次回归都带来**新鲜机遇**并邀请**向新领域扩张**。与土星的限制性测试不同，木星的回归是邀请成长、探索和扩展视野。可预测的时机（12、24、36、48、60、72）意味着你可以预期机遇窗并准备抓住它们。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Jupiter Return**: `12-year cycle completion` / `opportunity initiation` / `growth phase beginning`
- **Fortune Windows**: `natural opportunity times` / `universe cooperation` / `expansion invitations`
- **Predictable Ages**: `12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72` / `life transition points` / `opportunity markers`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Jupiter return = transiting Jupiter returns to natal position
- Occurs every 12 years at predictable ages
- Ages 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 = opportunity windows
- Marks beginning of new growth cycle
- Fresh opportunities and expansion invitations
- Philosophical renewal and wisdom expansion
- Contrasts with Saturn's reality testing
- Fortune windows: times when universe opens doors
- Can anticipate and prepare for opportunities
- Each return brings new growth phase

**Detailed Explanation**:
Jupiter returns are nature's invitations to expand. While Saturn returns test what you've built, Jupiter returns invite you to build something new. The 12-year rhythm means you get regular opportunity windows—roughly every 12 years, Jupiter returns to key natal positions, creating natural times for new ventures, learning, and expansion.

## 15. Uranus Cycle (84 Years) (天王星周期)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Paraphrased from Hand):
> "Uranus's 84-year orbital period spans most of a human lifetime. Most people experience Uranus opposition (around age 42) rather than return. Uranus rules revolutionary change, liberation, awakening, and individuation. The Uranus cycle represents the mid-life crisis archetype and the need for authentic self-expression."

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The **Uranus cycle** (84 years) is astrology's **revolutionary and individuation cycle**, spanning most of a human lifetime. Uranus symbolizes **liberation principle**: revolutionary change, awakening, individuation, authenticity, rebellion against limitations, breakthrough. Unlike Saturn (maturation) or Jupiter (expansion), Uranus **disrupts and liberates**. The 84-year cycle is so long that most people never experience a Uranus return (which would occur around age 84). Instead, the most significant Uranus transit is the **opposition** (around age 42)—when transiting Uranus opposes its natal position. Hand emphasizes that the Uranus opposition is the **mid-life crisis archetype**: a moment of awakening when you ask "Is this all there is? Am I living authentically?" This often triggers rebellion against limitations, need for authentic self-expression, and life restructuring. The Uranus cycle represents the **individuation process**—becoming your true self rather than conforming to others' expectations. Revolutionary change, liberation from false identities, and breakthrough into authenticity are Uranus's gifts.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
**天王星周期**（84 年）是占星学的**革命和个体化周期**，跨越大部分人类一生。天王星象征**解放原则**：革命性改变、觉醒、个体化、真实性、反抗限制、突破。与土星（成熟）或木星（扩展）不同，天王星**破坏和解放**。84 年周期太长，大多数人永远不会经历天王星回归（大约 84 岁时发生）。相反，最重要的天王星行运是**对冲**（大约 42 岁）——当行运天王星与其本命位置相对时。汉德强调天王星对冲是**中年危机原型**：一个觉醒时刻，你问"就这样了吗？我在真实地生活吗？"这常常触发反抗限制、需要真实自我表达和生活重组。天王星周期代表**个体化过程**——成为你的真实自我而不是符合他人期望。革命性改变、从虚假身份的解放和突破到真实性是天王星的礼物。

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Uranus Cycle**: `84-year orbit` / `liberation principle` / `individuation process`
- **Uranus Opposition**: `age 42` / `mid-life crisis` / `awakening moment`
- **Revolutionary Change**: `liberation` / `authenticity` / `breakthrough`

**Core Points** (decomposed, no upper limit):
- Uranus cycle = 84-year orbital period
- Spans most of human lifetime
- Most experience opposition (~age 42) not return
- Revolutionary change, liberation, awakening themes
- Mid-life crisis archetype
- Uranus opposition marks major awakening
- "Is this all there is?" moment
- Rebellion against limitations
- Need for authentic self-expression
- Life restructuring and individuation
- Breakthrough into authenticity

**Detailed Explanation**:
The Uranus cycle is about becoming yourself. While Saturn teaches through limitation and Jupiter through expansion, Uranus teaches through disruption and liberation. The Uranus opposition around age 42 is often experienced as a crisis—a sudden need to break free from false identities, outdated patterns, and inauthentic living. This is not destruction for its own sake but liberation toward authenticity.

## 16. Uranus Opposition (Age 40-44) (天王星对冲)

**L1**: Uranus opposes natal Uranus around age 42 = mid-life awakening crisis. Rebellion against limitations, need for authentic self-expression, life restructuring. "Is this all there is?" moment. Breakthrough or breakdown possible. 天王星对冲本命天王星约42岁=中年觉醒危机。反抗限制、需要真实自我表达、生活重组。"就这样了吗?"时刻。突破或崩溃皆可能。

**L2**: Mid-life transformation point. Function: Authenticity demand, liberation from false self, identity crisis. Theme: Crisis as catalyst for breakthrough. East: 中年危机/大限转折/自我觉醒。

## 17. Neptune Cycle (~165 Years) (海王星周期)

**L1**: Neptune's 165-year cycle too slow for return in lifetime. Neptune square/opposition (ages ~40s/80s if reached) = spiritual/ideal dissolution tests. Dreams vs reality confrontation. Illusion dissolving, transcendence seeking. 海王星165年周期太慢无法一生回归。海王刑/冲(若达约40s/80s)=灵性/理想消融测试。梦想vs现实对抗。幻想消融、超越寻求。

**L2**: Dissolution and spirituality cycle. Function: Illusion dissolving, transcendence seeking, spiritual testing. Theme: Dreams meeting reality, ideals tested. East: 灵性考验/放下执念/梦幻消融。

---

## 18. Pluto Cycle (~248 Years) (冥王星周期)

**L1**: Pluto's 248-year cycle impossibly slow for return in lifetime. Pluto aspects in lifetime (if any) = transformation/death-rebirth/power themes. Collective/generational more than personal. Taboo-breaking, shadow confrontation. 冥王星248年周期不可能一生回归。一生中冥王相位(如有)=转化/死亡重生/权力主题。集体/代际多于个人。禁忌打破、阴影对抗。

**L2**: Transformation and power cycle. Function: Death-rebirth, power confrontation, shadow integration. Theme: Collective transformation, generational impact. East: 劫数/业力转化/脱胎换骨/权力转移。

## 19. Outer Planets = Generational (外行星=代际)

**L1**: Uranus/Neptune/Pluto move slowly, affect entire generations similarly. Personal impact depends on natal house/planet activation. Generational themes vs personal triggers. 外行星移动慢，相似影响整代人。个人影响取决于本命宫/行星激活。代际主题vs个人触发。

**L2**: Collective vs personal activation. Function: Generational themes + personal triggers, collective atmosphere + individual experience. Theme: Macro-micro relationship. East: 时代运/大势vs个人命/集体vs个人。

---

## 20. Inner Planets = Personal Triggers (内行星=个人触发)

**L1**: Sun/Moon/Mercury/Venus/Mars transit frequently (days/weeks/months). Trigger slower outer planet themes, provide timing details. Fast-moving catalysts for slow-moving themes. 内行星频繁行运(天/周/月)。触发慢速外行星主题，提供时机细节。快速催化剂触发慢速主题。

**L2**: Timing and catalytic function. Function: Catalyze outer planet potentials, provide precise timing, trigger activation. Theme: Inner planets as timing mechanism. East: 流日/流月触发流年/小运触发大运。

## 21. Aspect Types in Transits (行运中的相位类型)

**L1**: Conjunction (0°, intensification/activation), Opposition (180°, confrontation/polarity), Square (90°, friction/growth/challenge), Trine (120°, ease/flow/support), Sextile (60°, opportunity/facilitation). Same meanings as natal but time-limited. 合相(0°/强化激活)、冲相(180°/对抗极性)、刑相(90°/摩擦成长挑战)、拱相(120°/轻松流动支持)、六合(60°/机遇便利)。与本命相同含义但时限性。

**L2**: Aspect quality and challenge level. Function: Describes transit quality, determines ease/difficulty, shapes experience. Theme: Aspect type determines transit character. East: 刑冲合害吉凶性质/五行生克。

## 22. Transit Duration Principle (行运持续时间原则)

**L1**: Faster planet = shorter duration, more frequent. Slower planet = longer duration, deeper impact. Moon transits (hours/days), Mercury transits (weeks), Venus/Mars transits (weeks/months), Saturn transits (months-years). Duration hierarchy creates timing framework. 快行星=短时更频。慢行星=长时更深。月行运(数小时/天)、水星(周)、金星/火星(周/月)、土星(月-年)。时间层级创造时机框架。

**L2**: Duration hierarchy and timing framework. Function: Short triggers vs long themes, creates temporal structure. Theme: Time scale determines impact depth. East: 流日/月/年层级时间架构/时间尺度。
