> ~7-year period. Radically redefine your relationship to outside world. Old patterns broken down, people may be upset by changes. Old limitations no longer acceptable, need to change even if break away from past. Stultifying marriage/relationship may end; relationship allowing you to be yourself will be changed not destroyed. Drive for freedom—may seem pointless rebellion. Open to experiences never allowed before. Good time for astrology, yoga, human potential, consciousness-expanding techniques. If find it upsetting, ask what you're holding onto. Accidents sign of unconscious setting the stage. See what aspects are truly limiting.
