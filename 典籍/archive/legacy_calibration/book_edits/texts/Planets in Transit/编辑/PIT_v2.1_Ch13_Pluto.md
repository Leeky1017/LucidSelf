## Part 1: Pluto Transiting Houses (冥王星过宫)

### 1. Pluto in the First House (冥王星过境第一宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 18771-18794):
> Gradually reshape many aspects of personality. Get in touch with forces that shaped you. Gain greater control over unconscious drives—subconsciously directed urges, compulsions, irrational impulses. Greater control over how you project personality—relationships more rewarding. But challenges en route. Energies rising to control everything—could make relationships difficult. Chance to be positive or negative force for change. Negative if don't understand yourself—vehicle for blind, irrational ego forces, infantile primitive urges. If understand yourself well, complete rebirth of energy and effectiveness. Fortunately, driven to seek inner dimensions of life—attracted to mysteries and hidden aspects. May lead to astrology, yoga, occult whose purpose is total regeneration of self.

**English Paraphrase**: Reshape personality. Gain control over unconscious drives. Can be positive or negative force for change. If understand self, complete rebirth. Driven to inner dimensions—mysteries, occult, yoga, astrology for self-regeneration.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 重塑人格。获得对无意识驱动的控制。可以成为积极或消极的变革力量。如果理解自我，完全重生。被驱动到内在维度——神秘、神秘学、瑜伽、占星学用于自我重生。

### 2. Pluto in the Second House (冥王星过境第二宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 18795-18820):
> Values undergo complete metamorphosis—possessions on material plane and sense of values on psychological level. May include major changes in financial picture. Most upsetting: quite frequently begins with breakdown phase—get along with much less. Business might lessen, difficulty borrowing, change income source, invest money in property repairs. Material base will change—hard to count on accustomed income. Not doomed to poverty—temporary phase. If try to hold on, only slow down process. Attitude toward property may change completely—may see physical property not so important. Metaphysical and moral values may become more important—no longer seek to acquire material possessions. Only inner values within total control.

**English Paraphrase**: Values undergo metamorphosis. Major financial changes possible—often begins with breakdown phase. Not permanent poverty. If hold on, slow the process. May see property as less important. Inner values become central.

### 3. Pluto in the Third House (冥王星过境第三宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 18821-18854):
> Everyday contacts and communications take on heavier tone. Elements normally taken for granted—neighbors, relatives, daily business—now fraught with significance. Forced to examine day-to-day actions as never before. Great changes triggered by circumstances in immediate environment. Situations contended with for years may reach crisis point—beginning of deep psychological change and inner regeneration continuing many years. Examine everyday beliefs—ideas held true without question may be undermining life in subtle way. Not good to take anything for granted—repressed psychological tensions will surface. Difficult to keep problems buried. Acute self-questioning. Don't assume wrong about everything. Not taking for granted doesn't mean wrong—just became so used they no longer register. To be aware is to experience. Don't settle for superficial explanations—get close to inner workings. May become interested in psychology, yoga, occult studies. Changes of scene and short trips may trigger important far-reaching changes.

**English Paraphrase**: Everyday contacts take on heavy significance. Crisis points reached. Beginning of deep psychological change. Examine beliefs—repressed tensions surface. Acute self-questioning. Seek inner workings. May study psychology, yoga, occult. Short trips trigger changes.

### 4. Pluto in the Fourth House (冥王星过境第四宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 18855-18881):
> Tremendous psychological changes continue from 3H—now deeper, more internal and personal. Inner psyche, home, family, most personal areas affected. Psychological level: may deal at last with problems lived with since childhood. Issues from childhood reemerge—understand consequences as adult. No longer satisfied just to live with them—want change, and can change at most fundamental levels. Irrational compulsions and inappropriate childish behavior called into light. Excellent period for psychotherapy. Even without, will undergo tremendous inward changes. On exterior: home life may change tremendously—change of residence, extensive repair/remodeling, divorce/death/separations, tremendous change in family relationships. Relationships with parents likely to change—if overly dependent, may need to break away. May have power struggle with parents if they try to hold on. Changes need not be negative—certainly will be significant, new order will begin.

**English Paraphrase**: Deeper psychological changes. Home, family, inner psyche affected. Childhood issues reemerge—can change at fundamental levels. Excellent for therapy. Home life may change—residence, family structure, parent relationships. Power struggles possible. New order begins.

### 5. Pluto in the Fifth House (冥王星过境第五宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 18882-18915):
> Many consequences—fifth house rules recreation/amusement and children (re-creation of self). If have children, likely fateful period with them—not necessarily bad. Everything you do with them will have powerful effect later. Be careful, use common sense. Specifically: periods of tension—power struggles with children as you apply too much pressure or vice versa. If severe afflictions, can be dangerous period for children—don't take unnecessary risks with their health. Fifth also house of love affairs—early phase of relationship as opposed to serious commitment. With Pluto, love affair likely very heavy, emotionally intense. May regard relationships as fated—could distort sense of proportion. Beware of fascination with someone you know isn't good for you—subconscious playing tricks. Existing relationship will be very intense and go through complete change. Relationship in severe trouble unlikely to survive—if it does, will last forever. Fifth also creative self-expression—attracted to powerful, involving activities, even carrying risk, because want to experience everything intensely. Superficial doesn't attract.

**English Paraphrase**: Fateful period with children—be careful. Power struggles possible. Love affairs intense, heavy, fated—may distort proportion. Beware fascination with wrong person. Existing relationships transform or end permanently. Attracted to intense experiences and creative expression.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 与孩子的命运时期——要小心。可能有权力斗争。爱情关系强烈、沉重、命中注定——可能扭曲比例。警惕对错误的人的迷恋。现有关系转变或永久结束。被强烈体验和创意表达吸引。

<!-- L1_END -->

### 6. Pluto in the Sixth House (冥王星过境第六宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 18916-18947):
> Be very careful of health—likely to overstrain physically and pay inadequate attention to body's needs. Physical condition you haven't attended to may reach critical point. At most severe: complete physical breakdown—but only if completely ignore health needs. Can also indicate complete physical regeneration—adopt careful regimen to rebuild body. Good time for yoga or physical-spiritual body culture. Examine diet and how body reacts. Be careful of fad diets assuming everyone's needs identical or based solely on religious principles. Poor diet can lead to breakdown. Sixth also concerns work. Great changes in work—possibly complete change of job or career. May be difficult period of tension—Pluto creates tension with people in job, particularly bosses. May be compelled to look elsewhere. May change jobs frequently as you cast about for proper situation—may take years. May get into Plutonian work: tearing down to build anew, regenerative therapies, secret or subversive elements, secret projects.

**English Paraphrase**: Be careful of health—overstrain possible. Neglected conditions may reach crisis. Can indicate regeneration—yoga, diet examination good. Work may change completely—tension with bosses. May change jobs frequently seeking right fit. May work in Plutonian fields.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 小心健康——可能过度劳累。被忽视的状况可能达到危机。可以表示重生——瑜伽、饮食检查好。工作可能完全改变——与老板的紧张。可能频繁换工作寻找合适的。可能在冥王星领域工作。

<!-- L1_END -->

### 7. Pluto in the Seventh House (冥王星过境第七宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 18948-18985):
> Either all relationships and partnerships go through profound transformations, or life transformed through close encounter with another person. Includes marriage, partnerships, enemies, consultants, any one-to-one relationship. In marriage: profound change through or within relationship—may reach crisis requiring redefinition. Long-hidden tensions must be released. Not basically sound marriage/partnership probably won't survive. Not particularly good time to start partnership or marriage—energies make it difficult to settle into comfortable routine. In marriage, may operate under unconscious compulsions making it difficult to create structure in your interests. Some people need emotional intensity—for them, marriage okay. Encounters with professional consultants may bring significant life changes. Pluto transiting often coincides with psychotherapy—don't expect therapist to do all the work. Important to avoid power struggles with enemies—likely extremely nasty and destructive. If involved, expect opponent to use every sneaky device. Don't reciprocate—you wouldn't be successful. More likely to receive underhanded treatment than give it. People you encounter are mirrors of inner psychic impulses. Stop attributing everything to others—recognize you trigger encounters by subtle unconscious cues.

**English Paraphrase**: Relationships undergo profound transformation. Marriage may reach crisis. Not good to start new partnerships. Consultants may transform life. Avoid power struggles with enemies. People encountered are mirrors of inner impulses—you trigger encounters unconsciously.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 关系经历深刻转变。婚姻可能达到危机。不适合开始新的伙伴关系。顾问可能改变生活。避免与敌人的权力斗争。遇到的人是内在冲动的镜子——你无意识地触发相遇。

**Narrative Snippets**:

<!-- L1_END -->

### 8. Pluto in the Eighth House (冥王星过境第八宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 18986-19009):
> Pluto is "at home"—symbolism closely related to eighth house. Both relate to death and resurrection symbolically and literally. Issues of major transformation—even death, rebirth, regeneration—more significant than ever. Your own life not in great danger, but deaths of people around you may have important effect. Such a death may radically change circumstances or force confrontation about nature and meaning of your life. Concerns become quite deep. May become involved in occult or teachings about life and death. Difficult to accept explanations that don't get to very bottom of matter. Seeking answers to mysteries. On different level: can affect possessions and resources held jointly—spouse's finances, corporate finances. Major change may occur through these sources. Not good time to go into debt—indebtedness puts you under someone else's control. One possibility combining both themes: inheritance (if other transits and natal indications support).

**English Paraphrase**: Pluto at home. Death/rebirth themes significant. Deaths around you may change your life. Concerns become deep—seek mysteries. Joint finances may change. Avoid debt. Inheritance possible.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 冥王星在本宫。死亡/重生主题重要。周围的死亡可能改变你的生活。关注变得深刻——寻求神秘。共同财务可能改变。避免债务。可能有遗产。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_pit_pl008]` `[trigger: pluto_transit_house_8]` `[factor_trigger: astro_house_8 AND astro_deep_transformation]` `[role: 主干]` Death/rebirth themes significant. Seek mysteries. Joint finances change. Avoid debt. → PIT Ch13 Pluto-8H
<!-- L1_END -->

### 9. Pluto in the Ninth House (冥王星过境第九宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 19010-19045):
> Overall view of world will change considerably, often because of crises demonstrating invalidity of former views. At same time, ability to see and understand world in depth and wisdom in handling it will grow. No reason to fear—at worst maturing experience, at best transform you into far better human being. Strive to learn everything—knowledge will be extremely useful during Pluto transit of 10H which follows. Whatever your interests prior, will turn now to more profound subjects—relationship to people and universe, your role in general scheme. May turn to religion if it gives deep intimate experience. Pluto brings knowledge not through mind but through viscera—must be experience. Mystical and occult philosophies may attract. But remember experiences are extremely powerful—avoid becoming fanatically obsessed. Pluto tends to produce obsessions—may cram what you've learned down others' throats. Give others chance to keep own views. Since 9H concerned with larger social order, may become involved in group or movement wanting to transform society—probably not revolutionary, Pluto operates slowly and effectively. If difficult aspects, may cause troubles with law if not careful—if convinced of own righteousness, operate without considering others' ideas. Keep in mind context and appropriateness.

**English Paraphrase**: Worldview changes through crises. Wisdom and depth grow. Knowledge useful for 10H. Turn to profound subjects—religion, occult. Knowledge through visceral experience, not just mind. Avoid obsession. May join transformative movements. Watch for legal issues if self-righteous.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 世界观通过危机改变。智慧和深度增长。知识对第十宫有用。转向深刻主题——宗教、神秘学。通过内在体验而非仅仅头脑获得知识。避免执念。可能加入变革运动。如果自以为是要注意法律问题。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_pit_pl009]` `[trigger: pluto_transit_house_9]` `[factor_trigger: astro_transit_pluto AND astro_house_9]` `[role: 主干]` Worldview transforms. Wisdom grows. Seek profound subjects. Avoid obsession. → PIT Ch13 Pluto-9H

### 10. Pluto in the Tenth House (冥王星过境第十宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 19046-19073):
> Most important time—strive to achieve more than ever. Aim to make greatest possible mark on world—now is time, but only if truly found out who you are. If haven't found out, now is time. Pluto gives either power to achieve life goals or insight to find out what they truly are. If secure and knowing, opportunity for great success if heed warnings. If don't know goals, will probably change path—may change jobs often and spend years apparently lost while finding out what supposed to do. Pluto arouses ambitions, desire to take control and dominate—action can be ruthless. But people who act thus are often tragic—having thrown away humanity, discover they can expect no quarter from others who unite to oppose them. Essential to avoid wreaking havoc or bending ethics—Pluto's energies too powerful to play games with. Play fairly, according to rules, but pursue goals. Don't take shortcuts. If experiencing altering life direction side, don't get discouraged. May undergo considerable changes, feel you've become different person. Take all time needed to find right course—if hurry, get into another wrong place.

**English Paraphrase**: Most important time. Strive to achieve. Find out who you are. If secure, great success possible. If not, may search for years. Pluto arouses ambition—can be ruthless but tragic if throw away humanity. Don't take shortcuts or bend ethics. If changing direction, don't rush.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 最重要的时期。努力实现。找出你是谁。如果稳定，可能取得巨大成功。如果不是，可能搜索多年。冥王星唤醒野心——可能无情但如果抛弃人性则是悲剧。不要走捷径或违背道德。如果改变方向，不要急躁。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_pit_pl010]` `[trigger: pluto_transit_house_10]` `[factor_trigger: astro_transit_pluto AND astro_house_10]` `[role: 主干]` Most important time. Strive for achievement. Don't take shortcuts. Play fairly. → PIT Ch13 Pluto-10H

### 11. Pluto in the Eleventh House (冥王星过境第十一宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 19074-19104):
> Great changes in long-range goals and hopes for future. Kinds of people as friends will change. Activities once enjoyed may no longer appeal. Many goals once pursued not worth pursuing. Ideals will change—reflected in people you associate with and groups you identify with. Looking for quite different kind of friendship—not just people you feel at ease with, but intense encounters emotionally and otherwise. Some not pleasant—seeking to confront new dimensions of self through them. Friendships now have purpose in individual development, not casual encounters. One friendship in particular may change your life—you may meet someone affecting you so strongly entire course of life is changed. But that's what you've been seeking. Avoid associating just because powerful and persuasive. Desire for intense experiences shouldn't lead to friends guiding life into wrong paths. Danger of unconscious compulsions taking over. But equally possible to meet someone who can really act as guide and teacher. May become associated with group wanting to reform society. Avoid ruthless persons—with Plutonian energies could be dangerous. If present interest in positive reform sincere, may find others with same aims. Shallow old friendships may end, new ones formed. Doesn't matter as long as fulfill fundamental purposes: transformation through friendships and regeneration of goals.

**English Paraphrase**: Goals and friendships transform. Seek intense, purposeful friendships. One friendship may change your life. Avoid just following powerful people. May join reform movements. Shallow friendships end, new purposeful ones form.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 目标和友谊转变。寻求强烈、有目的的友谊。一段友谊可能改变你的生活。避免只是追随有权势的人。可能加入改革运动。肤浅的友谊结束，新的有目的的形成。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_pit_pl011]` `[trigger: pluto_transit_house_11]` `[factor_trigger: astro_transit_pluto AND astro_house_11]` `[role: 主干]` Goals and friendships transform. Seek meaningful connections. One friendship may change life. → PIT Ch13 Pluto-11H
<!-- L1_END -->

### 12. Pluto in the Twelfth House (冥王星过境第十二宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 19107-19144):
> Many ramifications. Prepares for Pluto transiting 1H—clears away old and hidden psychic garbage prior to complete rebuilding of self. First and most importantly: psychological effects. Similar to Pluto's 4H transit—brings up deeply buried aspects and forces you to confront them. In our interaction with people we try to hide aspects we've been taught not to approve of—yet energies leak out in subversive ways, undercut conscious intentions, do ourselves in without understanding. Pluto activates these patterns to point they can't be ignored. Unconsciously motivated actions can become extremely troublesome. Although intend to act one way, suddenly find yourself acting quite differently. Extremely important to understand unconscious energies and be willing to confront "bad" aspects of yourself. Can't go through adulthood with clearly childish subconscious behavior patterns. May have to recall and relive childhood events affecting you now. Feel free to call in any therapist who seems able to reach inside. Transit activates hidden side of external life too—relationships that failed, actions and behavior you don't wish to discuss even with yourself. Consequences may come back to haunt you. Face them honestly—only then will they cease to run your life. May have alienated someone unconsciously who tries to work against you—"secret enemies," though usually not really unknown, just have to confront own guilt feelings. Bring feelings into open. Secret enemies can't work against you in open—if completely honest, they may change heart toward you. Whatever situation, necessary to confront all hidden and unpleasant aspects. By avoiding them you've created situation where they control you. Only by facing honestly without guilt can you clear them away.

**English Paraphrase**: Prepares for 1H—clears psychic garbage. Deep psychological work—confront hidden aspects. Unconsciously motivated actions troublesome. Understand "bad" parts of self. Confront childhood patterns. External hidden elements return—face honestly. "Secret enemies" lose power when brought to light. Clear away what controls you.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 为第一宫做准备——清除心灵垃圾。深层心理工作——面对隐藏的方面。无意识驱动的行为令人烦恼。理解自我的"坏"部分。面对童年模式。外部隐藏元素回归——诚实面对。"秘密敌人"在被揭露时失去力量。清除控制你的东西。

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_pit_pl012]` `[trigger: pluto_transit_house_12]` `[factor_trigger: astro_transit_pluto AND astro_house_12]` `[role: 主干]` Clears psychic garbage. Confront hidden aspects. Face what controls you. Prepare for rebirth. → PIT Ch13 Pluto-12H

## Part 2: Pluto Aspects (冥王星相位)

### Pluto-Sun Aspects (流年冥王星与本命太阳相位)

#### Pluto Conjunct Sun (流年冥王星合本命太阳)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
> Time of great change—strive to accomplish ambitions as never before. Won't allow obstacles to prevent objectives. Can go far if handle skillfully—but pitfalls. Pluto is death and regeneration—elimination of old and outworn, birth of new higher order. You can be agent of this process. But two limitations: Pluto gives tremendous drive only for elimination of truly old and outworn, not anything you want. And as transcendental planet, energies not easily harnessed to unenlightened egotism. What you do should be for eventual betterment of everyone, not just yourself—you are steward of this energy, not owner. If use for purely selfish ends, provoke furious opposition, even violence. If try to remove structures not yet ready to pass, unable to make progress. Pluto signifies replacing old inferior state with new truly superior state—not arbitrary replacement.
