## Part 1: Sun Transiting Houses (太阳过宫)

### 1. Sun in the First House (太阳过境第一宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1671-1694):
> At this time of year, for approximately one month, you will be able to recharge yourself, so to speak, for the year to come. You will become more concerned with personal matters and less with the world at large. This period is self-centered in a positive sense in that it is born not of selfishness, but of a real need to look at yourself and find out what you need for further progress.
> 
> Because the Sun is the source of all energy in the horoscope and because the first house is the projection of your personality, this transit indicates a time when you can project yourself with more forcefulness than usual. It is an excellent time for making an impression on others, but you must be careful because you will not be especially sensitive to their needs. This is because of the self-centeredness mentioned above. You are wrapped up primarily in your own concerns and are likely to have a very subjective viewpoint on most matters. For this reason, you may find it difficult to work with others during this transit.
> 
> Under certain conditions this transit may also result in marital problems, but only if there are other, more serious transits. Nevertheless, this is not one of the best times for resolving marital conflicts.
> 
> You have a great need to express yourself now, and it is a valid need. No purpose will be served by denying all your own needs in favor of a misguided concept of duty. There are times, and this is one of them, when your first duty is to yourself, and if you don't fulfill that duty, you will be of little use to anyone else.

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Recharge**: literal = restore energy / symbolic = solar return to self / context = annual renewal cycle
- **Self-centered (positive)**: literal = focused on self / symbolic = legitimate self-attention / context = not selfishness but necessary introspection
- **First house**: literal = Ascendant house / symbolic = personality projection, physical self / context = how you appear to world
- **Forcefulness**: literal = strength of impact / symbolic = solar vitality amplified / context = enhanced personal projection
- **Subjective viewpoint**: literal = internal perspective / symbolic = ego-centered perception / context = reduced objectivity

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
When the transiting Sun passes through your first house (approximately one month annually, beginning at your Ascendant), you enter a period of personal renewal and self-focus. This is the solar energy returning to your house of self-identity, creating optimal conditions for recharging your vitality for the coming year. Hand emphasizes this self-centeredness is positive and necessary—not selfish but essential for self-understanding and future progress. The Sun as horoscope's energy source, combined with the first house as personality projection, creates a time of enhanced personal forcefulness. You can make strong impressions on others, but sensitivity to their needs diminishes. Your perspective becomes highly subjective, making collaborative work challenging. Marital tensions may surface if supported by other difficult transits, and this is not ideal for resolving partnership conflicts. The core message: your first duty during this transit is to yourself—fulfill this duty or you cannot serve others effectively.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
当流年太阳过境第一宫（每年约一个月，从上升点开始），你进入个人更新和自我聚焦的时期。这是太阳能量回归你的自我认同宫位，为来年的活力充电创造最佳条件。汉德强调这种「自我中心」是正面且必要的——不是自私，而是理解自我和未来进步所必需的。太阳作为星盘的能量源，结合第一宫作为人格投射之宫，创造了增强个人力量感的时期。你能给他人留下强烈印象，但对他人需求的敏感度降低。你的视角变得高度主观，使合作工作变得困难。如果有其他困难行运支持，婚姻紧张可能浮现，这不是解决伴侣冲突的理想时期。核心信息：在此行运期间，你对自己的首要责任是照顾自己——履行这个责任，否则你无法有效服务他人。

**Core Points**:
- Sun in 1st house = annual recharge period lasting ~1 month
- Self-focus is positive necessity, not selfishness
- Sun = energy source + 1H = personality projection → enhanced forcefulness
- Excellent for making impressions on others
- Reduced sensitivity to others' needs during transit
- Highly subjective viewpoint develops
- Collaborative work becomes challenging
- Marital problems possible if supported by other transits
- Not ideal time for resolving partnership conflicts
- Self-care is primary duty—neglecting it renders you useless to others
- This self-duty precedes duty to others

**Detailed Explanation**:
Hand presents the Sun's first house transit as the personal New Year within the annual solar cycle. The Sun's nature as life-giving energy combined with the first house's role as the window of self-expression creates a concentrated period of personal power. The advice to prioritize self during this time reflects Hand's psychological approach to astrology—recognizing that sustainable service to others requires a foundation of self-understanding and self-care. The warning about relationship difficulties stems from the natural tension between 1st house (self) and 7th house (partnership) axes. This transit's timing (one month annually starting from Ascendant) makes it predictable and plannable for personal development work.

### 2. Sun in the Second House (太阳过境第二宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1695-1718):
> At this time you should reflect upon your values and the things that you value. Traditionally the second house is the house of money and of moveable property, as opposed to real estate. In modern times we refer to it as the house of resources in general and of what we value, both abstract values and material objects. During this month-long transit you should examine your relationship to the resources of your life.
> 
> Do they serve your needs, or do you serve theirs? Many people, out of a misguided need for security, become so involved with their possessions that they cannot act freely for fear of damaging their own interests, that is, property interests. At this time you need to express yourself through your material and nonmaterial resources, using them to define you to yourself and others.
> 
> More than any other time, you now want to have greater control of your life through the things that you value. On the material level this may mean that you will acquire possessions in order to gain more control over your own life or over other people. On the psychological level it indicates a need to assert your value system. But remember that others have a right to their own values. You should stand up for your own, but not by obliterating someone else's.

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Values**: literal = what you consider important / symbolic = core worth system / context = both material and abstract
- **Resources**: literal = money, possessions / symbolic = all life assets / context = what you draw upon
- **Second house**: literal = house after Ascendant / symbolic = possessions, self-worth, values / context = what you own vs what owns you
- **Express yourself through resources**: literal = use possessions for self-definition / symbolic = values as identity expression / context = resources as self-extension
- **Value system**: literal = hierarchy of what matters / symbolic = psychological foundation / context = basis of choices

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The Sun's transit through your second house (approximately one month annually) brings focus to your values—both material possessions and abstract principles. Hand expands the traditional second house meaning from money and moveable property to encompass all resources and everything you value. This is a period for examining your relationship with these resources: do they serve you, or have you become their servant? Many people, driven by misguided security needs, become so attached to possessions that they lose freedom of action. During this transit, you should express yourself through your resources, using them to define your identity to yourself and others. You desire greater life control through what you value—materially this may manifest as acquisitiveness for control, psychologically as asserting your value system. Hand's warning: while you should stand up for your values, you must not obliterate others' right to their own values.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
太阳过境第二宫（每年约一个月）将焦点带到你的价值观——包括物质财产和抽象原则。汉德将传统第二宫含义从金钱和动产扩展到包含所有资源和你珍视的一切。这是审视你与这些资源关系的时期：它们在服务你，还是你成了它们的奴仆？许多人出于错误的安全需求，对财产过度依附以至于失去行动自由。在此行运期间，你应通过资源表达自己，用它们向自己和他人定义你的身份。你渴望通过你所珍视的事物获得更大的人生控制——物质层面可能表现为为了控制而获取财产，心理层面则表现为主张你的价值体系。汉德的警告：虽然你应该坚持自己的价值观，但不能抹杀他人拥有自己价值观的权利。

**Core Points**:
- Second house = values (material and abstract) + resources + possessions
- Traditional meaning: money and moveable property (not real estate)
- Modern meaning: all resources and what we value
- Examine: do resources serve you, or do you serve them?
- Misguided security need can create possession-bondage
- Express yourself through material and nonmaterial resources
- Resources define identity to self and others
- Desire for greater control through valued things
- Material level: acquisition for control
- Psychological level: value system assertion
- Warning: respect others' right to their own values

**Detailed Explanation**:
Hand's interpretation of the second house transit reflects modern psychological astrology's evolution beyond simple material meanings. The question "do they serve your needs, or do you serve theirs?" captures the second house's shadow potential—becoming possessed by possessions. The psychological layer (value system assertion) is as important as the material layer (acquisition). The warning about respecting others' values reflects the second house's opposition to the eighth house (others' resources/values), suggesting that over-assertion of personal values can create conflict in shared resource situations.

### 3. Sun in the Third House (太阳过境第三宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1719-1743):
> The Sun in this house turns your attention toward your immediate surroundings and increases your interaction with friends, neighbors, relatives and business associates — the people you deal with every day. It is a good time to look at how you handle these casual relationships that are so important for your life. Often we develop unfortunate little habits in communicating with these people, which undermine our effectiveness and our ability to communicate with them. In fact, clear communication should be one of the goals of this period. With the Sun in this house there is a temptation to pour out energy and take none in. But try to avoid this. Instead of always being the active agent in communication, be the passive one, too — in other words, listen!
> 
> This is also a time of year when the tempo of your life accelerates. There is more activity, more moving around and even a sense of restlessness that can be assuaged only by getting out and doing something new and different. You might take up the study of a subject that you have never encountered before, or you might take a series of short trips.
> 
> This is an especially good time to tell someone clearly how you feel about some subject. If others have been confused as to what you are doing or thinking in some area, you should be able now to communicate your real thoughts and intentions. Don't leave people in the dark about yourself. Your mental processes should be relatively clear now, and you can use this ability to get through to others.

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Third house**: literal = house of siblings/communication / symbolic = immediate environment, daily exchanges / context = Mercury's natural house
- **Immediate surroundings**: literal = nearby environment / symbolic = daily life sphere / context = regular contacts
- **Communication habits**: literal = patterns of exchange / symbolic = relational effectiveness / context = often unconscious patterns
- **Listen**: literal = receive information / symbolic = balance active/passive / context = counter Sun's outpouring tendency
- **Tempo accelerates**: literal = faster pace / symbolic = Mercury-like restlessness / context = increased mental activity
- **Short trips**: literal = nearby travel / symbolic = mental stimulation through movement / context = 3H traditional meaning

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The Sun's transit through your third house turns attention to your immediate environment—daily interactions with neighbors, relatives, friends, and business associates. This period illuminates how you handle these seemingly casual but vital relationships. Hand notes we often develop unconscious communication habits that undermine our effectiveness. Clear communication should be a primary goal. The Sun's nature creates temptation to pour out energy without receiving—Hand advises balancing this by listening, not just speaking. Life's tempo accelerates during this transit, bringing restlessness that demands new activities or short trips for satisfaction. Mental stimulation through study of unfamiliar subjects also fits this period. This is excellent timing for clear self-expression—communicate your real thoughts and intentions, especially where others have been confused about your position. Mental clarity is enhanced, supporting effective communication.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
太阳过境第三宫将注意力转向你的直接环境——与邻居、亲戚、朋友和商业伙伴的日常互动。这个时期照亮你如何处理这些看似随意但至关重要的关系。汉德指出我们常发展出削弱沟通效果的无意识交流习惯。清晰沟通应是主要目标。太阳的本质造成只输出能量不接收的倾向——汉德建议通过倾听来平衡，不只是说话。此行运期间生活节奏加快，带来不安分感，需要新活动或短途旅行来满足。学习不熟悉的科目进行心智刺激也适合这个时期。这是清晰自我表达的绝佳时机——传达你真实的想法和意图，尤其是在他人对你的立场感到困惑的领域。心智清晰度增强，支持有效沟通。

**Core Points**:
- Third house = immediate surroundings, daily contacts, communication
- Focus on casual but important relationships: neighbors, relatives, associates
- Examine communication habits that may undermine effectiveness
- Clear communication is primary goal of this period
- Sun temptation: pour out energy without receiving
- Counter-advice: listen, don't just speak
- Life tempo accelerates, restlessness increases
- New activities, study, or short trips satisfy restlessness
- Excellent time for clear self-expression
- Communicate real thoughts where confusion existed
- Mental clarity enhanced during transit

Hand's treatment of the third house transit emphasizes the dual nature of communication—both transmitting and receiving. The Sun's active, outpouring nature can unbalance communication toward one-way transmission. The advice to listen reflects understanding that third house effectiveness requires receptivity. The accelerated tempo and restlessness reflect Mercury's (natural 3H ruler) qualities being energized by the Sun. Short trips and new studies both satisfy the house's need for mental stimulation and variety.

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_pit_012]` `[trigger: sun_transit_house_3]` `[factor_trigger: astro_transit_sun AND astro_house_3]` `[role: 主干]` Sun in the third house turns attention toward immediate surroundings and increases interaction with daily contacts. → PIT Ch4 Sun-3H
- `[ns_pit_013]` `[trigger: sun_transit_house_3]` `[factor_trigger: astro_transit_sun AND astro_house_3]` `[role: 主干依赖]` We often develop unfortunate communication habits—clear communication should be one of the goals of this period. → PIT Ch4 Sun-3H
- `[ns_pit_014]` `[trigger: sun_transit_house_3]` `[factor_trigger: astro_transit_sun AND astro_house_3]` `[role: 条件分支]` With Sun here there is temptation to pour out energy and take none in—instead of always being active, listen! → PIT Ch4 Sun-3H
- `[ns_pit_015]` `[trigger: sun_transit_house_3]` `[factor_trigger: astro_transit_sun AND astro_house_3]` `[role: 主干依赖]` The tempo of life accelerates; restlessness can be assuaged only by getting out and doing something new. → PIT Ch4 Sun-3H
- `[ns_pit_016]` `[trigger: sun_transit_house_3]` `[factor_trigger: astro_transit_sun AND astro_house_3]` `[role: 总结]` Your mental processes should be relatively clear now—use this ability to communicate your real thoughts and get through to others. → PIT Ch4 Sun-3H

### 4. Sun in the Fourth House (太阳过境第四宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1744-1766):
> At this time of year you focus your concerns upon your most intimate personal life and the people who affect it most, your family and parents. You will want to be in familiar surroundings now and feel that you have some kind of center or place where you can build a solid base for your activities. For most people this means a home.
> 
> Although you should continue to live up to the demands of the outer world, because your personal life is interdependent with it, you should focus most of your attention inward. Not only inward to your personal life, but also inward in a psychological sense. Even more than the Sun's transit through the first house, this is a time of subjective consciousness, of feeling exactly where you are with respect to the world and getting in touch with your own deepest levels. If necessary, go off by yourself and spend time in contemplation or meditation.
> 
> Events that occurred in the past may come back to you now through memories and through consequences of those events that continue to affect you now. It is often wise to find out what effects your past, your upbringing and the experience of your family have had upon you. You may want to call in another person, perhaps even a professional counselor, to help you examine the role of the past in your present life. You may find that the past has generated behavior patterns that are completely inappropriate for your life now.

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Fourth house**: literal = IC house / symbolic = roots, home, family, inner foundation / context = psychological base
- **Intimate personal life**: literal = private sphere / symbolic = emotional foundation / context = family, home base
- **Subjective consciousness**: literal = inner awareness / symbolic = deepest self-connection / context = more than 1H transit
- **Contemplation/meditation**: literal = quiet reflection / symbolic = inner journey / context = accessing deep levels
- **Past effects**: literal = historical influences / symbolic = psychological conditioning / context = family patterns still active

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The Sun's fourth house transit focuses attention on your most intimate personal life—family, parents, and home. You seek familiar surroundings and a solid base for activities. While outer world demands continue, your primary focus should turn inward—not just to personal life but psychologically to your deepest levels. Hand emphasizes this as even more subjectively focused than the first house transit—a time to feel your exact position in the world and connect with innermost self. Contemplation or meditation may be needed. Past events resurface through memories and ongoing consequences. This is optimal timing to examine how your past, upbringing, and family experience have shaped current patterns. Professional counseling may help examine the past's role in present life. You may discover behavior patterns from the past that are now completely inappropriate.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
太阳过境第四宫将注意力聚焦于你最私密的个人生活——家庭、父母和家。你寻求熟悉的环境和稳固的活动基础。虽然外部世界的要求持续存在，但你的主要焦点应该转向内在——不仅是个人生活，而是心理上转向最深层次。汉德强调这比第一宫行运更具主观聚焦性——是感受你在世界中确切位置并连接最内在自我的时期。可能需要沉思或冥想。过去事件通过记忆和持续后果重新浮现。这是审视过去、成长经历和家庭经验如何塑造当前模式的最佳时机。专业咨询可能有助于检验过去在当前生活中的角色。你可能发现来自过去的行为模式现在已完全不适用。

**Core Points**:
- Fourth house = intimate personal life, family, parents, home
- Seek familiar surroundings and solid base for activities
- Focus inward: personal life AND astro_psychological deepest levels
- More subjectively focused than 1st house transit
- Time to feel exact position in world
- Connect with innermost self through contemplation/meditation
- Past events resurface through memories and consequences
- Examine how past, upbringing, family shaped current patterns
- Professional counseling may assist past examination
- May discover inappropriate behavior patterns from past

### 5. Sun in the Fifth House (太阳过境第五宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1767-1793):
> According to tradition, the Sun is happiest in the fifth house. With the Sun here, you feel most free to express yourself and to be yourself. Your primary drive is to do what you want and as much as possible to set your own priorities. You are not especially interested in dominating others, although you may be capable of it at this time, but you will vigorously oppose anyone who tries to prevent you from doing what you want to do.
> 
> The fifth house is often described as the house of amusement and recreation. Therefore you have a strong drive to get out and have a good time, and there is no reason why you shouldn't, as long as you make some effort to meet your daily obligations and restrictions. But the free-spirited drive of the fifth-house Sun may not want to do this, which can be a problem.
> 
> You may have great concern with children now, although this does not mean that you will have problems with them. It only means that your emotional involvement is great. If you have children, this is a good time to examine your relationship with them.
> 
> Your attitude toward your relationships is much lighter at this time, almost as if you saw your relationships as a stage upon which you can perform. At any rate, you favor more than usual the relationships that are fun. This same drive may lead you to a new love relationship with the opposite sex.
> 
> But don't get so wrapped up in yourself and your enjoyments that you forget to examine yourself. This is the time to be yourself, but it also is the time to become conscious of who you are.

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Fifth house**: literal = Leo's natural house / symbolic = creativity, joy, self-expression / context = Sun's home
- **Sun happiest**: literal = dignity by joy / symbolic = natural expression / context = Sun rules 5H naturally
- **Free to express yourself**: literal = uninhibited expression / symbolic = authentic self-manifestation / context = creative freedom
- **Amusement and recreation**: literal = fun activities / symbolic = pleasure principle / context = 5H traditional meaning
- **Children**: literal = offspring / symbolic = creative products / context = 5H rulership
- **Relationships as stage**: literal = theatrical view / symbolic = performance/display mode / context = Leo influence

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The Sun transiting the fifth house is traditionally considered the Sun's happiest placement. You feel most free to express yourself and be yourself authentically. Your primary drive is doing what you want and setting your own priorities. While capable of dominating others, that's not your interest—but you'll vigorously oppose anyone preventing your self-expression. The fifth house governs amusement and recreation, creating strong drive for enjoyment (balanced against daily obligations, though the free-spirited Sun here may resist this). Children become emotionally important during this transit—an excellent time to examine parent-child relationships. Your relationship attitude lightens, viewing relationships almost as a performance stage, favoring fun connections. This may lead to new romantic relationships. Hand's warning: don't become so wrapped up in enjoyment that you forget self-examination. This is time to BE yourself AND astro_become CONSCIOUS of who you are.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
太阳过境第五宫传统上被认为是太阳最快乐的位置。你感到最自由地表达自己和做真实的自己。你的主要驱动力是做你想做的事和设定自己的优先事项。虽然有能力支配他人，但那不是你的兴趣——但你会强烈反对任何阻止你自我表达的人。第五宫主管娱乐和休闲，创造强烈的享乐驱动（需与日常义务平衡，尽管这里自由奔放的太阳可能会抗拒）。孩子在此行运期间变得情感上重要——审视亲子关系的绝佳时机。你对关系的态度变得轻松，几乎把关系视为表演舞台，偏好有趣的连接。这可能导致新的浪漫关系。汉德的警告：不要过于沉浸在享乐中而忘记自我检视。这是做自己的时候，也是意识到自己是谁的时候。

**Core Points**:
- Fifth house = Sun's happiest placement traditionally
- Feel most free to express and be yourself
- Primary drive: do what you want, set own priorities
- Capable of domination but not interested in it
- Vigorously oppose those preventing self-expression
- Strong drive for amusement and recreation
- May conflict with daily obligations
- Children become emotionally important
- Good time to examine parent-child relationships
- Relationships viewed lighter, almost theatrical
- Favor fun relationships, possible new romance
- Warning: don't neglect self-examination in enjoyment
- Be yourself AND astro_become conscious of who you are

### 6. Sun in the Sixth House (太阳过境第六宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1794-1821):
> This transit is quite different from the immediately preceding one. Now is the time to examine the problem of how you should manage your life and what duties and responsibilities that entails. This is a house of work, of tasks that need to be done, which may necessitate postponing immediate gratification. Your focus should be on efficiency and effectiveness. Strive to make every action as much to the point as possible. In your work this is a good time to examine and refine your techniques and procedures, for your mind can work clearly and sharply to discover the best way of doing things.
> 
> The only problem you may have to contend with at this time is that you will probably not be on top of the heap. That is, you will probably have to work according to someone else's wishes or needs. But because of this, you can find out whether you can lower your ego drives when the situation requires it. If you cannot, you are likely to encounter quite a bit of discomfort and conflict at this time. This is the house of service, and you cannot spend all your efforts getting your own way now.
> 
> Nevertheless, this doesn't have to be a time of repression and self-denial, without satisfaction. You can derive quite a bit of satisfaction from doing things well, and that will mean more to you now than any other kind of satisfaction.
> 
> This transit also concerns physical efficiency. This is a house of health, but that does not mean that your physical health will necessarily be worse than usual. However, you will be more inclined to look at your body and to see how its functioning can be improved. You may be unusually concerned with health and hygiene.

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Sixth house**: literal = Virgo's house / symbolic = work, service, health, routine / context = duty focus
- **Duties and responsibilities**: literal = obligations / symbolic = service requirements / context = what must be done
- **Efficiency and effectiveness**: literal = optimal function / symbolic = Virgoan perfection drive / context = refinement
- **Not on top of heap**: literal = subordinate position / symbolic = ego subordination / context = service role
- **House of service**: literal = serving others / symbolic = ego transcendence through work / context = 6H core meaning
- **Physical efficiency/health**: literal = body function / symbolic = vessel maintenance / context = 6H health rulership

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
The Sun's sixth house transit contrasts sharply with the preceding fifth house joy. Now you examine life management—duties and responsibilities requiring postponed gratification. Focus on efficiency and effectiveness, making every action purposeful. This is excellent timing to examine and refine work techniques and procedures—your mind works clearly for discovering optimal methods. The challenge: you probably won't be "on top of the heap"—you'll work according to others' wishes or needs. This tests whether you can lower ego drives when required. If you cannot, expect discomfort and conflict. This is the house of service—you cannot spend all efforts getting your own way. Yet this needn't be repressive self-denial; satisfaction comes from doing things well, which matters more now than other satisfactions. Physical efficiency is also highlighted—not necessarily health problems, but increased inclination to examine body functioning and improvement. Unusual concern with health and hygiene may arise.

太阳过境第六宫与前面第五宫的欢乐形成鲜明对比。现在你审视生活管理——需要推迟即时满足的责任和义务。专注于效率和有效性，使每个行动都有目的。这是审视和完善工作技巧和程序的绝佳时机——你的头脑清晰地发现最佳方法。挑战是：你可能不会处于"顶端"——你将按照他人的意愿或需求工作。这考验你是否能在需要时降低自我驱动。如果不能，预期会有不适和冲突。这是服务之宫——你不能把所有精力都用于随心所欲。然而这不必是压抑的自我否定；满足感来自把事情做好，这比其他满足现在更重要。身体效率也被突显——不一定是健康问题，而是增加检视身体功能和改善的倾向。可能出现对健康和卫生的异常关注。

**Core Points**:
- Sixth house transit contrasts sharply with fifth house joy
- Focus on life management, duties, responsibilities
- May require postponing immediate gratification
- Emphasize efficiency and effectiveness in all actions
- Good time to refine work techniques and procedures
- Mind works clearly for finding optimal methods
- Probably not "on top"—work according to others' needs
- Test of lowering ego drives when required
- Inability to do so creates discomfort and conflict
- House of service—cannot focus only on own way
- Satisfaction from doing things well, not other pleasures
- Physical efficiency and health focus increased
- Not necessarily health problems—body improvement focus
- Unusual concern with health and hygiene possible

### 7. Sun in the Seventh House (太阳过境第七宫)

<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 1822-1852):
> At this time of year you should learn more about yourself through intimate one-to-one encounters with others. You will form working units with other people for various purposes, and through these units you will understand more about the effects that you have upon others.
> 
> One of the most important such relationship is marriage. If you are married, use this time to examine your relationship with your spouse and to discover what needs this relationship does and does not fill in your life.
> 
> This is not a time of the year when you should try to go it alone in any type of activity. You should try to work with someone else, or at least seek out the opinion of another person in an advisory capacity.
> 
> Sometimes the one-to-one encounter may take the form of a conflict. Conflict can be creative, because it forces you to examine your own position more thoroughly. You and your opponent form a pair, just as you and a partner do.

**English Paraphrase**: Learn about yourself through one-to-one encounters. Form working units with others; examine your effects on them. Marriage is the primary such relationship—examine what needs it fills and how well you fill your spouse's needs. NOT a time to go it alone—collaborate, seek advisory opinions. Conflict can be creative—forces self-examination. Opponent and partner both form pairs with you.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 通过一对一接触了解自己。与他人形成工作单位；检验你对他们的影响。婚姻是最重要的此类关系——检验它满足的需求以及你满足配偶需求的程度。不是独自行动的时期——合作，寻求咨询。冲突可以是创造性的——迫使自我检视。对手和伙伴都与你形成配对。

Mars-Sun transit most disruptive when ego energies operate unconsciously—blindly self-assertive, arouses opposition. Even under best circumstances, you will confront others—teammates or opponents.
