<!-- L1_BEGIN -->
**Source Text** (Lines 16650-16680):
> For several years you will be changing ways of interacting with others. Self-knowledge difficult but essential. Chameleon phase—unintentionally present wide variety of faces. Learn who you are in your own terms. Changes may confuse you and others. Relationships difficult because people attract only to currently projected image. Just as you may confuse and delude others, they may do the same to you. Wary of weird schemes—sense of reality not at best. May operate idealistically—acting on what you want to be true. May stimulate compassion—take care of someone or work to help others. Tendency to want to save others—avoid improper dependency. May seek someone who seems stronger—danger of becoming permanently dependent.

**English Paraphrase**: Self-knowledge essential but difficult. Chameleon phase—many faces. Relationships confused by projections. Be wary of weird schemes—reality sense poor. May act idealistically. Compassion stimulated but avoid creating dependency.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation**: 自我认知必要但困难。变色龙阶段——多面。关系被投射混淆。警惕奇怪计划——现实感差。可能理想主义行事。同情心被激发但避免制造依赖。

> Fundamental change of attitude toward possessions, coinciding with change in values. More attached to possessions, more likely to lose what you consider important. Neptune works against ego by muddying and confusing ideas prior to complete reorientation. Probably considerable confusion about property, may be deluded into costly mistakes. Worst trouble only if totally identify with material possessions. Neptune rules mystical principle of detachment. May be tempted to gamble or risky speculation—if playful spirit might do well, if serious and worried will probably lose.

Powerful inner effect: alter ways of dealing with world, thinking profoundly transformed. May begin serious study of metaphysical discipline—karma, reincarnation.

> Domestic and personal life will undergo strange and subtle changes, reflecting psychological changes within. May become attracted to spiritual and occult subjects from your own experiences. If haven't had much home life, may create in your mind ideal of what home should be—work hard to make it reality, but if too ideal, difficult for anything real to live up to. Another side: home life may become source of confusion because someone working against your best interests. May feel demoralized and less confident without any actual problems.

> Inclined to seek relationships fitting very romantic image, highest expectations. Sexual satisfaction may not be highest priority—concerned with spiritual union rather than purely physical. Possible to find spiritual relationship if don't confuse what you see with your ideal. Difficult pattern: idealize lover as someone who can save you from yourself—Neptunian illusion, don't take seriously. Or pattern reversed: become involved with someone who regards you as savior—exercise in futility (e.g., alcoholic lover). Try to relate as equals. Avoid risky financial ventures—fifth is house of gambling—may enjoy illusion you cannot lose, but you can and probably will. Children may be source of difficulty—illnesses or hard to understand. Avoid idealizing children—they operate from same crazy motives as adults. Transit stimulates artistic creativity—imagination improved, new ideas.

**English Paraphrase**: Seek romantic, spiritual relationships—but don't idealize. May seek savior or be seen as one—both problematic. Relate as equals. Avoid gambling—may feel can't lose but will. Children may be difficult. Artistic creativity stimulated.

> Affects health and work very strongly. Be careful of health—more subject to illnesses and infections. Usually no problems unless difficult transits simultaneously. Be careful of diseases from poisons and toxins, drugs or alcohol. May get strange ideas about nutrition and hygiene—total abstention diets. These not bad in themselves, but observe effects carefully, don't follow blindly. In area of work: best handled by working in social service field—with sick in hospitals/asylums or with poor. Not good time for advancing career for egotistical reasons—harder you work for own benefit, less you get. Can make great achievements only if working in spirit of service to others. May encounter serious misunderstanding with employers/employees. Path to advancement may be blocked mysteriously. May become involved in dishonest or subversive work without being aware. Effects minimized if regard work as service without worrying about what you'll get.

> Affects all one-to-one relationships—marriage, partnerships, conflicts, consultants. Danger of poor communications, misunderstandings, misrepresentation. In marriage: resentments not brought into open, one or both keeps feelings hidden, acts surreptitiously. Danger of overidealizing relations—thinking what you want to be true is true already. Be attentive to what's really happening. May have to take care of someone close who is sick. If in business, very careful about forming new partnership—not likely to work out, partner may be problem. Extreme cases: swindled by partner. Established partnership that worked well will continue, but communicate clearly. Normally not good for dealings with lawyers and lawsuits—won't get a good deal, factors determining outcome difficult to discover. Same for other consultants.

Want to learn more about yourself and make changes to work with unconscious drives more successfully. Good time to begin psychotherapy. Old order passing away, new one coming—process very subtle, may not notice until years passed. Someone close may die, changing your life considerably. May affect joint finances adversely—resources held with others. May cause misunderstanding with others concerning money/property. Danger of misrepresentation and fraud. Hidden forces at work preventing you from knowing what's happening. Not good time to borrow money—may have trouble getting bank loan anyway. Certainly don't borrow more than a little from friends—strict business relationship of bank mitigates fogginess, but casual borrowing from friends open to worst Neptunian misunderstandings.

> Stimulates interest in higher consciousness and spiritual truth. But if not careful, may totally misguide and confuse your outlook. You live as an ego with your own point of view (9H). Neptune represents state beyond ego where all is one. Neptune blurs distinctions between yourself and others and in the world. Effect is to expose you to ideas that blur usual viewpoint—may become less confident dealing with your universe, confused and disoriented. Problems arise because desperately trying to replace invalidated ideas with new ones that also appear invalid. Way to handle: wait and allow yourself not to know—give permission to be ignorant. In time, new mystical ways will crystallize. You'll understand that everything really is one. Pitfall: once you accept spiritual lesson, may use it to be superior to others—back into ego game, wandering into intellectual world, removed from others' feelings, less compassionate. Not good time for ego games. Time to learn and be grateful.

**English Paraphrase**: Interest in spiritual truth but may confuse outlook. Neptune blurs distinctions. May become less confident, disoriented. Allow yourself not to know. New mystical understanding will crystallize. Pitfall: using spirituality for ego. Time to learn, not ego games.

> Can be very confusing and disorienting, but can teach basic truths if you get over fear and confusion. Makes you feel unsure of where you're going and why. If regard work as justification for existence, very difficult time—Neptune makes you wonder if any purpose in what you're doing. Disillusionment may come through defeats or incident showing work not what you thought, or deception. Be careful about deceiving others or being deceived. May feel discouraged—people oppose efforts to get ahead for no apparent reason. May decide present calling not adequate, need more meaning. Need to change whole attitude toward what you're doing—should be appropriate self-expression, not justification. Be less attached to what you're doing—you are not what you do. Ego wrapped up in work probably causing problems with others. Favors social-service work with disadvantaged. Transit not destructive if work in spirit of helping others. May bring interest in psychic, spiritual, occult matters in profession.

> Ideals become more important, work hard to actualize them. Attracted in friendship to those who share your feelings. Be sure dealing with reality even as you attempt to actualize dreams. Be careful particularly with people you choose as friends—may be relating to what you'd like them to be rather than them as real people. Lays you open to disillusionment and deception. Don't become martyr to friends by letting them take undue advantage. Make sure people you help are worth helping—both you and they should get something. New friends may enter who share your ideals—can give each other moral support. Make sure you aren't fostering illusions that keep each from achieving real growth.

> Time of reflection and deep inner concerns. No longer adequate to be successful on external/material plane—must question and evaluate life's spiritual meaning. Have you been inwardly fulfilled or has life been shallow masquerade? Must deal with this dimension. May want to withdraw from rapid pace to find peace to examine yourself. If working hard on career, may want to slack off—more concerned with meaning in life. May stimulate concern with religion and faith.
