> [163] Only in the daughter is the mother-complex clear and uncomplicated. Here we have either an overdevelopment of feminine instincts indirectly caused by the mother, or a weakening of them to the point of complete extinction. In the first case, instinct makes the daughter unconscious of her own personality; in the latter, instincts are projected upon the mother.
>
> [166] All these possibilities are reflected in the mythological motifs enumerated earlier as different aspects of the mother archetype. Since I have dealt with the mother-complex of the son elsewhere, and my present theme is the archetype of the mother, in the following discussion I shall relegate masculine psychology to the background.

> [162] The effects of the mother-complex differ according to whether it appears in a son or a daughter. Typical effects on the son are homosexuality and Don Juanism, and sometimes also impotence. In homosexuality, the son's entire heterosexuality is tied to the mother in an unconscious form; in Don Juanism, he unconsciously seeks his mother in every woman he meets... Because of the difference in sex, a son's mother-complex does not appear in pure form. This is the reason why in every masculine mother-complex, side by side with the mother archetype, a significant role is played by the image of the man's sexual counterpart, the anima...
>
> [164] Since a "mother-complex" is a concept borrowed from psychopathology, it is always associated with the idea of injury and illness. But if we take the concept out of its narrow psychopathological setting and give it a wider connotation, we can see that it has positive effects as well. Thus a man with a mother-complex may have a finely differentiated Eros... This gives him a great capacity for friendship... He may have good taste and an aesthetic sense... He is likely to have a feeling for history... Often he is endowed with a wealth of religious feelings...
>
> [165] In the same way, what in its negative aspect is Don Juanism can appear positively as bold and resolute manliness; ambitious striving after the highest goals; opposition to all stupidity, narrow-mindedness, injustice, and laziness; willingness to make sacrifices for what is regarded as right, sometimes bordering on heroism; perseverance, inflexibility and toughness of will; a curiosity that does not shrink even from the riddles of the universe; and finally, a revolutionary spirit which strives to put a new face upon the world.
