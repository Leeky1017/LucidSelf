> [12] I can best illustrate my meaning by taking as an example the Swiss mystic and hermit, Brother Nicholas of Flüe, who has recently been canonized. Probably his most important religious experience was the so-called Trinity Vision, which preoccupied him to such an extent that he painted it, or had it painted, on the wall of his cell... It is a mandala divided into six parts, and in the centre is the crowned countenance of God.
>
> [13] The original experience, however, was entirely different. In his ecstasy there was revealed to Brother Klaus a sight so terrible that his own countenance was changed by it—so much so, indeed, that people were terrified and felt afraid of him... he had seen a piercing light resembling a human face. At the sight of it he feared that his heart would burst into little pieces.
>
> [17] This vision, undoubtedly fearful and highly perturbing, which burst like a volcano upon his religious view of the world, without any dogmatic prelude and without exegetical commentary, naturally needed a long labour of assimilation... Brother Klaus came to terms with his experience on the basis of dogma, then firm as a rock; and the dogma proved its powers of assimilation by turning something horribly alive into the beautiful abstraction of the Trinity idea.
>
> [21] Dogma takes the place of the collective unconscious by formulating its contents on a grand scale. The Catholic way of life is completely unaware of psychological problems in this sense. Almost the entire life of the collective unconscious has been channelled into the dogmatic archetypal ideas and flows along like a well-controlled stream in the symbolism of creed and ritual.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Trinity Vision | Vision of three-in-one God | Numinous archetypal experience | Brother Klaus's terrifying encounter |
| Mandala | Circular sacred diagram | Symbol of wholeness/protection | Antidote for chaotic states |
| Dogma | Official religious doctrine | Archetypal container | Transforms raw experience into form |
| Elaboration | Working-through process | Psychological assimilation | Symbol formation |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Brother Klaus's terrifying vision**:
Brother Nicholas of Flüe (1417-1487), Swiss mystic and hermit, had a Trinity Vision so intense he painted it as a mandala. But the **original experience was entirely different** from the dogmatic version. He saw a sight so **terrible** that his countenance was permanently changed—people were terrified of him. He saw a "piercing light resembling a human face" and feared his heart would **burst into little pieces**.

**The mandala as protection**:
Brother Klaus investigated his vision using a German mystic's illustrated booklet—this "elaboration of the symbol" took years. The vision has been compared to Revelation 1:13—the strange apocalyptic Christ-image. The mandala (protective circle) is the **traditional antidote for chaotic states of mind**. Brother Klaus was fascinated by the wheel symbol because such visions cause mental confusion and disintegration.

**Dogma's assimilative power**:
The vision "burst like a volcano" upon his religious worldview without dogmatic prelude. He needed **long labour of assimilation** to fit it into his psyche's total structure. Dogma proved its power by **turning something horribly alive into the beautiful abstraction** of the Trinity idea. Without dogma, he might have become a heretic or lunatic rather than a saint.

**Dogma as container of collective unconscious**:
Dogma **takes the place of the collective unconscious** by formulating its contents on a grand scale. The Catholic way of life channels almost the entire life of the collective unconscious into dogmatic archetypal ideas—flowing like a **well-controlled stream** in creed and ritual symbolism. Before the Church, there were antique mysteries reaching back to neolithic prehistory.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**克劳斯兄弟的可怕幻象**：
弗吕厄的尼古拉斯兄弟（1417-1487），瑞士神秘主义者和隐士，有过一个三位一体幻象，强烈到他将其画成曼陀罗。但**原始经验完全不同于**教义版本。他看到的景象如此**可怕**，以至于他的面容永久改变——人们见到他都感到恐惧。他看到"刺目的光芒像人脸"，害怕自己的心会**碎成小片**。

**曼陀罗作为保护**：
克劳斯兄弟借助一本德国神秘主义者的插图手册研究他的幻象——这种"象征的精心加工"花了数年。该幻象与《启示录》1:13的异象相比——那奇异的末世基督意象。曼陀罗（保护圈）是**混乱心灵状态的传统解药**。克劳斯兄弟被轮子象征吸引，因为这种幻象会导致精神混乱和解体。

**教义的同化力量**：
幻象"像火山一样爆发"进入他的宗教世界观，没有教义前奏。他需要**漫长的同化劳动**才能将其纳入心灵的整体结构。教义通过**将可怕的活物转化为三位一体理念的美丽抽象**证明了其力量。没有教义，他可能成为异端或疯子而非圣人。

**教义作为集体无意识的容器**：
教义通过大规模地表述集体无意识的内容来**代替集体无意识**。天主教生活方式将集体无意识的几乎全部生命都引导到教义原型观念中——像**受控良好的溪流**一样流淌在信条和仪式象征主义中。在教会之前，有古代密仪延伸回新石器时代史前。

**Core Points**:
- Brother Klaus's original vision was terrifying, not beatific
- His face was permanently changed—people feared him
- "Piercing light like human face" = archetypal numinosum
- Fear that heart would "burst into little pieces" = ego dissolution threat
- Mandala is traditional antidote for chaotic states
- Symbol elaboration took years of psychological work
- Dogma transforms raw archetypal experience into containable form
- Without dogma: heretic or lunatic instead of saint
- Dogma replaces collective unconscious by formulating its contents
- Catholic life channels CU into well-controlled symbolic stream
- Antique mysteries preceded Christianity, reaching to prehistory

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: Jung's sources include Woelflin (oldest source, 15th century), Blanke (modern scholarly), and Bovillus (1508 humanist letter). The comparison with Revelation 1:13 is Jung's own amplification—controversial among theologians but psychologically illuminating.
- **中文**: 荣格的资料来源包括沃尔夫林（最古老来源，15世纪）、布兰克（现代学术）和博维勒斯（1508年人文主义者书信）。与《启示录》1:13的比较是荣格自己的放大——在神学家中有争议，但在心理学上有启发性。"""
