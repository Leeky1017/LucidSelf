A man may be convinced in good faith that he has no religious ideas, but no one can fall so far away from humanity that he no longer has any dominating représentation collective. His very materialism, atheism, communism, socialism, liberalism, intellectualism, existentialism, or what not, testifies against his innocence.

> [127] The only thing we know positively from psychological experience is that theistic ideas are associated with the parental imagos, and that our patients are mostly unconscious of them. If the corresponding projections cannot be withdrawn through insight, then we have every reason to suspect the presence of emotional contents of a religious nature.

> [128] So far as we have any information about man, we know that he has always and everywhere been under the influence of dominating ideas. Anyone who alleges that he is not can immediately be suspected of having exchanged a known form of belief for a variant which is less known both to himself and to others.

> [130] The représentations collectives have a dominating power, so it is not surprising that they are repressed with the most intense resistance. Behind the parental pair, or pair of lovers, lie contents of extreme tension which are not apperceived in consciousness and can therefore become perceptible only through projection.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Représentation collective | Collective representation | Dominating ideas | Durkheimian term |
| Religious ideas | Theistic concepts | Charged with emotional power | Associated with parents |
| Atheism as religion | Belief in no-god | Still a dominating idea | Substituted religion |
| Archetype's specific energy | Instinctual charge | Cannot be ignored | Remains active |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Religion more embarrassing than sex**:
In society, it is more embarrassing to talk about **God** than to tell a risqué story. Many find it more bearable to admit sexual fantasies than to confess their analyst is a "saviour"—for the former is biologically legitimate, the latter seems pathological.

**Représentations collectives**:
Religious ideas are charged with **extremely suggestive, emotional power**. This includes all représentations collectives—anything with an "-ism" attached. A man may believe he has no religious ideas, but no one falls so far from humanity as to have no **dominating représentation collective**. Materialism, atheism, communism, socialism, existentialism—all testify against his innocence. Somewhere he is **possessed by a supraordinate idea**.

**Universal domination by ideas**:
Man has always and everywhere been under the influence of **dominating ideas**. Anyone who claims otherwise has merely exchanged a known belief for a less-known variant. Instead of theism: atheism. Instead of Dionysus: Mithras. Instead of heaven: paradise on earth.

**Archetype's specific energy**:
A man without a dominating représentation collective would be **thoroughly abnormal**. The archetype behind religious ideas has, like every instinct, its **specific energy**—which it does not lose even if conscious mind ignores it. Anyone who puts off the mantle of faith does so only because another lies close to hand. **No one can escape the prejudice of being human**.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**宗教比性更尴尬**：
在社会上，谈论**上帝**比讲荤段子更尴尬。许多人宁愿承认性幻想也不愿承认分析师是"救世主"——因为前者在生物学上合理，后者似乎病态。

**集体表象**：
宗教观念带有**极具暗示性的情感力量**。这包括所有集体表象——任何带"-主义"的东西。一个人可能相信自己没有宗教观念，但没有人会远离人性到没有**主导集体表象**。唯物主义、无神论、共产主义、社会主义、存在主义——都证明其不无辜。某处他被**超越性观念所占据**。

**观念的普遍统治**：
人类总是处于**主导观念**的影响下。声称不是的人只是用不太为人知的变体替换了已知信仰。无神论代替有神论。密特拉代替狄奥尼索斯。人间天堂代替天堂。

**原型的特定能量**：
一个没有主导集体表象的人将是**彻底异常的**。宗教观念背后的原型像每种本能一样有其**特定能量**——即使意识忽视它也不会失去。脱下信仰外衣者只因另一件在手边。**没有人能逃脱作为人的偏见**。

**Core Points**:
- More embarrassing to discuss God than sex in society
- All "-isms" are religious substitutes (représentations collectives)
- No one escapes dominating ideas—materialism/atheism included
- Man always under influence of supraordinate ideas
- Archetype behind religion has specific energy that persists
- Putting off one faith means another lies at hand
- "No one can escape the prejudice of being human"
- Behind parental pair lie contents of extreme tension (projection)

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: Jung's use of Durkheim's "représentations collectives" places archetypes in a sociological context while transcending it. The claim that atheism/materialism are equally "religious" is provocative and central to Jung's critique of modern rationalism.
- **中文**: 荣格使用涂尔干的"集体表象"将原型置于社会学语境中同时超越它。无神论/唯物主义同样是"宗教性的"这一主张具有挑衅性，是荣格批判现代理性主义的核心。"""
