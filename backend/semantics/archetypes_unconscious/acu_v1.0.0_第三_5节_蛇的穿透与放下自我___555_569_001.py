    original_text: str = """**原文** (¶555-569, 行8700-8850):

> [556-557] The black serpent has golden wings of Mercury—consequently possesses pneumatic nature. The alchemists represented their Mercurius duplex as the winged and wingless dragon, calling the former feminine and the latter masculine. The serpent represents not so much the spermatozoon but the phallus. Leone Ebreo calls Mercury the membrum virile of heaven (macrocosm as homo maximus).
>
> [558-559] The lightning has the same illuminating, vivifying, fertilizing, transforming, and healing function as the snake. Miss X felt the snake at first as a "terrible danger" threatening the "integrity of the sphere." She was in a dilemma—could not accept the snake because its sexual significance was clear. I showed her a similar picture by a man. She said: "I suddenly understood the process in a more impersonal way—the ego was not the centre, but, following a universal law, I circled round a sun."
>
> [562-563] Miss X felt Picture 4 was the most difficult, denoting the turning point. The clearly felt, ruthless setting aside of the so beloved ego is no light matter. "Letting go" is the sine qua non of all forms of higher spiritual development. But relinquishing the ego is not an act of will—it is an event whose inner, compelling logic can be disguised only by wilful self-deception. Since everything passes, the moment may come when the relinquished ego must be reinstated. Letting go gives the unconscious the opportunity; but holding fast requires conscious will, the ego.
>
> [564-565] The sphere has been fecundated: it has gotten bigger and blossoms in vivid colours. The nucleus has divided into four—a differentiation of consciousness. The division into four has always existed, from the four sons of Horus to the tetrameria of the opus alchymicum.

**英文释义**：
- 黑蛇有墨丘利的金翅膀 = 气息性质
- 炼金术：Mercurius duplex = 有翅龙（女性）+ 无翅龙（男性）
- 蛇 = 阳具；Leone Ebreo：墨丘利 = 天的阳具
- 闪电 = 蛇的功能：启明、活化、受精、转化、治愈
- X小姐起初感到蛇是"可怕危险"威胁"球体完整"
- 理解转变："自我不是中心——遵循普遍规律，我绕着太阳旋转"
- 放下自我 = 所有高等灵性发展的必要条件
- 放下自我不是意志行为——是事件
- 需要时刻：放下给无意识机会；抓紧需要自我
- 球体受精后变大、绽放；核分裂为四
- 四分法：从荷鲁斯四子到炼金术四分体

**中文诠释**：
- 黑蛇有金翅膀 = 墨丘利的气息本质
- Mercurius duplex：有翅龙（女）vs 无翅龙（男）
- 蛇象征阳具；墨丘利 = 天（宏观宇宙）的阳具
- 闪电功能 = 蛇功能：启明、活化、受精、转化、治愈
- X小姐最初视蛇为威胁球体完整的危险
- 领悟："自我不是中心——遵循普遍规律绕太阳旋转"
- 放下自我 = 高等灵性发展的必要条件
- 这不是意志——是事件
- 放下给无意识机会；但抓紧需要自我意识
- 受精后球体变大、绽放；核分四
- 四分法从古至今：荷鲁斯四子→四元素→炼金术四阶段
