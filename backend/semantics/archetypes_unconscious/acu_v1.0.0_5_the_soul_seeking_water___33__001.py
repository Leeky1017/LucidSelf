**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Soul's way to water**:
The way of the soul seeking its lost father—like Sophia seeking Bythos—leads to the **water**, to the **dark mirror** at its bottom. Whoever elects spiritual poverty goes the way leading to water. This water is no figure of speech but a **living symbol of the dark psyche**.

**The theologian's dream**:
A Protestant theologian dreamed repeatedly of standing on a mountain slope with a deep valley below containing a **dark lake**. Something always prevented him from approaching. This time he resolved to go. As he approached, everything grew dark and uncanny. A **gust of wind** rushed over the water's face—he was seized by panic fear and awoke.

**The miracle of Bethesda**:
This dream shows natural symbolism. The dreamer descends into his own depths to the mysterious water. Then occurs the miracle of **Bethesda**: an angel touches the water, endowing it with healing power. In the dream, the wind = the **pneuma** which "bloweth where it listeth." Man's descent to water evokes the miracle of its coming to life. But the spirit rushing over dark water is uncanny—it hints at an **unseen presence**, a numen.

**The Gnostic pearl hymn**:
We must go the way of waters—always tending **downward**—to raise up the treasure, the father's precious heritage. In the **Gnostic hymn to the soul**, the son is sent to seek the pearl that fell from the King's crown. It lies at a deep well's bottom, guarded by a dragon, in Egypt—land of fleshpots. The son forgets himself in Egyptian orgies until a letter from his father reminds him. He plunges into the well's dark depths and finds the pearl.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**灵魂通往水的道路**：
灵魂寻找失落父亲的道路——如索菲亚寻找毕索斯——通向**水**，通向其底部的**黑暗镜子**。选择精神贫困者走向通往水的灵魂之路。这水不是修辞，而是**黑暗心灵的活象征**。

**神学家的梦**：
一位新教神学家反复梦见自己站在山坡上，下方深谷中有一个**黑暗的湖**。某种东西总是阻止他接近。这次他决心前往。当他接近时，一切变得黑暗而诡异。一阵**风**突然掠过水面——他被恐慌攫住，惊醒。

**贝塞斯达的奇迹**：
这个梦展示了自然象征主义。做梦者下降到自己的深处，到达神秘的水。然后发生了**贝塞斯达**的奇迹：天使触碰水，赋予其治愈力量。在梦中，风 = **普纽玛**，"随意吹拂"。人下降到水唤起水复活的奇迹。但精神掠过黑暗水域是诡异的——它暗示**看不见的存在**，一个神明。

**诺斯底珍珠颂歌**：
我们必须走水的道路——总是**向下**——才能举起宝藏，父亲的珍贵遗产。在**诺斯底灵魂颂歌**中，儿子被派去寻找从国王王冠落下的珍珠。它躺在深井底部，被龙看守，在埃及——肉锅之地。儿子在埃及狂欢中忘记自己，直到父亲的信提醒他。他跳入井的黑暗深处，找到珍珠。

**Core Points**:
- Soul seeking lost father leads to water = dark mirror of psyche
- Spiritual poverty leads to water symbolism
- Water is living symbol of dark psyche, not mere metaphor
- Theologian's dream: prevented from approaching dark lake until resolved
- Gust of wind = pneuma = living spirit
- Bethesda miracle: angel touches water, brings healing power
- Spirit over water is uncanny—unseen numen
- Must go downward (water's way) to raise treasure
- Gnostic pearl hymn: son sent to retrieve pearl from well
- Pearl guarded by dragon in Egypt (worldliness)
- Son forgets, then remembers through father's letter

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: The Gnostic "Hymn of the Pearl" (¶37) is from the Acts of Thomas. Jung's reading emphasizes the psychological meaning: the pearl = Self; Egypt = worldly unconsciousness; dragon = guardian of threshold. The Sophia-Bythos motif is from Valentinian Gnosticism.
- **中文**: 诺斯底"珍珠颂歌"（¶37）出自《多马行传》。荣格的解读强调心理意义：珍珠 = 自性；埃及 = 世俗无意识；龙 = 门槛守护者。索菲亚-毕索斯母题来自瓦伦廷诺斯底主义。"""
