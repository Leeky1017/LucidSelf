> [8] Primitive man impresses us so strongly with his subjectivity that we should really have guessed long ago that myths refer to something psychic. His knowledge of nature is essentially the language and outer dress of an unconscious psychic process. But the very fact that this process is unconscious gives us the reason why man has thought of everything except the psyche in his attempts to explain myths. He simply didn't know that the psyche contains all the images that have ever given rise to myths, and that our unconscious is an acting and suffering subject with an inner drama which primitive man rediscovers, by means of analogy, in the processes of nature both great and small.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Psychic process | Mental activity | Inner drama | Myths as outer dress of psyche |
| Tribal lore | Indigenous knowledge | Sacred tradition | Sacred and dangerous |
| Religious formula | Dogmatic expression | Archetypal container | Replaces direct experience |
| Treasure-house | Repository of riches | Collective unconscious | Eternal images within |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Myth as psychic projection**:
Primitive man's knowledge of nature is essentially the **language and outer dress** of an unconscious psychic process. Myths refer to something psychic. The psyche contains all images that give rise to myths. Our unconscious is an **acting and suffering subject** with an inner drama that primitive man rediscovers by analogy in nature's processes.

**Fate within the breast**:
"The stars of thine own fate lie in thy breast" (Schiller's Wallenstein)—this dictum should satisfy astrologers if we understood the heart's secrets. Astrological patterns are projections of inner psychological realities.

**Sacred and dangerous tribal lore**:
All esoteric teachings seek to apprehend the unseen happenings in the psyche and claim supreme authority. World religions contain **revealed knowledge** that was originally hidden—they set forth the soul's secrets in glorious images. But the more beautiful and comprehensive the traditional image, the **further removed from individual experience**.

**Why psychology is youngest science**:
We have not discovered the unconscious because we had **religious formulas** for everything psychic—more beautiful and comprehensive than immediate experience. The Christian symbol, the Eastern symbols—these eternal images attract, convince, fascinate, overpower. They safeguard man from immediate experience of the divine while giving a premonition of it.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**神话作为心理投射**：
原始人的自然知识本质上是无意识心理过程的**语言和外衣**。神话指向心理层面。心灵包含一切产生神话的意象。我们的无意识是一个**行动和受苦的主体**，有着内在戏剧，原始人通过类比在自然过程中重新发现它。

**命运在胸中**：
"你命运的星辰在你胸中"（席勒《华伦斯坦》）——如果我们了解心的秘密，这格言应能满足所有占星师。占星模式是内在心理现实的投射。

**神圣而危险的部落知识**：
所有秘传教导都试图理解心灵中看不见的事件，并宣称至高权威。世界宗教包含原本隐藏的**启示知识**——以辉煌意象展示灵魂的秘密。但传统意象越美丽、越崇高、越全面，就**距离个人经验越远**。

**为何心理学是最年轻的科学**：
我们没有发现无意识，因为我们有**宗教公式**来解释一切心理现象——比直接经验更美丽、更全面。基督教象征、东方象征——这些永恒意象吸引、说服、迷惑、征服。它们在给人神圣预感的同时，保护人免受神性的直接经验。

**Core Points**:
- Myths are outer dress of unconscious psychic processes
- Nature knowledge = language of inner drama
- Unconscious = acting and suffering subject
- "Stars of fate lie in thy breast" = inner astrology
- Tribal lore is sacred and dangerous
- Religious images = revealed knowledge of soul's secrets
- More beautiful the tradition, further from individual experience
- Religious formulas replaced need for psychological discovery
- Eternal images safeguard from immediate divine experience
- Psychology youngest science because religion provided formulas

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: The Schiller quotation in ¶9 ("The stars of thine own fate lie in thy breast") is from Wallenstein's Death (III.1). Jung uses it to illustrate that astrological influences are actually psychological projections—a key point for understanding his view of astrology as symbolic language.
- **中文**: ¶9中的席勒引文（"你命运的星辰在你胸中"）出自《华伦斯坦之死》（III.1）。荣格用它说明占星影响实际上是心理投射——这是理解他将占星术视为象征语言的关键。"""
