> [69] Ultimately all important ideas are founded on primordial archetypal forms whose concreteness dates from a time when consciousness did not think, but only perceived. "Thoughts" were objects of inner perception, not thought at all, but sensed as external phenomena—seen or heard, so to speak. Thought was essentially revelation, not invented but forced upon us.

> [70-71] A young theological student dreamed: He was standing in the presence of a handsome old man dressed entirely in black. He knew it was the white magician. This personage had just addressed him, but the dreamer could only remember the closing words: "And for this we need the help of the black magician." At that moment the door opened and in came another old man exactly like the first, except that he was dressed in white. He said, "I need your advice," and threw a questioning look at the dreamer, whereupon the white magician answered: "You can speak freely, he is an innocent."

> [72-73] The old king is the ruling symbol that wants to go to its eternal rest... His choice falls on the grave of anima, who lies in the death trance of a Sleeping Beauty so long as the king is alive. But when the king draws to his end, she comes to life again and changes into a black horse, which in Plato's parable stands for the unruliness of the passions... But there lie the keys of paradise... the mandala is a symbol of individuation.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| White/Black Magician | Opposing figures | Dual spirit | Both needed for wholeness |
| Old King | Ruling principle | Outworn dominant | Death of old symbol |
| Black horse | Wild animal | Passion/instinct | From virgin's bones |
| Keys of paradise | Access to wholeness | Individuation path | Found in desert |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Primordial thought**:
All important ideas are founded on **primordial archetypal forms** from a time when consciousness did not think but only perceived. Thoughts were **revelation**—not invented but forced upon us. We have a pre-existent thinking of which we're unaware so long as the father or king is not dead.

**The theological student's dream**:
A young theological student dreamed he stood before an old man in black whom he knew was the **white magician**. The magician said: "For this we need the help of the **black magician**." Then entered another old man dressed in white—the black magician—saying "I need your advice." The black magician told a story: An old king sought a tomb and chose one where a virgin was buried. When opened, her bones became a **black horse** that fled into the desert. The black magician followed and found **the lost keys of paradise**.

**Dream interpretation**:
- **Old king** = ruling symbol wanting eternal rest
- **Virgin's grave** = anima in death-trance (Sleeping Beauty)
- When king dies, anima awakens as **black horse** (Platonic unruly passions)
- **Desert** = spiritual isolation
- **Keys of paradise** = mandala = individuation
- The **black** magician finds what leads to wholeness

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**原初思维**：
所有重要观念都建立在**原初原型形式**之上，来自意识只是感知而不思考的时代。思维是**启示**——不是发明而是强加于我们。我们有一种先存思维，只要父亲或国王不死，我们就不知道它。

**神学生的梦**：
一位年轻神学生梦见自己站在一位穿黑衣的老人面前，他知道这是**白魔法师**。魔法师说："为此我们需要**黑魔法师**的帮助。"然后进来另一位穿白衣的老人——黑魔法师——说"我需要你的建议。"黑魔法师讲述一个故事：一位老国王寻找墓穴，选择了一个埋葬着处女的。当打开时，她的骨头变成一匹**黑马**逃入沙漠。黑魔法师追踪并找到了**失落的天堂钥匙**。

**梦的解释**：
- **老国王** = 想要永恒安息的主导象征
- **处女之墓** = 死亡恍惚中的阿尼玛（睡美人）
- 当国王死去，阿尼玛以**黑马**醒来（柏拉图的不驯激情）
- **沙漠** = 精神孤立
- **天堂钥匙** = 曼陀罗 = 个体化
- **黑**魔法师找到通往整体性的道路

**Core Points**:
- Important ideas founded on primordial archetypal forms
- Thoughts originally = revelation, not invention
- Pre-existent thinking exists until "king dies"
- White magician needs black magician's help
- Black magician dressed in white (inversion)
- Old king = outworn ruling symbol
- Anima in Sleeping Beauty trance until king dies
- Black horse = instinctual passion released
- Desert = spiritual isolation
- Keys of paradise = individuation (mandala)
- Dark side finds the solution

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_054]` `[trigger: primordial_thought]` `[factor_trigger: jung_archetype AND jung_revelation]` `[role: 主干]` All important ideas are founded on primordial archetypal forms—thought was revelation, forced upon us, not invented. → ¶69
- `[ns_cw9i_055]` `[trigger: two_magicians]` `[factor_trigger: jung_wise_old_man]` `[role: 主干依赖]` The white magician said: "For this we need the help of the black magician"—dressed in opposite colors, they are two aspects of the same archetype. → ¶71
- `[ns_cw9i_056]` `[trigger: old_king_dies]` `[factor_trigger: jung_symbol AND jung_transformation]` `[role: 条件分支]` The old king is the ruling symbol that wants eternal rest—when he dies, the anima awakens as a black horse. → ¶72
- `[ns_cw9i_057]` `[trigger: keys_paradise]` `[factor_trigger: jung_mandala AND jung_individuation]` `[role: 总结]` The black magician found the lost keys of paradise—the mandala is a symbol of individuation. → ¶73

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: The two magicians dream (¶70-73) is one of Jung's most important clinical examples. The color inversion (white magician in black, black magician in white) illustrates the relativity of moral opposites—a key theme in Jungian psychology.
- **中文**: 两个魔法师的梦（¶70-73）是荣格最重要的临床案例之一。颜色倒置（穿黑衣的白魔法师，穿白衣的黑魔法师）说明道德对立的相对性——荣格心理学的核心主题。"""
