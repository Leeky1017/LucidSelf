A view of the world or a social order that cuts him off from the primordial images of life not only is no culture at all but, in increasing degree, is a prison or a stable.

> [175] This excursion into the realm of generalities was unavoidable, because the mother is the first world of the child and the last world of the adult. We are all wrapped as her children in the mantle of this great Isis. In a man, the mother-complex is never "pure"—it is always mixed with the anima archetype.

> [176] The overdeveloped Eros type has positive aspects society could ill afford to do without. This type often develops in reaction to a mother who is wholly a thrall of nature, purely instinctive and all-devouring. The reactive intensification of the daughter's Eros is aimed at rescuing some man from the preponderance of the female-maternal element in his life.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Mother-love | Maternal affection | Mysterious root of growth | Universal experience |
| Mater natura/spiritualis | Mother nature/spirit | Totality of life | Beyond personal mother |
| Psychic hygiene | Mental health | Practical necessity | Why archetypes matter |
| Primordial images | Original patterns | Roots of being | Must stay conscious |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**The glorified mother**:
Mother-love is one of the most moving and unforgettable memories of our lives—the **mysterious root of all growth and change**; homecoming, shelter, the long silence from which everything begins and ends. Intimately known yet strange like Nature; lovingly tender yet cruel like fate; joyous giver of life—**mater dolorosa** and mute implacable portal that closes upon the dead. "Mother is mother-love, my experience and my secret."

**Do not load mother with archetype**:
We should not load that enormous burden of meaning—heaven and hell—onto one **frail and fallible human being** who was our mother. She carries for us the inborn image of **mater natura and mater spiritualis**, the totality of life. We must relieve the human mother of this appalling burden. This massive weight ties us to her and chains her to us—to the detriment of both.

**Archetypes as psychic hygiene**:
The archetype is less a scientific problem than an **urgent question of psychic hygiene**. Even if all proofs were lacking, we would have to **invent archetypes** to keep our highest values from disappearing into the unconscious. When they fall into unconscious, the whole elemental force is lost—we become fixated on mother-imago, tied to mere reason, condemned to doctrinairism.

**Remain conscious of archetypes**:
Man must remain conscious of the world of archetypes because there he is **part of Nature** and connected with his roots. A social order that cuts him off from primordial images is not culture but a **prison or stable**. The rational must be counterbalanced by the irrational. "The world exists only because opposing forces are held in equilibrium."

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**被颂扬的母亲**：
母爱是我们生命中最动人和难忘的记忆之一——**所有成长和变化的神秘根源**；归家、庇护、一切开始和结束的长久沉默。既熟悉又陌生如自然；既温柔又残酷如命运；生命的欢乐赐予者——**悲伤圣母**和向死者关闭的无言铁门。"母亲是母爱，我的经验和我的秘密。"

**不要让母亲承担原型**：
我们不应该把那巨大的意义负担——天堂和地狱——放在一个**脆弱易错的人**身上，她是我们的母亲。她为我们承载着**自然母亲和精神母亲**的先天意象，生命的整体。我们必须减轻人类母亲的这种可怕负担。这巨大重量把我们绑在她身上，把她绑在我们身上——对双方都有害。

**原型作为心理卫生**：
原型与其说是科学问题，不如说是**紧迫的心理卫生问题**。即使所有证据都缺乏，我们也必须**发明原型**以防止最高价值消失在无意识中。当它们落入无意识，原始经验的全部元素力量就丧失了——我们固定在母亲意象上，被绑在纯粹理性上，被判教条主义。

**保持对原型的意识**：
人必须保持对原型世界的意识，因为在那里他是**自然的一部分**并与他的根源相连。一个将他与原始意象切断的社会秩序不是文化，而是**监狱或马厩**。理性必须由非理性来平衡。"世界之所以存在，只因对立力量保持平衡。"

**Core Points**:
- Mother-love = mysterious root of growth, homecoming, silence
- Mother carries mater natura and mater spiritualis image
- Do not burden personal mother with archetype's weight
- Archetype = question of psychic hygiene, not just science
- Without archetypes, highest values fall into unconscious
- Then: fixation on mother-imago, doctrinairism
- Must remain conscious of archetypes to stay connected to roots
- Social order without primordial images = prison
- Rational must be balanced by irrational
