> [131] One of the most instructive examples in this respect is the vision of the recently canonized Nicholas of Flüe, a Swiss mystic of the fifteenth century... In the visions that marked his initiation into the state of adoption by God, God appeared in dual form, once as a majestic father and once as a majestic mother. This representation could not be more unorthodox, since the Church had eliminated the feminine element from the Trinity a thousand years earlier as heretical...
>
> [132] There is a very similar case in the visions of Guillaume de Digulleville, which are described in Le Pèlerinage de l'âme. He saw God in the highest heaven as the King on a shining round throne, and beside him sat the Queen of Heaven on a throne of brown crystal. For a monk of the Cistercian Order—distinguished for its severity—this vision is exceedingly heretical.
>
> [133] Another impressive account of the syzygy vision can be found in Edward Maitland's biography of Anna Kingsford. He describes his own experience of God as a vision of light: "This was God as the Lord, proving by His duality that God is Substance as well as Force, Love as well as Will, feminine as well as masculine, Mother as well as Father."
>
> [134] We can hardly get round the hypothesis that an emotionally charged content is lying ready in the unconscious and springs into projection at a certain moment. This content is the syzygy motif, and it expresses the fact that a masculine element is always paired with a feminine one.
>
> [135] It is natural to suspect the parental pair in all syzygies. The feminine part corresponds to the anima. But parents are also the least known of all human beings—hence an unconscious reflection exists which is as utterly alien as a man compared with a god.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Nicholas of Flüe | Swiss mystic | Archetypal visionary | Case example |
| God as Father-Mother | Dual deity | Heretical syzygy | Spontaneous archetype |
| Emotionally charged | High affect | Archetypal power | Projection force |
| Fundamental psychic factor | Core pattern | Universal importance | Syzygy status |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

Jung presents **syzygy vision evidence**:

**Brother Klaus case**:
- Swiss mystic, 15th century, recently canonized
- Vision: God appeared as **majestic father AND jung_majestic mother**
- "Could not be more unorthodox"—Church eliminated feminine 1000 years earlier
- Simple peasant, no Gnostic knowledge—spontaneous archetypal vision

**Proof of archetype**:
- Emotionally charged content lies ready in unconscious
- Springs into projection at certain moment
- **Syzygy motif**: masculine always paired with feminine
- Wide distribution + extraordinary emotionality = fundamental psychic factor
- As important as microbes (were before discovery)

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

荣格呈现**配对幻象证据**：

**克劳斯兄弟案例**：
- 瑞士神秘主义者，15世纪，最近封圣
- 幻象：上帝显现为**威严父亲和威严母亲**
- "不能更不正统"——教会1000年前已消除女性元素
- 简单农民，无诺斯替知识——自发原型幻象

**原型证明**：
- 情感充电的内容在无意识中准备就绪
- 在特定时刻跳入投射
- **配对母题**：男性总是与女性配对
- 广泛分布 + 非凡情感性 = 基本心理因素
- 如微生物一样重要（发现前就如此）

**Core Points**:
- Brother Klaus saw God as both Father and Mother (heretical)
- Vision was spontaneous, not learned—proof of archetype
- Syzygy = masculine always paired with feminine
- Wide distribution proves fundamental psychic importance
- Archetypes operate like microbes—before we know them

**Narrative Snippets**:
- `[ns_cw9i_II_009]` `[trigger: klaus_vision]` `[factor_trigger: jung_syzygy]` `[role: 条件分支]` Brother Klaus saw God in dual form—majestic father AND jung_majestic mother—could not be more unorthodox, proving spontaneous archetypal vision. → ¶131
- `[ns_cw9i_II_010]` `[trigger: syzygy_proof]` `[factor_trigger: jung_syzygy]` `[role: 主干]` The syzygy motif expresses that masculine is always paired with feminine—its wide distribution and emotionality prove it is a fundamental psychic factor. → ¶134"""
