That is the age-old danger, instinctively known and feared by primitive man, who himself stands so very close to this pleroma. His consciousness is still uncertain, wobbling on its feet... Hence primitives are afraid of uncontrolled emotions, because consciousness breaks down under them and gives way to possession. All man's strivings have therefore been directed towards the consolidation of consciousness. This was the purpose of rite and dogma; they were dams and walls to keep back the dangers of the unconscious, the "perils of the soul."

In other words, night will fall, the light of consciousness is extinguished, and the dark sea of the unconscious breaks in.

**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Possession | Being taken over | Unconscious inflation | Primitive fear |
| Rite and dogma | Religious practices | Dams against unconscious | Consolidation of consciousness |
| Perils of the soul | Spiritual dangers | Unconscious threats | What barriers protect against |
| Factors | Makers/causes | Gods renamed | Modern term for archetypal forces |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**The danger of identification**:
The unconscious no sooner touches us than **we are it**—we become unconscious of ourselves. This is the age-old danger known to primitive man who stands close to the **pleroma** (fullness). His consciousness is uncertain, wobbling, childish, having just emerged from primal waters. A wave of the unconscious may roll over it—he forgets who he was and does strange things.

**Rite and dogma as protection**:
Primitives fear uncontrolled emotions because consciousness **breaks down** under them, giving way to **possession**. All human strivings have been directed toward **consolidating consciousness**. Rite and dogma are **dams and walls** against the dangers of the unconscious—the "perils of the soul." Primitive rites = exorcism, spell-lifting, averting evil omens, propitiation, purification.

**Church as barrier**:
These primitive barriers later became the **foundations of the Church**. When symbols become weak with age, these barriers collapse—waters rise and **boundless catastrophes** break over mankind. The Taos Pueblo elder warned: when our religion dies, "the sun won't rise any more"—night will fall, consciousness extinguished, dark sea of unconscious breaks in.

**Gods as factors**:
Mankind always stands on the brink of actions it performs but does not control. The whole world wants peace yet prepares for war. Today we call the gods **"factors"** (from facere, 'to make'). The makers stand behind the wings of the world-theatre. In consciousness we seem to be masters, but through the shadow's door we discover we are **objects of unseen factors**. The greatest danger comes from the psyche's **unpredictability**.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**认同的危险**：
无意识一触及我们，我们就**成为它**——我们变得对自己无意识。这是原始人所知道的古老危险，他站在**普累若玛**（丰满）附近。他的意识是不确定的、摇晃的、幼稚的，刚从原初之水中涌现。无意识的波浪可能淹没它——他忘记了自己是谁，做出奇怪的事情。

**仪式与教义作为保护**：
原始人害怕不受控制的情绪，因为意识在其下**崩溃**，让位于**附身**。所有人类努力都指向**巩固意识**。仪式和教义是对抗无意识危险的**堤坝和城墙**——"灵魂的危险"。原始仪式 = 驱魔、解咒、避凶兆、安抚、净化。

**教会作为屏障**：
这些原始屏障后来成为**教会的基础**。当象征因年久而变弱，这些屏障崩塌——水涨起来，**无边的灾难**降临人类。陶斯普韦布洛长老警告：当我们的宗教死去，"太阳将不再升起"——夜晚降临，意识熄灭，无意识的黑暗之海涌入。

**神祇作为因素**：
人类总是站在它自己执行但不控制的行动边缘。全世界都想要和平却都在备战。今天我们称神祇为**"因素"**（来自facere，"制造"）。制造者站在世界剧场的幕后。在意识中我们似乎是主人，但穿过阴影之门，我们惊恐地发现我们是**看不见的因素的客体**。最大的危险来自心灵的**不可预测性**。

**Core Points**:
- Unconscious touches us → we become it (identification danger)
- Primitive consciousness is uncertain, close to pleroma
- Wave of unconscious can roll over consciousness
- Primitives fear uncontrolled emotions → possession
- Rite and dogma = dams against unconscious dangers
- Primitive barriers became Church foundations
- When symbols weaken, barriers collapse → catastrophe
- Taos elder: religion dies → sun won't rise (consciousness lost)
- Mankind performs actions it doesn't control
- Gods now called "factors" (makers behind the scenes)
- Through shadow's door → we are objects of unseen factors
- Greatest danger = psyche's unpredictability
- Political delusional systems = decisions of collective unconscious

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: The Taos Pueblo story (¶48) comes from Jung's 1925 visit to New Mexico. This is one of his most cited cross-cultural examples. "Factors" (¶49) is a key Jungian move: demythologizing gods while preserving their psychological reality.
- **中文**: 陶斯普韦布洛故事（¶48）来自荣格1925年访问新墨西哥。这是他最常引用的跨文化例子之一。"因素"（¶49）是荣格的关键做法：去神话化神祇同时保留其心理现实。"""
