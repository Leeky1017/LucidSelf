**Key Term Analysis**:

| Term | Literal Meaning | Symbolic Significance | Contextual Usage |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Iconoclasm | Image-breaking | Destruction of sacred symbols | Reformation's psychological effect |
| Symbol poverty | Lack of living images | Modern spiritual crisis | Condition of Protestant life |
| Spiritual poverty | Lack of inner riches | Authentic starting point | Vow of psychological honesty |
| Spirit to water | Descent of fire | Spirit becoming unconscious | Heraclitean transformation |

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:

**Reformation as psychological breach**:
The Reformation's iconoclasm **literally made a breach** in the protective wall of sacred images. Since then, images have crumbled one after another—becoming dubious as they conflicted with awakening reason. People never really knew what Virgin Birth, Christ's divinity, or the Trinity **meant**—images just lived without reflection. Archetypal images are so packed with meaning that people never think to ask what they mean. **Gods die** when man discovers they seem to mean nothing—but really, he has merely discovered he never thought about his images at all.

**Chronic iconoclasm and symbol poverty**:
The history of Protestantism = **chronic iconoclasm**. Wall after wall fell. The "alarming poverty of symbols" is now the condition of our life. The Church became a fortress robbed of bastions, a house with walls plucked away, exposed to all winds.

**Eastern symbols as borrowed clothes**:
Can we put on like new clothes **ready-made symbols grown on foreign soil**—saturated with foreign blood, spoken in foreign tongue? Would this make us beggars wrapped in kingly raiment? The Romans imported Asiatic cults; Christianity fit the existing archetypal pattern. But can the West assimilate Eastern forms authentically?

**Avowing spiritual poverty**:
The impoverishment of symbols **has meaning**—inner consistency. We should **avow our spiritual poverty** rather than feign a legacy we didn't inherit. We are rightful heirs of Christian symbolism but have squandered it. The void gets filled with **absurd political and social ideas** distinguished by spiritual bleakness.

**Spirit descends to water**:
When natural inheritance dissipates, spirit descends from its fiery heights (Heraclitus). Spirit becomes heavy, turns to water. **Intellect usurps the seat where spirit once was enthroned**—but intellect is man's sword or hammer, not a creator of spiritual worlds, not a father of the soul.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

**宗教改革作为心理裂口**：
宗教改革的圣像破坏运动**字面意义上在神圣意象的保护墙上打开了裂口**。从那时起，意象一个接一个崩塌——与觉醒的理性相冲突而变得可疑。人们从未真正知道圣母诞生、基督神性或三位一体**意味着什么**——意象只是不经反思地存活着。原型意象本身充满意义，人们从不想问它们真正意味着什么。**神祇死亡**是当人发现它们似乎毫无意义时——但实际上，他只是发现自己从未思考过他的意象。

**慢性圣像破坏与象征贫乏**：
新教历史 = **慢性圣像破坏**。一道道墙壁倒塌。"令人震惊的象征贫乏"是我们生活的现状。教会成为失去堡垒的堡垒，墙壁被剥去的房屋，暴露在所有风中。

**东方象征作为借来的衣服**：
我们能像穿新衣一样穿上**在异国土地生长的现成象征**——浸透异国之血、用异国语言说、由异国文化滋养吗？这会使我们成为披着王袍的乞丐？罗马人进口亚洲崇拜；基督教符合现有的原型模式。但西方能真实地同化东方形式吗？

**承认精神贫困**：
象征贫乏**有其意义**——内在一致性。我们应该**承认我们的精神贫困**，而不是假装继承我们没有继承的遗产。我们是基督教象征主义的合法继承人，但已挥霍殆尽。空虚被**荒谬的政治和社会观念**填满，以精神荒芜著称。

**精神下沉为水**：
当自然遗产被挥霍，精神从其火焰高度下降（赫拉克利特）。精神变重，化为水。**智力篡夺了精神曾坐的位置**——但智力是人的剑或锤子，不是精神世界的创造者，不是灵魂之父。

**Core Points**:
- Reformation iconoclasm breached protective wall of sacred images
- Images crumbled when confronted with awakening reason
- People never really knew what archetypal images meant
- Gods die when meaning is questioned—but meaning was never examined
- Protestantism = chronic iconoclasm
- "Alarming poverty of symbols" = modern condition
- Eastern symbols cannot be worn like borrowed clothes
- Symbol poverty has inner consistency and meaning
- Better to avow spiritual poverty than feign false heritage
- Spirit descends to water when inheritance dissipated
- Intellect usurps spirit but is only sword/hammer, not creator

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: Jung's critique of Protestantism reflects his Swiss Reformed background. The Heraclitus reference (¶32) connects to Jung's lifelong interest in pre-Socratic philosophy. The "spirit descending to water" motif anticipates the water symbolism developed in ¶40ff.
- **中文**: 荣格对新教的批评反映了他的瑞士归正宗背景。赫拉克利特的引用（¶32）与荣格对前苏格拉底哲学的终身兴趣相关。"精神下沉为水"的母题预示了¶40ff发展的水象征主义。"""
