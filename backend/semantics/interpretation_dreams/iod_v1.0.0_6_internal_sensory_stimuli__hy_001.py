**Source Text**:

The subjective sensory stimuli as a source of the dream have the obvious advantage that unlike the objective stimuli they are independent of external accidents. The main proof for the dream-inciting power of subjective sensory excitements is offered by the so-called hypnagogic hallucinations, which have been described by John Müller as "phantastic visual manifestations." They are those very vivid and changeable pictures which occur regularly in many people during the period of falling asleep, and which may remain for awhile even after the eyes have been opened.

**English Paraphrase**:

Beyond external stimuli, dreams also arise from internal, subjective sensory excitations. The most compelling evidence for this comes from hypnagogic hallucinations—vivid, shifting images that many people experience while falling asleep. Johannes Müller described these as "phantastic visual manifestations." They can be so strong that they persist briefly even after opening one's eyes. These hallucinations provide a bridge between waking and dreaming, suggesting that the dreaming mind is already active during the transition to sleep.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

在讨论梦的来源时，弗洛伊德特别区分了**外部刺激**与**内部主观感官兴奋**。后者的关键例证，就是所谓“入睡幻觉”（hypnagogic hallucinations）：许多人在即将入睡时，会看到一连串生动、快速变换的图像——奇异的面孔、几何图案、风景片段，有时还伴随短暂的听觉幻象。这些现象往往甚至在睁开眼睛后仍短暂滞留，显示它们并非外界物体的投射，而是由内部感觉系统与心灵活动共同生成。

从精神分析角度看，入睡幻觉扮演了**清醒与梦之间的过渡地带**：一方面，外界输入逐渐减弱，内部神经与感觉系统的自发活动变得更为突出；另一方面，心理开始用这些零散的光点、线条与印象作为“原材料”，将其组织成更具意义的象与故事。研究者如 Maury 与 Ladd 的自我观察显示，这些入睡时看到的图像经常会直接延续、发展为后续的梦境内容，仿佛一部歌剧的序曲先呈示了主旋律。

这说明：梦并不需要强烈的外部刺激才会发生，**心灵自身的感觉与神经活动就足以点燃整套造梦机制**。简单的光斑、噪音或躯体感觉，会在无意识加工下被转化为完整的幻觉场景——这既强调了梦的内源性，也为后文“梦的工作如何把原始刺激转为有意义的叙事”提供了重要线索。

**Core Points**:
- Subjective internal stimuli independent of external events
- Hypnagogic hallucinations: vivid images during sleep onset
- Described by Johannes Müller as "phantastic visual manifestations"
- Can persist briefly after opening eyes
- Bridge between waking and dreaming states
- Demonstrate dream mechanisms are active during transition

**Detailed Explanation**:

Freud introduces **hypnagogic hallucinations** (from Greek hypnos = sleep, agogos = leading into) as crucial evidence that dreams originate from internal mental processes, not just external stimulation.

**Phenomenology**: As consciousness dims toward sleep, many people experience:
- Vivid, rapidly changing visual images
- Faces, patterns, landscapes appearing spontaneously
- Images that seem to have their own momentum and logic
- Sometimes auditory hallucinations (words, names, sounds)

**Maury's Observations**: Alfred Maury studied his own hypnagogic experiences extensively:

1. **Grotesque Faces**: During sleep onset, distorted faces with strange headdresses "obtruded themselves with incredible importunity." Upon awakening from a brief sleep, he found these same images had become part of his dream.

2. **Hunger Hallucination**: While on a strict diet, he saw hypnagogically a plate and a fork taking food. His subsequent dream placed him at an abundant table, hearing the clatter of diners' forks.

3. **Eye Strain**: With irritated, painful eyes, he had hypnagogic visions of microscopic characters requiring effortful deciphering. His dream an hour later repeated this: an open book with tiny letters requiring laborious reading.

**Continuity Principle**: Hypnagogic images often continue directly into dreams, like an "overture announcing the principal motive of the opera which is to follow." This suggests dream formation begins before sleep fully arrives.

**G. Trumbull Ladd's Research**: Through practiced self-awakening 2-5 minutes after sleep onset, Ladd compared retinal phosphenes (spontaneous light patterns in the eye) with dream imagery. He found:
- Dream visual content correlates with retinal light patterns
- The retina's "luminous dots and lines" provide the outline or skeleton
- The psyche then elaborates these patterns into meaningful images
- A dream of reading printed text corresponded to parallel lines of retinal phosphenes

**Theoretical Significance**:

1. **Internal Generation**: Dreams don't require external stimuli—the mind can generate rich imagery from its own spontaneous neural activity.

2. **Transformation Process**: Simple sensory patterns (retinal phosphenes, tinnitus) are transformed into complex, meaningful imagery. This transformation is the dream-work's essence.

3. **Continuity of Consciousness**: No sharp boundary exists between waking, hypnagogic, and dreaming states—consciousness gradually transitions, with dream mechanisms active throughout.

4. **Visual Dominance**: Visual imagery predominates in dreams because the retina provides continuous internal stimulation even in darkness.

Freud is establishing that dreams involve active psychological processes that transform raw sensory material (both external and internal) into meaningful narratives. This sets the stage for his theory that dreams aren't just passive responses to stimuli but active constructions serving psychological purposes.
