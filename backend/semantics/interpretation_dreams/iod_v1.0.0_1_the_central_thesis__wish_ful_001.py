**Source Text**:

When the work of interpretation has been completed the dream can be recognized as a wish fulfillment. In the dream of Irma's injection I can at once discover a wish that the interpretation fulfills. I wish not to be responsible for the pains which Irma still suffers. The dream acquits me of this responsibility by attributing her illness to other causes. The dream represents a certain state of affairs as I would wish it; its content is the fulfillment of a wish, its motive is a wish.

**English Paraphrase**:

Freud's revolutionary claim: **Every dream is a wish-fulfillment**. When properly interpreted through free association, dreams reveal themselves as imaginary satisfactions of wishes—conscious or unconscious. In Freud's famous "Irma's injection" dream, he wished to avoid responsibility for a patient's ongoing suffering. The dream fulfilled this wish by creating a scenario where others were responsible. The dream's content represents reality as the dreamer wishes it to be; its motive is always a wish seeking fulfillment.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

在第二章确立方法之后，弗洛伊德在这里给出了整本书的**核心命题**：每一个梦，归根到底，都是某种愿望的满足。所谓“满足”，并非在现实中真正获得，而是在梦的情境中“仿佛已经实现了”；所谓“愿望”，也绝不限于清醒时自觉的想要，而包括被压抑的童年欲望、违背道德或自我形象的冲动，以及种种模糊而矛盾的内在要求。

以他著名的“伊尔玛注射”之梦为例：在现实中，他对于病人疗效不佳心怀不安，希望证明自己没有责任；梦中，他通过一连串医学细节和他人诊断，把责任成功推给“错误药物”“他人疏忽”“躯体疾病”等外因，从而在梦里体验到“我并无过错”的轻松感——这正是愿望在幻觉层面的完成。

在儿童梦中，这种愿望满足往往极为直白：想吃却被禁止的樱桃、未能成行的郊游，几乎原样出现在梦里，显示出“想要什么，梦里就得到什么”的透明结构。成人梦之所以看起来复杂、甚至令人痛苦，是因为成人的愿望本身已经**冲突化与道德化**：同一主体既渴望又恐惧、既想占有又怕受罚，于是梦必须在审查压力下用凝缩、移置、象征等方式把欲望扭曲、拆分和隐藏。

因此，弗洛伊德所谓“每个梦都是愿望满足”，并不是天真的乐观论，而是一种关于梦的基本功能的陈述：梦通过提供一种幻觉性的场景，让那些在现实中难以或不允许被满足的冲动，得以在内在舞台上暂时获得一种“好像满足了”的体验，从而既为心灵卸压，又维持睡眠不被强行打断。

**Core Points**:
- Central thesis: ALL dreams are wish-fulfillments
- Dreams imaginatively satisfy wishes (conscious or unconscious)
- Dream content = reality as dreamer wishes it
- Dream motive = a wish seeking satisfaction
- Applies to pleasant and unpleasant dreams (complex wish structure)
- Children's dreams show this most clearly (simple wishes)
- Adult dreams disguise wishes through dream-work

**Detailed Explanation**:

This is Freud's most controversial and revolutionary claim. Not just some dreams, but **every dream** fulfills a wish. This seems implausible—what about nightmares, anxiety dreams, unpleasant dreams?

**The Irma's Injection Dream**: Freud's first major example. The dreamer (Freud himself) worries he's mistreated a patient named Irma, whose symptoms persist. He wishes to be exonerated. The dream stages an elaborate scenario where:
- Irma's illness has organic causes (not psychological)
- Other doctors are responsible
- Freud is absolved of blame

The dream grants the wish: "I am not responsible."

**Simple vs Complex Wish-Fulfillment**:

**Children's Dreams**: Direct, transparent wish-fulfillments. A child denied cherries dreams of eating cherries. A child prevented from a mountain excursion dreams of the excursion. The wish is obvious, the fulfillment undisguised.

**Adult Dreams**: More complex. Wishes are:
- Often unconscious (not known to dreamer)
- Morally unacceptable (require disguise)
- Conflicted (multiple contradictory wishes)
- Censored (distorted by dream-work)

**What About Unpleasant Dreams?**: Freud's answer: Even nightmares fulfill wishes, but:
1. **Punishment wishes**: Self-punishing dreams fulfill wishes to suffer (guilt-driven)
2. **Lesser evil**: Anxiety dream may fulfill wish to avoid greater fear
3. **Disguised wishes**: Apparent suffering masks forbidden satisfaction
4. **Failed censorship**: Dream-work's disguise partially fails, causing anxiety

**The Wish Concept**: Crucially, "wish" doesn't mean conscious desire. It includes:
- Repressed infantile wishes
- Unconscious impulses
- Forbidden desires
- Conflicted longings

The dream provides **hallucinatory satisfaction** of what reality denies. It's the mind's way of maintaining sleep by imaginatively fulfilling disturbing wishes rather than waking to act on them.

**Theoretical Significance**: This theory makes dreams meaningful psychological products, not mere by-products of sleep. Dreams reveal the unconscious mind's wishes, conflicts, and defensive operations—making them the "royal road to the unconscious."

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Wish-Fulfillment Thesis: Every dream satisfies a wish. Children's dreams=transparent. Adult dreams=disguised by dream-work. Unpleasant dreams fulfill punishment wishes or reflect failed censorship. Wishes include unconscious/repressed impulses.
- **中文**: 愿望满足命题:每个梦满足一个愿望。儿童梦=透明。成人梦=被梦的工作伪装。不愉快梦满足惩罚愿望或反映审查失败。愿望包括无意识/压抑的冲动。
