**Source Text**:

The forgetting of dreams is treated in the most detailed manner by Strümpell. This forgetting is evidently a complex phenomenon; for Strümpell does not explain it by a single reason, but by a considerable number of reasons. Dream pictures are forgotten because they are too weak, while stronger pictures in proximity will be remembered. Besides, in the waking state one is wont to forget easily what happened only once, and to note more easily things of repeated occurrence. But most dream pictures are single experiences, and this peculiarity equally contributes towards the forgetting of all dreams.

**English Paraphrase**:

Why do we forget most dreams? Strümpell identifies multiple factors: (1) Weak intensity—faint dream images fade like weak waking memories. (2) Single occurrence—dreams are unique, one-time experiences, unlike repeated waking events that consolidate in memory. (3) Lack of coherence—dreams lack logical connections that aid memory retention. (4) Isolation from waking life—dreams float "like clouds" without anchoring to daytime mental sequences. (5) Attention shift—upon waking, sensory reality floods consciousness, overwhelming fragile dream memories. (6) Lack of interest—those who don't value dreams forget them more readily.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:

弗洛伊德借 Strümpell 的分析，系统梳理了梦为何“来时轰烈、去时无踪”的多重原因。首先，从**物理强度**看，许多梦像清醒时的微弱印象一样，本身就不够鲜明，很容易在新的刺激到来时迅速褪色。其次，梦通常是一次性事件——只做一遍，很少重复；而清醒记忆往往通过反复提及和再现而被加固，缺乏重复，使梦天然处于易逝状态。

第三，梦的内容普遍**缺乏逻辑连贯性**，情节突兀跳跃，场景与人物快速更换，不像有因有果的故事那样易于在记忆中“挂钩”；这与诗句错乱排列后难以背诵如出一辙。第四，梦与日常思维链条之间往往是**隔离的**——梦被形容为“像从我们心灵土壤中升起、悬浮在空中的云朵”，醒来后我们很难把它安置在清醒生活的时间序列中，因而缺乏可以附着的记忆节点。

此外，**醒来时注意力的骤然转移**也起关键作用：外界感官信息蜂拥而入，如同日光淹没星光，使得本就脆弱的梦痕一瞬间被冲淡。最后，**兴趣本身也是记忆的助力**——不重视梦的人，即使梦境再鲜明，也会因缺乏回想与记录而迅速遗忘；而研究梦的人则因持续关注而保留更多细节。

在这些表层解释之后，弗洛伊德提出更深一层的看法：梦之所以难以记住，并不只是因为它弱、不连贯或被新刺激覆盖，而是因为许多梦承载了**意识不愿正视的愿望与冲突**。遗忘本身也可能是一种防御——在梦中被突破的东西，醒来后再度被压回深处。因此，“梦的遗忘”既是记忆机制的结果，更是心理抵抗的继续。

**Core Points**:
- Multiple factors cause dream forgetting (complex phenomenon)
- Weak intensity: faint images fade quickly
- Single occurrence: unlike repeated waking experiences
- Lack of logical coherence makes dreams hard to retain
- Isolation from waking mental sequences (dreams float like clouds)
- Attention shift upon waking overwhelms dream memories
- Interest level affects retention: investigators remember more

**Detailed Explanation**:

Freud presents the **paradox of dream memory**: dreams feel vivid while occurring, yet we forget most within minutes of waking. Understanding this paradox reveals something about dreams' relationship to consciousness.

**Strümpell's Factors**:

1. **Intensity**: Dream images vary in vividness. Weak images fade immediately, like faint waking impressions. But even vivid dreams can be forgotten, so intensity alone doesn't determine retention.

2. **Single Occurrence**: Waking memories strengthen through repetition. Dreams are typically unique events, experienced once and never repeated identically. This makes them inherently fragile.

3. **Lack of Coherence**: Memory depends on associative connections. A verse is easy to remember when words connect logically; mixed randomly, the same words become forgettable. **Dreams lack sense and order**—they crumble together "the very next moment." Their compositions are "by their very nature incapable of being remembered."

4. **Isolation from Waking Sequences**: The dream "rises from the soil of our psychic life and floats in psychic space like a cloud in the sky." It doesn't integrate into the continuous narrative of waking mental life. Upon waking, we cannot locate dreams within our normal thought sequences, so they have "no place in the company of psychic successions."

5. **Attention Capture**: "Upon awakening, attention is immediately seized by the inrushing sensory world." Dream memories "fade before the impressions of the new day like the glow of stars before sunlight."

6. **Interest**: Those investigating dreams remember more—not because they dream more, but because they value and attend to dreams. Interest itself strengthens retention.

**The Distortion Problem**: Even dreams we "remember" may be distorted. Jessen warns that "we almost always play with the truth when we recall a dream." **The mind unconsciously fills gaps, supplements images, and imposes logical connections** that the actual dream lacked. We become "artists unawares," creating a coherent narrative from disconnected fragments.

This raises a methodological problem: If memory distorts dreams, how can we study them scientifically? Freud will answer by developing techniques (free association, immediate recording) that minimize distortion.

**Freud's Implicit Theory**: Why do dreams resist memory? Not just because they're weak or incoherent—these are symptoms, not causes. The deeper reason (Freud will argue) is **resistance**: dreams express wishes consciousness finds unacceptable. Forgetting serves defensive purposes. The dream-work disguises forbidden wishes; forgetting provides additional protection.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Dream Forgetting: Multiple factors (intensity, single occurrence, incoherence, isolation, attention shift, interest). Deeper cause=resistance. Forgetting serves defensive purpose. Memory distortion also occurs.
- **中文**: 梦的遗忘:多重因素(强度、一次性、不连贯、隔离、注意力转移、兴趣)。深层原因=抵抗。遗忘服务于防御目的。记忆扭曲也会发生。
