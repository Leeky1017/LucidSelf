**Source Text**:
> "The gallows from which he is suspended forms a Tau cross, while the figure--from the position of the legs--forms a fylfot cross. There is a nimbus about the head of the seeming martyr. It should be noted (1) that the tree of sacrifice is living wood, with leaves thereon; (2) that the face expresses deep entrancement, not suffering; (3) that the figure, as a whole, suggests life in suspension, but life and not death. It is a card of profound significance, but all the significance is veiled. One of his editors suggests that Éliphas Lévi did not know the meaning, which is unquestionable nor did the editor himself. It has been called falsely a card of martyrdom, a card a of prudence, a card of the Great Work, a card of duty; but we may exhaust all published interpretations and find only vanity. I will say very simply on my own part that it expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe.

> He who can understand that the story of his higher nature is imbedded in this symbolism will receive intimations concerning a great awakening that is possible, and will know that after the sacred Mystery of Death there is a glorious Mystery of Resurrection."

**English Paraphrase**:
**The Veiled Mystery of Sacrifice** – The Hanged Man forms two crosses: the gallows is a **Tau cross (T)**, and his legs form a **fylfot cross** (swastika/ancient solar symbol, 4-fold rotation). A **nimbus (halo) surrounds his head** – sanctity, not punishment.

Three crucial observations Waite makes:
**(1)** The tree is **living wood with leaves** – not dead gallows but living Tree of Life, sacrifice bringing life.
**(2)** His face shows **deep entrancement, not suffering** – mystical ecstasy, not agony.
**(3)** The whole figure suggests **life in suspension, but life and not death** – suspended animation, pause before transformation, not termination.

Waite declares: **"It is a card of profound significance, but all the significance is veiled."** He dismisses all previous interpretations – Éliphas Lévi **"did not know the meaning,"** nor did anyone else. Past labels (**martyrdom, prudence, Great Work, duty**) are **"vanity"** – empty words.

Waite reveals only this: **"It expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe"** – the cosmos suspended from/in God, creation as divine self-limitation (tzimtzum), the necessary "sacrifice" of the Infinite becoming finite.

His final hint: **"He who can understand that the story of his higher nature is imbedded in this symbolism will receive intimations concerning a great awakening that is possible, and will know that after the sacred Mystery of Death there is a glorious Mystery of Resurrection."** The card encodes the soul's highest potential – voluntary suspension/sacrifice leads to resurrection/awakening.

#### Core Points

- **Veiled Profound Mystery**: It is a card of profound significance, but all the significance is veiled.
- **Living Wood**: The tree of sacrifice is living wood with leaves—sacrifice brings life, not death.
- **Entrancement Not Suffering**: The face expresses deep entrancement, not suffering—mystical ecstasy, not agony.
- **Life in Suspension**: The figure suggests life in suspension, but life and not death.
- **Divine-Universe Relation**: It expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe.

#### Detailed Explanation

The Hanged Man forms two crosses: the gallows is a Tau cross (T), and his legs form a fylfot cross (ancient solar symbol). A nimbus surrounds his head—sanctity, not punishment.

Three crucial observations: (1) The tree is living wood with leaves—not dead gallows but living Tree of Life, sacrifice bringing life; (2) His face shows deep entrancement, not suffering—mystical ecstasy, not agony; (3) The whole figure suggests life in suspension, but life and not death.

Waite declares: "It is a card of profound significance, but all the significance is veiled." He dismisses all previous interpretations—martyrdom, prudence, Great Work, duty—as "vanity." He reveals only: "It expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and the Universe."

His final hint: "He who can understand that the story of his higher nature is imbedded in this symbolism will receive intimations concerning a great awakening... after the sacred Mystery of Death there is a glorious Mystery of Resurrection."

**Chinese Explanation**:
**吊人（隐蔽的牺牲奥秘）**——吊人形成两个十字：绞架是**Tau十字（T）**，他的腿形成**卐字十字**（fylfot，古代太阳符号，四重旋转）。他头部有**光环（nimbus）**——神圣性，非惩罚。

韦特做出的三个关键观察：
**(1)** 树是**有叶的活木**——非死绞架而是活生命之树，牺牲带来生命。
**(2)** 他的面容显示**深度迷醉，非痛苦**——神秘狂喜，非痛楚。
**(3)** 整体形象暗示**悬置中的生命，是生命而非死亡**——暂停的动画，转化前的停顿，非终结。

韦特宣告：**"这是一张具有深刻意义的牌，但所有意义都被隐蔽"**。他驳斥所有先前诠释——Éliphas Lévi**"不知道其含义"**，其他人也不知道。过往标签（**殉难、谨慎、大工作、职责**）是**"虚空"**——空洞言辞。

韦特仅揭示：**"它在某一面向上表达了神圣与宇宙之间的关系"**——宇宙悬挂于/在神中，创造作为神圣自我限制（tzimtzum），无限变为有限的必要"牺牲"。

他的最终暗示：**"能理解其更高本性故事嵌于此象征中的人，将获得关于一种可能的伟大觉醒的暗示，并将知道在神圣死亡奥秘之后有荣耀的复活奥秘"**。此牌编码灵魂的最高潜能——自愿悬置/牺牲导向复活/觉醒。

**In Readings**: Pause, surrender, sacrifice, seeing from different perspective, suspension before breakthrough, but reminder: this is voluntary sacrifice (entrancement), not victimhood; veiled deep transformation.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Waite dismisses all prior interpretations (martyrdom, prudence, Great Work, duty) as "vanity." Key observations: living wood, entrancement not suffering, life in suspension. "Relation between Divine and Universe" is only revealed meaning. Great awakening possible; resurrection after mystical death.
- **中文**: 韦特驳斥所有先前诠释（殉难、谨慎、大工作、职责）为"虚空"。关键观察：活木、迷醉非痛苦、悬置中生命。“神圣与宇宙关系”是唯一揭示含义。伟大觉醒可能；神秘死亡后复活。
