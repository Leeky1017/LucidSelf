**Source Text**:
> "The veil or mask of life is perpetuated in change, transformation and passage from lower to higher, and this is more fitly represented in the rectified Tarot by one of the apocalyptic visions than by the crude notion of the reaping skeleton. Behind it lies the whole world of ascent in the spirit. The mysterious horseman moves slowly, bearing a black banner emblazoned with the Mystic Rose, which signifies life. Between two pillars on the verge of the horizon there shines the sun of immortality. The horseman carries no visible weapon, but king and child and maiden fall before him, while a prelate with clasped hands awaits his end.

> There should be no need to point out that the suggestion of death which I have made in connection with the previous card is, of course, to be understood mystically, but this is not the case in the present instance. The natural transit of man to the next stage of his being either is or may be one form of his progress, but the exotic and almost unknown entrance, while still in this life, into the state of mystical death is a change in the form of consciousness and the passage into a state to which ordinary death is neither the path nor gate. The existing occult explanations of the 13th card are, on the whole, better than usual, rebirth, creation, destination, renewal, and the rest."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Mystical Death and Transformation** – Waite rejects the **"crude notion of the reaping skeleton,"** instead depicting **"one of the apocalyptic visions"** – a **mysterious horseman moving slowly** with a **black banner emblazoned with the Mystic Rose, which signifies life**. Death carries life-symbol, not destruction-symbol.

Between **two pillars on the horizon shines the sun of immortality** – death as passage to eternal life, not annihilation. The horseman **carries no visible weapon**, yet **king, child, and maiden fall** before him, while **a prelate with clasped hands awaits his end** – death is universal, sparing none, requiring no force.

Waite distinguishes two forms of "death":
**(1) Natural transit** – **"the natural transit of man to the next stage of his being"** – ordinary physical death as **"one form of his progress."**
**(2) Mystical death** – **"the exotic and almost unknown entrance, while still in this life, into the state of mystical death"** – **"a change in the form of consciousness"** and **"passage into a state to which ordinary death is neither the path nor gate."** This is spiritual death-rebirth (initiation, ego-death, consciousness transformation) **while still alive**, not requiring physical death.

The card represents **"the veil or mask of life perpetuated in change, transformation and passage from lower to higher"** – behind it lies **"the whole world of ascent in the spirit."** Death is transformation, elevation, spiritual ascent.

Waite approves existing interpretations: **"rebirth, creation, destination, renewal"** – these are **"on the whole, better than usual."**

#### Core Points

- **Mystical vs Natural Death**: Two forms—natural transit to next stage vs mystical death while still in this life.
- **Mystic Rose**: The black banner displays the Mystic Rose, which signifies life—death carries life symbol.
- **Sun of Immortality**: Between two pillars on the horizon shines the sun of immortality—passage to eternal life.
- **Change in Consciousness**: Mystical death is a change in the form of consciousness, a passage into a state to which ordinary death is neither path nor gate.
- **Passage Lower to Higher**: The veil of life is perpetuated in change, transformation, and passage from lower to higher.

#### Detailed Explanation

Waite rejects the "crude notion of the reaping skeleton," instead depicting "one of the apocalyptic visions"—a mysterious horseman moving slowly with a black banner emblazoned with the Mystic Rose, which signifies life. Death carries life-symbol, not destruction-symbol.

Between two pillars on the horizon shines the sun of immortality—death as passage to eternal life, not annihilation. The horseman carries no visible weapon, yet king, child, and maiden fall before him, while a prelate awaits his end—death is universal, requiring no force.

Waite distinguishes two forms: (1) Natural transit—ordinary physical death as "one form of his progress"; (2) Mystical death—"the exotic and almost unknown entrance, while still in this life, into the state of mystical death"—"a change in the form of consciousness" and "passage into a state to which ordinary death is neither the path nor gate."

**Chinese Explanation**:
**死神（神秘死亡与转化）**——韦特拒绝**"收割骷髅的粗糙概念"**，改为描绘**"天启异象之一"**——**缓慢移动的神秘骑士**持**黑旗上绣神秘玫瑰，象征生命**。死神携带生命符号，非毁灭符号。

**两根柱子间的地平线上闪耀不朽之日**——死亡作为通向永生的通道，非湮灭。骑士**不携带可见武器**，然而**国王、孩童、少女倒下**，而**教士双手合十等待终结**——死亡普世，无人幸免，无需武力。

韦特区分两种"死亡"：
**(1) 自然过渡**——**"人类向其存在下一阶段的自然过渡"**——普通肉体死亡作为**"其进步的一种形式"**。
**(2) 神秘死亡**——**"在此生中进入神秘死亡状态的异国而几乎未知的入口"**——**"意识形式的改变"**和**"进入一个普通死亡既非路径也非门户的状态"**。这是灵性死亡-重生（启蒙、自我死亡、意识转化）**仍在活着时**，不需要肉体死亡。

此牌代表**"生命的面纱或面具在变化、转化及从低向高的通道中延续"**——其背后是**"灵性上升的整个世界"**。死亡是转化、提升、灵性上升。

韦特认可现有诠释：**"重生、创造、目的地、更新"**——这些**"总体上比通常更好"**。

**In Readings**: Endings leading to new beginnings, transformation, release, renewal, but remember: mystical death (consciousness shift) possible in this life, not just physical death; death carries life (Mystic Rose).

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Waite rejects "crude notion of reaping skeleton" for apocalyptic vision. Mystic Rose on black banner signifies life. Key distinction: natural transit (physical) vs mystical death (consciousness change in this life). Approves "rebirth, creation, renewal" interpretations.
- **中文**: 韦特拒绝“收割骷髅的粗糙概念”而用天启异象。黑旗神秘玫瑰象征生命。关键区分：自然过渡（肉体）vs神秘死亡（此生意识转变）。认可“重生、创造、更新”诠释。
