**Source Text**:
> "As this card follows the traditional symbolism and carries above all its obvious meanings, there is little to say regarding it outside the few considerations collected in the first part, to which the reader is referred. It will be seen, however, that the figure is seated between pillars, like the High Priestess, and on this account it seems desirable to indicate that the moral principle which deals unto every man according to his works--while, of course, it is in strict analogy with higher things;--differs in its essence from the spiritual justice which is involved in the idea of election. The latter belongs to a mysterious order of Providence, in virtue of which it is possible for certain men to conceive the idea of dedication to the highest things. The operation of this is like the breathing of the Spirit where it wills, and we have no canon of criticism or ground of explanation concerning it. It is analogous to the possession of the fairy gifts and the high gifts and the gracious gifts of the poet: we have them or have not, and their presence is as much a mystery as their absence. The law of Justice is not however involved by either alternative. In conclusion, the pillars of Justice open into one world and the pillars of the High Priestess into another."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Moral vs Spiritual Justice** – Justice sits **between pillars, like the High Priestess**, but Waite emphasizes they open into **different worlds**. Justice represents **"the moral principle which deals unto every man according to his works"** – karmic law, cause and effect, moral accountability.

This **"differs in its essence from the spiritual justice which is involved in the idea of election."** Election (divine choosing/grace) belongs to a **"mysterious order of Providence"** – why certain souls are called to dedication to the highest things. This operates **"like the breathing of the Spirit where it wills"** (John 3:8: "The wind blows where it wishes") – **"we have no canon of criticism or ground of explanation concerning it."**

Waite's analogy: Election is like **"the possession of the fairy gifts and the high gifts and the gracious gifts of the poet: we have them or have not, and their presence is as much a mystery as their absence."** These are not earned but given by grace – unmerited spiritual election.

Crucially: **"The law of Justice is not however involved by either alternative."** Moral justice (works/karma) operates independently of spiritual election (grace). Two parallel orders.

Final distinction: **"The pillars of Justice open into one world and the pillars of the High Priestess into another."** Justice = moral/karmic realm; High Priestess = grace/mystery realm.

#### Core Points

- **Moral vs Spiritual Justice**: The moral principle deals unto every man according to his works, differing from spiritual justice involved in election.
- **Election as Mystery**: Spiritual election belongs to a mysterious order of Providence—the Spirit breathing where it wills.
- **Fairy Gifts Analogy**: Election is like the fairy gifts of the poet: we have them or have not, their presence as mysterious as absence.
- **Two Parallel Orders**: The law of Justice is not involved by either alternative—moral and spiritual justice operate independently.
- **Different Pillars**: The pillars of Justice open into one world, the pillars of the High Priestess into another.

#### Detailed Explanation

Justice sits between pillars, like the High Priestess, but Waite emphasizes they open into different worlds. Justice represents "the moral principle which deals unto every man according to his works"—karmic law, cause and effect, moral accountability.

This "differs in its essence from the spiritual justice which is involved in the idea of election." Election belongs to a "mysterious order of Providence"—why certain souls are called to dedication to the highest things. This operates "like the breathing of the Spirit where it wills"—"we have no canon of criticism or ground of explanation concerning it."

Waite's analogy: Election is like "the possession of the fairy gifts and the high gifts and the gracious gifts of the poet: we have them or have not." Crucially: "The law of Justice is not however involved by either alternative." Moral justice operates independently of spiritual election.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**正义（道德vs灵性正义）**——正义坐在**柱子之间，如女祭司**，但韦特强调它们通向**不同世界**。正义代表**"按各人行为对待的道德原则"**——业力法则、因果、道德问责。

这**"在本质上不同于与拣选理念相关的灵性正义"**。拣选（神圣选择/恩典）属于**"天意的神秘秩序"**——为何某些灵魂被呼召奉献于至高事物。这运作**"如圣灵随意吹气"**（约翰3:8："风随意吹"）——**"我们对此没有批评标准或解释根据"**。

韦特的类比：拣选如同**"仙女恩赐、高等恩赐、诗人优雅恩赐的拥有：我们有或没有，它们的存在如同它们的缺席一样神秘"**。这些不是赚得的，而是恩典赐予——无功的灵性拣选。

关键：**"正义法则不涉及任一选择"**。道德正义（行为/业力）独立于灵性拣选（恩典）运作。两个平行秩序。

最终区分：**"正义之柱通向一个世界，女祭司之柱通向另一个"**。正义=道德/业力领域；女祭司=恩典/奥秘领域。

**In Readings**: Fairness, legal matters, cause-effect, accountability, moral balance, but remember: this is moral justice (works), not spiritual election (grace).

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Waite distinguishes moral justice ("according to works") from spiritual election ("Spirit breathing where it wills"). Election like "fairy gifts" - we have or have not. "Pillars of Justice open into one world, pillars of High Priestess into another."
- **中文**: 韦特区分道德正义（"按行为"）与灵性拣选（"圣灵随意吹"）。拣选如"仙女恩赐"—有或没有。"正义之柱通向一个世界，女祭司之柱通向另一个"。
