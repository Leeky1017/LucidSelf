**Source Text**:
> "The Horned Goat of Mendes, with wings like those of a bat, is standing on an altar. At the pit of the stomach there is the sign of Mercury. The right hand is upraised and extended, being the reverse of that benediction which is given by the Hierophant in the fifth card. In the left hand there is a great flaming torch, inverted towards the earth. A reversed pentagram is on the forehead. There is a ring in front of the altar, from which two chains are carried to the necks of two figures, male and female. These are analogous with those of the fifth card, as if Adam and Eve after the Fall. Hereof is the chain and fatality of the material life.

> The figures are tailed, to signify the animal nature, but there is human intelligence in the faces, and he who is exalted above them is not to be their master for ever. Even now, he is also a bondsman, sustained by the evil that is in him and blind to the liberty of service. With more than his usual derision for the arts which he pretended to respect and interpret as a master therein, Éliphas Lévi affirms that the Baphometic figure is occult science and magic. Another commentator says that in the Divine world it signifies predestination, but there is no correspondence in that world with the things which below are of the brute. What it does signify is the Dweller on the Threshold without the Mystical Garden when those are driven forth therefrom who have eaten the forbidden fruit."

**English Paraphrase**:
**The Dweller on the Threshold** – The **Horned Goat of Mendes** (Baphomet) with **bat wings** stands on altar, bearing **Mercury sign at stomach** (mind/communication), **reversed pentagram on forehead** (spirit subordinated to matter). Right hand gives **reverse benediction** (opposite of Hierophant's blessing – curse instead of grace), left hand holds **flaming torch inverted toward earth** (spiritual fire directed downward, not upward).

**Two chained figures** (male and female, **tailed to signify animal nature**) are **"analogous with those of the fifth card, as if Adam and Eve after the Fall"** – the Hierophant's acolytes transformed into Devil's captives. **"Hereof is the chain and fatality of the material life"** – bondage to materialism.

Critical insight: The figures **"are tailed... but there is human intelligence in the faces"** – not fully degraded, retaining consciousness. The Devil **"is not to be their master for ever"** – temporary bondage, not eternal damnation. **"Even now, he is also a bondsman, sustained by the evil that is in him and blind to the liberty of service"** – the Devil himself is enslaved by his own evil nature.

Waite dismisses Lévi's claim that the Baphomet represents **"occult science and magic"** with **"more than his usual derision."** Another's claim of **"predestination"** is refuted: **"there is no correspondence in that [Divine] world with the things which below are of the brute."** Divine realm has no connection to brutish material bondage.

Waite's definition: **"What it does signify is the Dweller on the Threshold without the Mystical Garden when those are driven forth therefrom who have eaten the forbidden fruit."** The Devil is the **guardian/tempter at the boundary** of the lost paradise – exile from Eden, state after the Fall, but **outside** (not inside) the sacred garden.

**Core**: **Material Bondage & Post-Fall State** – Chain of material life, Adam/Eve after Fall, temporary (not eternal) bondage, Devil also enslaved, Dweller on Threshold outside Mystical Garden.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**魔鬼（门槛上的居住者）**——**门德斯有角山羊**（Baphomet）带**蝙蝠翅膀**站在祭坛上，腹部有**水星符号**（心智/沟通），**额头倒五芒星**（灵性从属于物质）。右手做**反向祝福**（与教皇祝福相反——诅咒而非恩典），左手持**倒向地球的火焰炬**（灵性之火向下而非向上）。

**两个被链条锁住的人物**（男女，**有尾表示动物本性**）**"类似第五张牌的人物，如堕落后的亚当与夏娃"**——教皇的侍从转化为魔鬼的俘虏。**"这是物质生活的链条与宿命"**——对物质主义的束缚。

关键洞察：这些人物**"有尾......但面容有人类智慧"**——非完全堕落，保留意识。魔鬼**"不会永远做他们的主人"**——暂时束缚，非永恒诅咒。**"即便现在，他也是奴仆，被其内在的恶支撑，对服务的自由视而不见"**——魔鬼自己被其邪恶本性奴役。

韦特以**"比其通常更多的嘲讽"**驳斥Lévi声称Baphomet代表**"神秘学与魔法"**。另一人的**"预定论"**主张被反驳：**"在那个[神圣]世界中，与下面野蛮之事物没有对应"**。神圣领域与粗鄙物质束缚无关。

韦特的定义：**"它确实象征的是当那些吃了禁果的人被驱逐时，神秘花园外门槛上的居住者"**。魔鬼是失落乐园**边界的守护者/诱惑者**——流放伊甸园，堕落后状态，但在**外面**（非里面）神圣花园。

**In Readings**: Bondage, addiction, materialism, illusion, but remember: temporary not eternal, human intelligence remains, even Devil is enslaved by his own nature, state outside (not in) Mystical Garden.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Waite rejects Lévi's "occult science and magic" with "more than his usual derision." Devil is "Dweller on the Threshold without the Mystical Garden." Figures have tails but "human intelligence in faces" - not fully degraded. Devil "also a bondsman, sustained by the evil that is in him."
- **中文**: 韦特以"比平常更多嘲讽"驳斥Lévi的"神秘学与魔法"。魔鬼是"神秘花园外门槛上的居住者"。人物有尾但"面容有人类智慧"—非完全堕落。魔鬼"也是奴仆，被其内在的恶支撑"。
