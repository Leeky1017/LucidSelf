**Source Text**:
> "A winged angel, with the sign of the sun upon his forehead and on his breast the square and triangle of the septenary. I speak of him in the masculine sense, but the figure is neither male nor female. It is held to be pouring the essences of life from chalice to chalice. It has one foot upon the earth and one upon the waters, thus illustrating the nature of the essences. A direct path goes up to certain heights on the verge of the horizon, and above there is a great light, through the midst of which a crown is seen vaguely. Hereof is some part of the Secret of Eternal Life, as it is possible to man in his incarnation. All the conventional emblems are renounced herein.

> The name Temperance is now almost an impeachment of the truth therein, for the card has nothing to do with that virtue in any ordinary or accepted meaning. When the rule of it obtains in our consciousness, it tempers, combines and harmonises the psychic and material natures. Under that rule we know in our rational part something of whence we came and whither we are going. The sun genius is not, however, characterised thereby in its fulness, for it is not a simple thing to expound. It is the analogy of solar light, realized in the third part of our human triplicity. It has been called an angel pouring the fluids of life from chalice to chalice. It is also temperance in a rare and high sense."

**English Paraphrase**:
**The Secret of Eternal Life in Incarnation** – A **winged angel** (androgynous: "neither male nor female") bears **the sun sign on forehead** and **the square and triangle of the septenary (7)** on breast – geometric symbols of completion. The angel pours **"the essences of life from chalice to chalice"** – continuous circulation of life-force.

Standing **"one foot upon the earth and one upon the waters"** illustrates **"the nature of the essences"** – the angel mediates between material (earth) and emotional/unconscious (water) realms. A **"direct path goes up to certain heights on the verge of the horizon, and above there is a great light, through the midst of which a crown is seen vaguely"** – the path to spiritual attainment, divine crown barely visible.

Waite's revelation: **"Hereof is some part of the Secret of Eternal Life, as it is possible to man in his incarnation."** Eternal life is achievable **while still embodied**, not only after death. **"All the conventional emblems are renounced herein"** – Waite rejects standard interpretations.

The name "Temperance" is **"almost an impeachment of the truth"** – a misnomer. The card has **"nothing to do with that virtue in any ordinary sense."** Instead: **"When the rule of it obtains in our consciousness, it tempers, combines and harmonises the psychic and material natures."** Under this rule, **"we know in our rational part something of whence we came and whither we are going"** – knowledge of origin and destiny.

The **"sun genius"** is **"not characterised thereby in its fulness, for it is not a simple thing to expound."** It is **"the analogy of solar light, realized in the third part of our human triplicity"** – spirit (after body and soul), solar consciousness achieved.

#### Core Points

- **Secret of Eternal Life**: Part of this secret is achievable in incarnation, while still alive.
- **Tempers and Harmonises**: The card's rule tempers, combines, and harmonises the psychic and material natures.
- **Origin and Destiny**: Under this rule we know in our rational part whence we came and whither we are going.
- **Third Part of Triplicity**: It is the analogy of solar light, realized in the third part of our human triplicity—spirit after body and soul.
- **Misnomer**: The name "Temperance" is almost an impeachment of the truth—it has nothing to do with the ordinary virtue.

#### Detailed Explanation

A winged angel (androgynous) bears the sun sign on forehead and the square and triangle of the septenary on breast. The angel pours the essences of life from chalice to chalice, standing one foot upon earth and one upon waters—illustrating the nature of the essences.

A direct path goes up to certain heights, and above there is a great light through which a crown is seen vaguely. "Hereof is some part of the Secret of Eternal Life, as it is possible to man in his incarnation"—eternal life achievable while embodied.

The name "Temperance" is "almost an impeachment of the truth"—a misnomer. "When the rule of it obtains in our consciousness, it tempers, combines and harmonises the psychic and material natures. Under that rule we know something of whence we came and whither we are going."

**Chinese Explanation**:
**节制（化身中永生秘密）**——一位**有翼天使**（雌雄同体："非男非女"）额头有**太阳符号**，胸前有**七数的方与三角**——完成的几何符号。天使将**"生命精髓从一杯倒入另一杯"**——生命力持续循环。

**"一脚踏地一脚踏水"**说明**"精髓的本质"**——天使调解物质（地）与情感/无意识（水）领域。**"一条直路通向地平线边缘的某些高处，上方有大光，透过其中隐约可见王冠"**——通向灵性成就之路，神圣王冠依稀可见。

韦特的揭示：**"这里是永生秘密的某部分，是人在化身中可能达到的"**。永生在**仍具身体时**可达成，非仅死后。**"所有传统象征在此被抛弃"**——韦特拒绝标准诠释。

"节制"之名**"几乎是对其真理的控诉"**——名不副实。此牌与**"任何普通意义上的那种美德无关"**。相反：**"当它的规则在我们意识中获得时，它调和、结合、和谐心灵与物质本性"**。在此规则下，**"我们在理性部分知道一些关于我们从何而来、往何处去"**——关于起源与命运的知识。

**"太阳天才"****"并非由此完全表征，因为这不是简单的事情来阐述"**。它是**"太阳光的类比，在我们人类三位一体的第三部分实现"**——灵性（在身体和灵魂之后），达成太阳意识。

**In Readings**: Balance, moderation, patience, alchemy, integration, but deeper: eternal life secret (in incarnation), tempering psychic/material, knowledge of origin and destiny, solar consciousness realized.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Waite reveals "some part of the Secret of Eternal Life, as it is possible to man in his incarnation." Name "Temperance" is "fantastical" - it tempers/harmonises psychic and material. "Know whence we came and whither we are going." NOT sun genius but "analogy of solar light, realized in third part of triplicity."
- **中文**: 韦特揭示"永生秘密的某部分，作为人在化身中的可能"。"节制"之名"奇妙"—调和心灵与物质。"知道我们从何而来、往何处去"。不是太阳天才而是"太阳光的类比，在三位一体第三部分实现"。
