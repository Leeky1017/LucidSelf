**Source Text**:
> "A woman, over whose head there broods the same symbol of life which we have seen in the card of the Magician, is closing the jaws of a lion. The only point in which this design differs from the conventional presentations is that her beneficent fortitude has already subdued the lion, which is being led by a chain of flowers. For reasons which satisfy myself, this card has been interchanged with that of justice, which is usually numbered eight. As the variation carries nothing with it which will signify to the reader, there is no cause for explanation. Fortitude, in one of its most exalted aspects, is connected with the Divine Mystery of Union; the virtue, of course, operates in all planes, and hence draws on all in its symbolism. It connects also with innocentia inviolata, and with the strength which resides in contemplation.

> These higher meanings are, however, matters of inference, and I do not suggest that they are transparent on the surface of the card. They are intimated in a concealed manner by the chain of flowers, which signifies, among many other things, the sweet yoke and the light burden of Divine Law, when it has been taken into the heart of hearts. The card has nothing to do with self-confidence in the ordinary sense, though this has been suggested--but it concerns the confidence of those whose strength is God, who have found their refuge in Him. There is one aspect in which the lion signifies the passions, and she who is called Strength is the higher nature in its liberation. It has walked upon the asp and the basilisk and has trodden down the lion and the dragon."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Spiritual Fortitude and the Sweet Yoke** – A woman with the **infinity symbol (∞) above her head** (same as the Magician – eternal spiritual life) is **closing the jaws of a lion**. Waite's key innovation: **"her beneficent fortitude has already subdued the lion, which is being led by a chain of flowers"** – not struggle but accomplished mastery through gentleness.

Waite interchanged this card with Justice (traditionally VIII), making Strength VIII and Justice XI. He states: **"For reasons which satisfy myself... there is no cause for explanation"** (private esoteric reasoning).

The deeper meaning: **"Fortitude, in one of its most exalted aspects, is connected with the Divine Mystery of Union"** – this is not mere physical or moral courage but spiritual strength arising from union with the Divine. It **"operates in all planes"** (physical, emotional, mental, spiritual) and connects with **innocentia inviolata** (inviolate innocence) and **"the strength which resides in contemplation"** – meditative/mystical power.

The **chain of flowers** is crucial symbolism, representing **"the sweet yoke and the light burden of Divine Law, when it has been taken into the heart of hearts"** (echoing Matthew 11:30: "my yoke is easy, my burden is light"). This is voluntary submission to divine will, which paradoxically grants true freedom and strength.

Waite clarifies: This card **"has nothing to do with self-confidence in the ordinary sense"** but **"concerns the confidence of those whose strength is God, who have found their refuge in Him."** The lion signifies **passions**, and the woman is **"the higher nature in its liberation."** Biblical reference (Psalm 91:13): **"It has walked upon the asp and the basilisk and has trodden down the lion and the dragon"** – triumph over all lower forces through spiritual power.

#### Core Points

- **Divine Mystery of Union**: Fortitude in its most exalted aspects is connected with the Divine Mystery of Union.
- **Sweet Yoke**: The chain of flowers signifies the sweet yoke and light burden of Divine Law, taken into the heart of hearts.
- **Strength is God**: The card concerns the confidence of those whose strength is God, who have found their refuge in Him.
- **Higher Nature**: The lion signifies passions; she who is called Strength is the higher nature in its liberation.
- **Innocentia Inviolata**: Connected with inviolate innocence and the strength which resides in contemplation.

#### Detailed Explanation

A woman with the infinity symbol above her head (same as the Magician) is closing the jaws of a lion. Waite's key innovation: "her beneficent fortitude has already subdued the lion, which is being led by a chain of flowers"—not struggle but accomplished mastery through gentleness.

The deeper meaning: "Fortitude, in one of its most exalted aspects, is connected with the Divine Mystery of Union"—not mere physical or moral courage but spiritual strength arising from union with the Divine. It "operates in all planes" and connects with innocentia inviolata and "the strength which resides in contemplation."

The chain of flowers represents "the sweet yoke and the light burden of Divine Law, when it has been taken into the heart of hearts" (echoing Matthew 11:30). This card "has nothing to do with self-confidence in the ordinary sense" but "concerns the confidence of those whose strength is God."

**Chinese Explanation**:
**力量/坚毅（灵性坚毅与甜蜜轭）**——一位头顶**无穷大符号（∞）**（与魔术师相同——永恒灵性生命）的女性正**合上狮子的颌**。韦特的关键创新：**"她的仁慈坚毅已经制服了狮子，狮子被花链牵引"**——非挣扎而是通过温柔完成的掌握。

韦特将此牌与正义（传统VIII）互换，使力量为VIII、正义为XI。他说：**"出于令我满意的理由......无需解释"**（私人内隐推理）。

更深含义：**"坚毅在其最崇高面向之一，与神圣结合奥秘相连"**——这不是单纯的身体或道德勇气，而是源于与神圣结合的灵性力量。它**"在所有层面运作"**（物质、情感、心智、灵性），与**innocentia inviolata**（不可侵犯的天真）和**"驻于沉思中的力量"**——冥想/神秘力量相连。

**花链**是关键象征，代表**"神圣法则的甜蜜轭与轻省负担，当它被带入内心深处时"**（呼应马太11:30："我的轭是容易的，我的担子是轻省的"）。这是对神圣意志的自愿臣服，悖论性地授予真正自由与力量。

韦特澄清：此牌**"与一般意义上的自信无关"**，而是**"关于那些力量源于神、在祂里面找到庇护的人的信心"**。狮子象征**激情**，女性是**"解放中的更高本性"**。圣经引用（诗篇91:13）：**"它践踏毒蛇与蛇怪，踏下狮子与飞龙"**——通过灵性力量战胜所有较低力量。

**In Readings**: Inner strength, courage, patience, compassion, gentle control, spiritual power, but reminder: true strength comes from divine connection, not ego-will.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Waite interchanged this card with Justice "for reasons which satisfy myself." Strength connected with "Divine Mystery of Union" and innocentia inviolata. Chain of flowers is "sweet yoke and light burden of Divine Law." Not self-confidence but "confidence of those whose strength is God."
- **中文**: 韦特将此牌与正义互换"出于令我满意的理由"。力量与"神圣结合奥秘"和innocentia inviolata相连。花链是"神圣法则的甘蜕轭与轻省负担"。不是自信而是"力量源于神的人的信心"。
