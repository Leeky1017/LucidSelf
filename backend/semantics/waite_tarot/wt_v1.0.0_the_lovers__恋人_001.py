**Source Text**:
> "The sun shines in the zenith, and beneath is a great winged figure with arms extended, pouring down influences. In the foreground are two human figures, male and female, unveiled before each other, as if Adam and Eve when they first occupied the paradise of the earthly body. Behind the man is the Tree of Life, bearing twelve fruits, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is behind the woman; the serpent is twining round it. The figures suggest youth, virginity, innocence and love before it is contaminated by gross material desire. This is in all simplicity the card of human love, here exhibited as part of the way, the truth and the life. It replaces, by recourse to first principles, the old card of marriage, which I have described previously, and the later follies which depicted man between vice and virtue. In a very high sense, the card is a mystery of the Covenant and Sabbath.

> The suggestion in respect of the woman is that she signifies that attraction towards the sensitive life which carries within it the idea of the Fall of Man, but she is rather the working of a Secret Law of Providence than a willing and conscious temptress. It is through her imputed lapse that man shall arise ultimately, and only by her can he complete himself. The card is therefore in its way another intimation concerning the great mystery of womanhood."

**English Paraphrase**:
**Sacred Union and the Mystery of Love** – Waite radically redesigns this card, rejecting the older "man between vice and virtue" moralizing. Instead, he returns to **"first principles"**: Adam and Eve in paradise, **unveiled before each other** in original innocence – **"youth, virginity, innocence and love before it is contaminated by gross material desire."**

Above them shines **the sun in the zenith** and a **great winged figure with arms extended, pouring down influences** (angelic blessing, divine sanction). Behind the man: **Tree of Life bearing twelve fruits** (spiritual perfection, zodiacal wholeness). Behind the woman: **Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil with serpent twining** (conscious choice, the potential for fall).

Waite's profound reinterpretation: This is **"in all simplicity the card of human love, here exhibited as part of the way, the truth and the life"** – love as sacred path, not moral test. It is **"a mystery of the Covenant and Sabbath"** in its highest sense – union as divine sacrament.

The woman's role: She is **"that attraction towards the sensitive life which carries within it the idea of the Fall of Man,"** but Waite insists she is **"rather the working of a Secret Law of Providence than a willing and conscious temptress."** She is not Eve-the-seductress but Eve-as-necessity: **"It is through her imputed lapse that man shall arise ultimately, and only by her can he complete himself."**

This paradox – the Fall as fortunate, the descent enabling ascent – makes The Lovers **"another intimation concerning the great mystery of womanhood."** Woman is not obstacle but pathway; the "fall" into incarnation is the condition for redemption.

#### Core Points

- **Sacred Love as Path**: This is the card of human love exhibited as part of the way, the truth, and the life.
- **Original Innocence**: Youth, virginity, innocence and love before contamination by gross material desire.
- **Secret Law of Providence**: The woman is not a conscious temptress but the working of divine necessity.
- **Fortunate Fall**: Through her imputed lapse man shall arise ultimately; only by her can he complete himself.
- **Mystery of Womanhood**: The card is another intimation concerning the great mystery of womanhood.

#### Detailed Explanation

Waite radically redesigns this card, rejecting the older "man between vice and virtue" moralizing. Instead, he returns to "first principles": Adam and Eve in paradise, unveiled before each other in original innocence—"youth, virginity, innocence and love before it is contaminated by gross material desire."

Above them shines the sun in the zenith and a great winged figure with arms extended, pouring down influences (angelic blessing, divine sanction). Behind the man: Tree of Life bearing twelve fruits (spiritual perfection). Behind the woman: Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil with serpent twining (conscious choice, potential for fall).

Waite's profound reinterpretation: This is "in all simplicity the card of human love, here exhibited as part of the way, the truth and the life"—love as sacred path, not moral test. The woman's role: She is "that attraction towards the sensitive life which carries within it the idea of the Fall of Man," but she is "rather the working of a Secret Law of Providence than a willing and conscious temptress." Through her "imputed lapse" man shall arise ultimately, and only by her can he complete himself.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**恋人（神圣结合与爱的奥秘）**——韦特彻底重新设计此牌，拒绝旧版"美德与邪恶之间的男人"道德说教。相反，他回归**"第一原则"**：伊甸园中的亚当与夏娃，**"彼此揭开面纱"**处于原初天真——**"青春、童贞、天真与爱，在被粗鄙物质欲望污染之前"**。

他们上方，**天顶太阳闪耀**，一位**伟大的展翅形象张开双臂，倾注影响力**（天使祝福、神圣认可）。男人身后：**生命之树结十二果实**（灵性完美、黄道整体性）。女人身后：**善恶知识树缠绕着蛇**（有意识选择、堕落的可能性）。

韦特的深刻重新诠释：这是**"以最朴素的方式呈现人类之爱的牌，在此展示为道路、真理与生命的一部分"**——爱作为神圣路径，而非道德测试。它在最高意义上是**"圣约与安息日的奥秘"**——结合作为神圣圣礼。

女性的角色：她是**"对感性生活的吸引，其中携带人类堕落的理念"**，但韦特坚持她**"更多是天意秘密法则的运作，而非有意识的诱惑者"**。她不是诱惑者夏娃，而是必然性夏娃：**"正是通过她被归咎的过失，人类将最终上升，只有通过她，他才能完整自己"**。

这一悖论——堕落是幸运的，下降使上升成为可能——使恋人成为**"关于女性伟大奥秘的又一暗示"**。女性不是障碍而是路径；"堕落"进入化身是救赎的条件。

**In Readings**: Love, relationships, choice, union, harmony, but also need for conscious choice between higher/lower paths, spiritual vs material love.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Waite redesigns card from "man between vice and virtue" to Adam/Eve in original innocence. Woman is "Secret Law of Providence, not conscious temptress." Through her "imputed lapse" man arises. The Lovers as "mystery of Covenant and Sabbath."
- **中文**: 韦特重新设计此牌，从"美德与邪恶间的男人"改为原初天真中的亚当/夏娃。女性是"天意秘密法则，非有意识诱惑者"。通过她"被归哎的过失"人类上升。恋人作为"圣约与安息日的奥秘"。
