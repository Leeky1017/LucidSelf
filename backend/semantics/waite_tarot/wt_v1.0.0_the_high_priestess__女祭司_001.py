**Source Text**:
> "She has the lunar crescent at her feet, a horned diadem on her head, with a globe in the middle place, and a large solar cross on her breast. The scroll in her hands is inscribed with the word Tora, signifying the Greater Law, the Secret Law and the second sense of the Word. It is partly covered by her mantle, to shew that some things are implied and some spoken. She is seated between the white and black pillars--J. and B.--of the mystic Temple, and the veil of the Temple is behind her: it is embroidered with palms and pomegranates. The vestments are flowing and gauzy, and the mantle suggests light--a shimmering radiance. She has been called occult Science on the threshold of the Sanctuary of Isis, but she is really the Secret Church, the House which is of God and man. She represents also the Second Marriage of the Prince who is no longer of this world; she is the spiritual Bride and Mother, the daughter of the stars and the Higher Garden of Eden. She is, in fine, the Queen of the borrowed light, but this is the light of all. She is the Moon nourished by the milk of the Supernal Mother.

> In a manner, she is also the Supernal Mother herself--that is to say, she is the bright reflection. It is in this sense of reflection that her truest and highest name in symbolism is **Shekinah**--the co-habiting glory. According to Kabalism, there is a Shekinah both above and below. In the superior world it is called Binah, the Supernal Understanding which reflects to the emanations that are beneath. In the lower world it is Malkuth--that world being, for this purpose, understood as a blessed Kingdom that with which it is made blessed being the Indwelling Glory. Mystically speaking, the Shekinah is the Spiritual Bride of the just man, and when he reads the Law she gives the Divine meaning. **There are some respects in which this card is the highest and holiest of the Greater Arcana.**"

**English Paraphrase**:
**Shekinah: The Secret Church and Divine Presence** – Waite presents The High Priestess as one of the **most sacred** cards in the Tarot, embodying the **Shekinah** – the Divine Presence or "co-habiting glory" in Qabalistic tradition. She sits enthroned between the **pillars Jachin and Boaz** (J. and B.), the white and black columns of Solomon's Temple, representing the duality of manifestation (light/dark, mercy/severity, manifest/hidden). Behind her hangs the **veil of the Temple**, embroidered with palms (victory) and pomegranates (fertility, hidden seeds), concealing the Holy of Holies.

Her iconography is dense with sacred symbolism: the **lunar crescent at her feet** establishes her as Queen of the borrowed (reflected) light, the Moon nourished by the Supernal Mother (Binah). The **horned diadem** (crescent moon) on her head with a globe (full moon) signifies her dominion over the lunar realm of intuition, dreams, and the subconscious. The **solar cross on her breast** shows she mediates both solar (active/conscious) and lunar (receptive/subconscious) forces.

Most significantly, she holds the **scroll inscribed "TORA"** (not Torah but TORA, suggesting both Law and Tarot itself) – the **Greater Law, the Secret Law, and the second sense of the Word**. This scroll is **partly covered by her mantle**, teaching that "some things are implied and some spoken" – the essential doctrine that sacred knowledge has exoteric (public) and esoteric (hidden) dimensions. She is the guardian of mysteries, revealing only to initiates.

Waite's highest identification: She is the **Shekinah**, the Divine Presence dwelling with humanity. In Qabalah, Shekinah exists in two forms: above (Binah, Supernal Understanding reflecting downward) and below (Malkuth, the Kingdom made blessed by Indwelling Glory). As Shekinah, she is the **Spiritual Bride of the just man** – when he studies sacred texts, she reveals the divine meaning hidden within. She is not mere occult science but the **Secret Church**, the mystical body of God and man, the **Second Marriage** (spiritual union beyond worldly marriage), and the **Higher Garden of Eden** (spiritual paradise vs. earthly Eden).

Waite declares: "**There are some respects in which this card is the highest and holiest of the Greater Arcana**" – extraordinary praise suggesting she embodies the very essence of the Secret Tradition itself.

#### Core Points

- **Shekinah Presence**: The High Priestess embodies Shekinah—the Divine Presence or "co-habiting glory" dwelling with humanity.
- **Highest and Holiest**: Waite declares this "the highest and holiest of the Greater Arcana" in some respects.
- **Secret Law**: The TORA scroll represents the Greater Law, the Secret Law, and the second sense of the Word.
- **Implied vs Spoken**: The partly covered scroll teaches that sacred knowledge has exoteric and esoteric dimensions.
- **Spiritual Bride**: As Shekinah, she reveals divine meaning to the just man who studies sacred texts.

#### Detailed Explanation

Waite presents The High Priestess as one of the most sacred cards in the Tarot, embodying the Shekinah—the Divine Presence in Qabalistic tradition. She sits enthroned between the pillars Jachin and Boaz (J. and B.), the white and black columns of Solomon's Temple representing the duality of manifestation. Behind her hangs the veil of the Temple, embroidered with palms (victory) and pomegranates (fertility, hidden seeds), concealing the Holy of Holies.

Her iconography is dense with sacred symbolism: the lunar crescent at her feet establishes her as Queen of reflected light; the horned diadem with globe signifies dominion over intuition, dreams, and the subconscious; the solar cross on her breast shows she mediates both solar (conscious) and lunar (subconscious) forces.

Most significantly, she holds the scroll inscribed "TORA"—the Greater Law, the Secret Law, and the second sense of the Word. This scroll is partly covered by her mantle, teaching that "some things are implied and some spoken." In Qabalah, Shekinah exists in two forms: above (Binah) and below (Malkuth). As the Spiritual Bride of the just man, she reveals the divine meaning hidden within sacred texts.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**女祭司（希金娜：秘密教会与神圣临在）**是韦特认为**最神圣**的塔罗牌之一，体现**希金娜**（Shekinah）——卡巴拉传统中的神圣临在或"共居荣光"。她端坐在所罗门圣殿的**雅斤与波阿斯柱**（J.和B.）之间，白色与黑色立柱代表显化的二元性（光明/黑暗、慈悲/严厉、显现/隐藏）。她身后悬挂**圣殿幔幕**，上面绣着棕榈（胜利）与石榴（生育、隐藏种子），遮蔽着至圣所。

她的图像密集着神圣象征：**脚下的新月**确立她为借来的（反射）光之女王，被至高母神（Binah）滋养的月亮。头戴**角状冠冕**（新月）中央有球体（满月），象征她统治月亮领域——直觉、梦境、潜意识。**胸前的太阳十字**显示她调和太阳（主动/意识）与月亮（接受/潜意识）力量。

最重要的是，她手持铭刻**"TORA"的卷轴**（非Torah而是TORA，暗示法则与塔罗本身）——**大律法、秘密律法、道的第二层意义**。这卷轴**被她的斗篷部分遮盖**，教导"有些话隐含，有些话说出"——神圣知识有外显（公开）与内隐（秘密）维度的本质教义。她是奥秘守护者，只向启蒙者揭示。

韦特的最高认定：她是**希金娜**，与人类同在的神圣临在。在卡巴拉中，希金娜存在两种形式：上（Binah，至高理解向下反射）与下（Malkuth，被内住荣光祝福的王国）。作为希金娜，她是**义人的灵性新娘**——当他研习圣典时，她揭示其中隐藏的神圣含义。她不仅是神秘科学，更是**秘密教会**，神与人的神秘之体，**第二次婚姻**（超越世俗婚姻的灵性结合），以及**更高的伊甸园**（灵性天堂vs世俗伊甸）。

韦特宣称："**在某些方面，此牌是大阿卡纳中最高最圣的**"——非凡赞誉，暗示她体现秘密传统的本质。

**In Readings**: Hidden knowledge, intuition, secrets, subconscious wisdom, sacred feminine, but also warning against surface understanding – deeper meaning requires initiation.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Waite declares this "highest and holiest of Greater Arcana." Shekinah as Divine Presence (Binah above, Malkuth below). TORA scroll partly covered - exoteric/esoteric distinction. Spiritual Bride reveals divine meaning to the just man.
- **中文**: 韦特宣称此牌"大阿卡纳中最高最圣"。希金娜作为神圣临在（上Binah，下Malkuth）。TORA卷轴部分遮盖—外显/内隐区分。灵性新娘向义人揭示神圣含义。
