**Source Text**:
> "Occult explanations attached to this card are meagre and mostly disconcerting. It is said further that it contains the first allusion to a material building, but I do not conceive that the Tower is more or less material than the pillars which we have met with in three previous cases. I see nothing to warrant Papus in supposing that it is literally the fall of Adam, but there is more in favour of his alternative--that it signifies the materialization of the spiritual word. The bibliographer Christian imagines that it is the downfall of the mind, seeking to penetrate the mystery of God. I agree rather with Grand Orient that it is the ruin of the House of We, when evil has prevailed therein, and above all that it is the rending of a House of Doctrine. I understand that the reference is, however, to a House of Falsehood. It illustrates also in the most comprehensive way the old truth that 'except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.'

> There is a sense in which the catastrophe is a reflection from the previous card, but not on the side of the symbolism which I have tried to indicate therein. It is more correctly a question of analogy; one is concerned with the fall into the material and animal state, while the other signifies destruction on the intellectual side. The Tower has been spoken of as the chastisement of pride and the intellect overwhelmed in the attempt to penetrate the Mystery of God; but in neither case do these explanations account for the two persons who are the living sufferers. The one is the literal word made void and the other its false interpretation. In yet a deeper sense, it may signify also the end of a dispensation, but there is no possibility here for the consideration of this involved question."

**English Paraphrase**:
**House of Falsehood Destroyed** – Waite dismisses most interpretations as inadequate. He rejects Papus's literal "fall of Adam" but accepts the alternative: **"materialization of the spiritual word"** – when divine truth becomes corrupted into rigid materialism.

Waite agrees with Grand Orient: it is **"the ruin of the House of We, when evil has prevailed therein"** and especially **"the rending of a House of Doctrine."** Critically, he specifies: **"I understand that the reference is, however, to a House of Falsehood"** – false doctrine, not true teaching.

Biblical foundation: **"'except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it'"** (Psalm 127:1) – human edifices built without divine foundation must fall.

Tower vs Devil analogy: **"one is concerned with the fall into the material and animal state"** (Devil = material bondage), **"while the other signifies destruction on the intellectual side"** (Tower = intellectual/doctrinal collapse).

The **two falling figures**: **"The one is the literal word made void and the other its false interpretation"** – both literalism and false exegesis are destroyed. Tower demolishes corrupt religious/intellectual structures.

#### Core Points

- **House of Falsehood**: The Tower is a House of Falsehood—false doctrine that must be destroyed.
- **Materialized Spiritual Word**: It signifies the materialization of the spiritual word—divine truth corrupted into rigid materialism.
- **Except Lord Build House**: "Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it" (Psalm 127:1).
- **Two Falling Figures**: One is the literal word made void, the other its false interpretation—both destroyed.
- **Devil vs Tower**: Devil = fall into material/animal state; Tower = destruction on the intellectual side.

#### Detailed Explanation

Waite dismisses most interpretations as inadequate. He rejects Papus's literal "fall of Adam" but accepts: "materialization of the spiritual word"—when divine truth becomes corrupted into rigid materialism.

Waite agrees with Grand Orient: it is "the ruin of the House of We, when evil has prevailed therein" and especially "the rending of a House of Doctrine." Critically: "I understand that the reference is, however, to a House of Falsehood"—false doctrine, not true teaching.

The two falling figures: "The one is the literal word made void and the other its false interpretation"—both literalism and false exegesis are destroyed. Tower demolishes corrupt religious/intellectual structures.

**Chinese Explanation**:
**塔（虚假教义之屋被毁）**——韦特驳斥大多数诠释为不充分。他拒绝Papus的字面"亚当堕落"，但接受替代方案：**"灵性话语的物质化"**——当神圣真理被腐化为僵化物质主义。

韦特同意大东方会：这是**"我们之屋的毁灭，当恶在其中盛行"**，尤其是**"教义之屋的撕裂"**。关键是，他明确：**"然而我理解，所指是虚假之屋"**——虚假教义，非真实教导。

圣经基础：**"'若非耶和华建造房屋，建造的人就枉然劳力'"**（诗篇127:1）——没有神圣基础的人类建筑必然倒塌。

塔vs魔鬼类比：**"一个涉及堕入物质与动物状态"**（魔鬼=物质束缚），**"另一个象征智识侧的毁灭"**（塔=智识/教义崩溃）。

**两个坠落人物**：**"一个是字面话语成为虚空，另一个是其虚假诠释"**——字面主义与虚假解经都被毁灭。塔摧毁腐败的宗教/智识结构。

**In Readings**: Sudden upheaval, collapse of false beliefs, destruction of illusions, but remember: only false structures fall (House of Falsehood), necessary clearing for truth.

#### Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)

- **English**: Waite agrees with Grand Orient: "ruin of House of We, rending of House of Doctrine." Specifies: "House of Falsehood." Two figures: "literal word made void" + "false interpretation." Devil=material fall, Tower=intellectual destruction.
- **中文**: 韦特同意大东方会："我们之屋毁灭，教义之屋撕裂"。明确："虚假之屋"。两人："字面话语成虚空"+"虚假诠释"。魔鬼=物质堕落，塔=智识毁灭。
