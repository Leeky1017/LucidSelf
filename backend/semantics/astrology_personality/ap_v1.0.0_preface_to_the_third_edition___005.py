> In closing may I stress the fact that in this book the word "personality" has not the negative or lower-level meaning that esotericists and New Thought people usually attach to it. I am using it as the philosopher Ian Smuts and the psychologist Carl Jung use it. Perhaps the following few sentences, which were included in the Prefaces of the first and second edition of this book, will make this point clear.

> "Personality, in the largest sense, is the organic whole in which the physiological and the psycho-mental natures of man are progressively integrated. Therefore it represents the wholeness of the human being as a microcosm; man as a whole solar system operating on the background of, and in constant relationship to the zodiac or the galaxy. Astrology ... is an art of life-interpretation and it provides us with a technique for the development and fulfillment of 'personality.' Its aim is to transform chaotic human nature into a microcosm. When man becomes truly a microcosm, he demonstrates personality to the fullest extent and manifests as a living Person, or as a great Personage ... The goal of astrology is the alchemy of personality. It is to transform chaos into cosmos, collective human nature into individual and creative personality."

**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Personality (Smuts/Jung sense)**: `organic whole` / `integrated being` / `not lower ego`
- **Microcosm**: `whole solar system in miniature` / `cosmic reflection` / `human as universe`
- **Alchemy of personality**: `chaos to cosmos transformation` / `integration goal` / `Rudhyar's phrase`
- **Physiological + psycho-mental integration**: `body-mind unity` / `holistic person` / `progressive development`
- **Living Person/Personage**: `fully integrated being` / `personality fulfillment` / `actualization complete`

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Rudhyar concludes the Third Edition Preface by clarifying his use of "personality"—a term often disparaged in esoteric circles as the "lower self." Following Smuts and Jung, Rudhyar defines personality as the organic whole integrating physical and psycho-mental aspects of the human being. In this highest sense, personality represents the human as microcosm—a complete solar system in miniature, operating in relationship to the cosmic whole (zodiac/galaxy).

Astrology's goal becomes "the alchemy of personality": transforming the chaos of undifferentiated human nature into the cosmos of an integrated, creative individual. This is not ego-inflation but genuine individuation—becoming a "living Person" or "great Personage" who embodies cosmic order at the human scale. The phrase "alchemy of personality" captures Rudhyar's vision: astrology as a transformative discipline, not mere description or prediction.

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
Rudhyar在第三版前言结尾处澄清了他对"人格"一词的使用——这个术语在神秘学圈子中常被贬低为"低我"。遵循Smuts和Jung，Rudhyar将人格定义为整合人类身体和心理-精神层面的有机整体。在这个最高意义上，人格代表人作为微观宇宙——一个完整的微型太阳系，在与宇宙整体（黄道/银河）的关系中运作。

占星学的目标成为"人格的炼金术"：将未分化的人性混沌转化为整合的、创造性个体的宇宙秩序。这不是小我膨胀而是真正的个体化——成为体现宇宙秩序的"活的人格"或"伟大人物"。"人格的炼金术"这个短语捕捉了Rudhyar的愿景：占星学作为转化的学科，而非仅仅是描述或预测。

**Core Points**:
- "Personality" used in Smuts/Jung sense, not esoteric "lower self"
- Personality = organic whole integrating body and psyche
- Human as microcosm = complete solar system in miniature
- Astrology is "art of life-interpretation"
- Goal: development and fulfillment of personality
- "Alchemy of personality" = chaos to cosmos transformation
- Fully integrated person = "living Person" or "Personage"
- Collective human nature → individual creative personality

**Detailed Explanation**:
This definition encapsulates Rudhyar's entire project. By reclaiming "personality" from esoteric denigration, he affirms the value of individual existence while connecting it to cosmic order. The microcosm concept is ancient (Hermetic "as above, so below"), but Rudhyar modernizes it through psychological language. The "alchemy of personality" echoes Jung's individuation process—the lifelong work of integrating unconscious contents into conscious wholeness.

The phrase "transform chaos into cosmos" reveals astrology's highest purpose: not predicting when chaos will strike, but guiding the person toward order and integration. This is why Rudhyar insists on the tropical zodiac and person-centered approach—they support the transformative, meaning-making function rather than mere event-correlation.

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: This definition appeared in all editions (1936, 1970). Rudhyar's "alchemy of personality" became a defining phrase for his approach, distinguishing it from both traditional predictive and purely psychological astrology.
- **中文**: 此定义出现在所有版本（1936、1970）。Rudhyar的"人格炼金术"成为其方法的标志性短语，使其与传统预测占星和纯心理占星都有所区别。"""
