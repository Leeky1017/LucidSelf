**Key Term Analysis**:
- **Greek intellectualism**: `mind → analytical intellect` / `wisdom → sophistry` / `unbalanced individualism`
- **Psychological chaos**: `after 6th century failure` / `physiological disequilibrium` / `sensuality, perversion`
- **Astrology's degeneration**: `ceased vital for collectivities` / `catering to individuals' fears` / `fortune-telling`
- **Greek logic**: `killed physiological astrology` / `abstract order-making` / `projecting order outwardly`
- **Ideological revolution**: `ideas as independent world` / `escape from biological fear` / `making world from ideas`
- **Alchemy rebirth**: `deeper astrology` / `hidden from surface` / `psychological agriculture`

**English Paraphrase (Primary Language)**:
Rudhyar traces astrology's historical degeneration. The sixth century transformation failed: even the elite couldn't live up to the Great Teachers' vision. In Greece, mind devolved into mere analytical intellect, wisdom into sophistry. Unbalanced individualism led to large-scale psychological chaos.

Astrology transformed fundamentally: it ceased being vital for collectivities because rational intellect allowed humans to project their own abstract order. As individuals became central, astrology catered to their fears—becoming fortune-telling on the surface while deeper astrology was reborn as alchemy.

The crucial insight: "Greek logic killed the meaning of physiological astrology." If humans could create order abstractly (through ideas), why painfully search for it in nature? This was an "incredible revolution"—ideas became a self-sufficient world where humans could escape biological fear. Before, ideas connected phenomena; now they lived independently.

This explains astrology's split: surface degeneration into fortune-telling (satisfying individual fears) while depth survived as alchemy (psychological self-cultivation).

**Complete Chinese Interpretation (Secondary Language)**:
Rudhyar追溯了占星学的历史堕落。6世纪的转变失败了：即使精英也无法达到伟大导师的愿景。在希腊，心智退化为仅仅分析性智力，智慧变成诡辩。不平衡的个人主义导致大规模心理混乱。

占星学根本性地转变了：它不再对集体至关重要，因为理性智力使人类能够投射自己的抽象秩序。当个人成为中心时，占星学迎合他们的恐惧——表面上成为算命，而更深层的占星学作为炼金术重生。

关键洞见："希腊逻辑杀死了生理占星学的意义。"如果人类可以抽象地（通过观念）创造秩序，为什么要痛苦地在自然中寻找它？这是一场"难以置信的革命"——观念成为一个自足的世界，人类可以在其中逃避生理恐惧。以前，观念连接现象；现在它们独立存在。

这解释了占星学的分裂：表面堕落为算命（满足个人恐惧），而深度作为炼金术（心理自我修养）存活。

**Core Points**:
- 6th century transformation failed even among elite
- Greece: mind → mere intellect, wisdom → sophistry
- Unbalanced individualism → psychological chaos
- Astrology ceased vital for collectivities
- Rational intellect enabled abstract order-projection
- Astrology catered to individual fears → fortune-telling
- Deeper astrology reborn as alchemy
- Greek logic killed physiological astrology
- Ideas became independent world (ideological revolution)
- Split: surface fortune-telling vs depth alchemy

**Textual Criticism & Variant Analysis (Bilingual)**:
- **English**: Rudhyar's critique of Greek intellectualism echoes Nietzsche and anticipates later critiques of Western rationalism. The fortune-telling critique remains central to humanistic astrology's self-definition.
- **中文**: Rudhyar对希腊知性主义的批评呼应尼采，并预见了后来对西方理性主义的批评。对算命的批评仍是人本占星学自我定义的核心。"""
