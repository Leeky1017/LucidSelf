#### Source Text

"Purging dreams are your mind and spirit processing and releasing emotional or spiritual baggage. Like taking out garbage—therapeutic function, not revelation. Common after intense experiences. May be disturbing but serve cathartic purpose."

#### English Paraphrase

**Purging Dream** = **emotional/spiritual detox**, not prophetic message. Brain/spirit **processing trauma, stress, unresolved issues**—release mechanism, not divine communication requiring interpretation.

**Characteristics**:
- Disturbing, chaotic, repetitive themes
- Often after intense emotional experiences (loss, conflict, major change)
- Rehashing past events, working through feelings
- May include anxiety, fear, unresolved anger

**Purpose**: **Catharsis**—cleansing system, not message delivery. Like physical body purging toxins.

**How to Recognize**:
- Lacks spiritual coherence or prophetic sense
- Feels like emotional vomit, not organized revelation
- Repetitive without new insight
- Spirit doesn't witness "interpret this"

**What to Do**: **Recognize and release**—don't over-interpret. Thank God for emotional healing process, let it go.

**Not Meaningless** (vs Garbage Dream):
Still valuable—God created emotional processing system. But **release not revelation**. Therapeutic, not prophetic.

#### Chinese Explanation

**清理梦**=**情感/灵性排毒**、非先知信息。大脑/灵**处理创伤、压力、未解决问题**——释放机制、非需诠释神圣沟通。

**特征**：扰乱、混乱、重复主题；强烈情感经历后常见(丧失、冲突、重大改变)；反复过去事件、处理感觉；可包括焦虑、恐惧、未解决愤怒

**目的**：**宣泄**——洁净系统、非信息传递。如身体清除毒素。

**如何识别**：缺灵性连贯或先知感；感觉像情感呕吐非有组织启示；重复无新洞察；灵不见证"诠释这个"

**如何处理**：**识别并释放**——勿过度诠释。感谢神情感疗愈过程、放手。

**非无意义**(vs垃圾梦)：仍有价值——神创造情感处理系统。但**释放非启示**。治疗性非先知性。

#### Core Points

- **Emotional/Spiritual Detox**: Purging dreams process and release emotional baggage, not prophetic.
- **Cathartic Release**: Therapeutic function like body purging toxins.
- **Recognize and Release**: Don't over-interpret; thank God for healing process.
- **Characteristics**: Disturbing, chaotic, repetitive themes after intense experiences.
- **Not Meaningless**: Still valuable (God's healing system) but release not revelation.

#### Detailed Explanation
