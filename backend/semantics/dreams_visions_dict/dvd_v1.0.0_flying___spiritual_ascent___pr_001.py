#### Source Text

"Flying symbolizes spiritual ascent, entering heavenly realms, and prophetic vision. Rising above earthly perspective into spiritual view. Can indicate intercessory prayer (soaring in Spirit) or prophetic revelation. Paul's 'third heaven' (2 Cor 12:2)."

#### English Paraphrase

**Flying** = **spiritual ascent, heavenly realms access, prophetic vision**—transcending earthly to see from God's perspective.

**Biblical Foundation**:
- **Third Heaven**: 2 Cor 12:2-4 (Paul caught up to paradise, heard inexpressible things)
- **Eagle's Wings**: Isaiah 40:31 (those who hope in Lord soar on wings like eagles)
- **Spirit Transportation**: Ezekiel 3:12-14 (Spirit lifted Ezekiel up), Acts 8:39 (Spirit caught Philip away)

**Symbol Meanings**:
- **Soaring/Rising**: Entering heavenly perspective, intercessory prayer altitude, prophetic vision
- **Freedom in Flight**: Liberation from earthly constraints, moving in Spirit's freedom
- **Difficulty Flying**: Struggling in prayer/intercession, spiritual resistance, lack of faith
- **Height of Flight**: Level of spiritual authority/revelation accessed

**Intercessory Connection**:
Flying often indicates **intercessory prayer** (eagle vision)—seeing from God's perspective to pray His will.

**Comparison**:
- **Jung**: Flying = transcendence, freedom from constraints, psychological liberation
- **Toach**: Flying = prophetic vision, intercession altitude, heavenly realm access (spiritual not just psychological)

#### Complete Chinese Interpretation

**飞行**=**灵性上升、天界通达、先知异象**——超越地上从神视角看。

**圣经基础**：三层天(林后12:2-4,保罗被提到乐园、听见不可说话语)；鹰翅(赛40:31,仰望耶和华如鹰展翅上腾)；灵迁移(结3:12-14,灵举起以西结；徒8:39,灵把腓利提去)

**符号含义**：翱翔/上升(进入天上视角、代祷高度、先知异象)；飞行自由(从地上约束解放、在灵自由中行)；飞行困难(祷告/代祷挣扎、灵性阻力、缺信心)；飞行高度(获取灵性权柄/启示层次)

**代祷连接**：飞行常指**代祷**(鹰眼)——从神视角看以祷告祂旨意。

**对比**：Jung(飞行=超越、从约束自由、心理解放)；Toach(飞行=先知异象、代祷高度、天界通达-灵性非仅心理)

#### Core Points

- **Spiritual Ascent**: Flying = entering heavenly realms, prophetic vision, God's perspective.
- **Biblical Foundation**: Third Heaven (2 Cor 12), eagle's wings (Isa 40:31), Spirit transportation (Ezekiel, Philip).
- **Intercessory Connection**: Often indicates intercessory prayer altitude (eagle vision).
- **Flight Quality**: Height = spiritual authority; difficulty = resistance/lack of faith.
- **vs Jung**: Psychological transcendence vs spiritual heavenly realms.

#### Detailed Explanation

Flying symbolizes spiritual ascent, entering heavenly realms, and prophetic vision—transcending earthly to see from God's perspective. Biblical foundation: Third Heaven (2 Cor 12:2-4, Paul caught up to paradise), Eagle's Wings (Isaiah 40:31, soaring on wings like eagles), Spirit Transportation (Ezekiel 3:12-14, Acts 8:39 Philip). Symbol meanings: Soaring/rising = heavenly perspective, intercessory altitude. Freedom in flight = liberation from earthly constraints. Difficulty flying = struggling in prayer, spiritual resistance. Height of flight = level of spiritual authority accessed. Flying often indicates intercessory prayer—eagle vision, seeing from God's perspective to pray His will."""
