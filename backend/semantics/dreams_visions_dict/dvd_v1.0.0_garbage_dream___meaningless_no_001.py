#### Source Text

"Garbage dreams are meaningless—result of daily stress, pizza before bed, brain processing trivia. Not every dream has deep meaning. Ignore these, don't waste time interpreting."

#### English Paraphrase

**Garbage Dream** = **meaningless mental noise**—no spiritual, psychological, or prophetic significance. Brain's "defrag" process, sorting daily clutter.

**Causes**:
- Physical: Late-night eating, digestive discomfort, medication side effects
- Mental: Stress, overwork, information overload
- Random: Neural firing, memory consolidation of trivial data

**Characteristics**:
- Incoherent, nonsensical, jumping randomly
- No emotional charge or spiritual weight
- Forgotten immediately upon waking
- Like mental static, not organized content

**Key Principle**: **Not every dream matters**. Filter out noise to focus on signal (significant dreams).

**How to Recognize**:
- No "knowing" or spiritual witness
- Feels empty, silly, disconnected
- Can't extract meaning even if you try
- Spirit is quiet, not highlighting it

**What to Do**: **Ignore**—don't force interpretation. Spiritual maturity = knowing what to discard.

**Caution**: Don't use "garbage dream" as excuse to avoid uncomfortable revelations. If dream bothers you or Holy Spirit highlights it, it's not garbage—it's Purging or Internal.

#### Chinese Explanation

**垃圾梦**=**无意义心智噪音**——无灵性、心理或先知意义。大脑"碎片整理"过程、整理日常杂乱。

**原因**：物理(深夜进食、消化不适、药物副作用)；心智(压力、过劳、信息过载)；随机(神经放电、琐碎数据记忆巩固)

**特征**：不连贯、无意义、随机跳跃；无情感电荷或灵性分量；醒来立即忘记；如心智静电非有组织内容

**关键原则**：**非每个梦都重要**。过滤噪音聚焦信号(重要梦)。

**如何识别**：无"知道"或灵性见证；感觉空、傻、断连；即使尝试也无法提取含义；灵安静、不强调它

**如何处理**：**忽略**——勿强迫诠释。灵性成熟=知道丢弃什么。

**警告**：勿用"垃圾梦"作借口回避不舒服启示。如梦困扰你或圣灵强调它、它非垃圾——是清理或内在梦。

#### Core Points

- **Meaningless Noise**: No spiritual, psychological, or prophetic significance.
- **Physical/Mental Causes**: Late-night eating, stress, information overload, random neural firing.
- **Characteristics**: Incoherent, forgettable, no emotional weight, Spirit quiet.
- **Response**: Ignore, don't force interpretation.
- **Maturity Test**: Spiritual maturity = knowing what to discard.

#### Detailed Explanation

Garbage Dreams are meaningless mental noise—no spiritual, psychological, or prophetic significance. They result from physical causes (late-night eating, medication), mental causes (stress, overwork), or random neural firing. Characteristics: incoherent, nonsensical, jumping randomly, no emotional charge, forgotten immediately. Key principle: not every dream matters. How to recognize: no "knowing" or spiritual witness, feels empty and disconnected, can't extract meaning even trying, Spirit is quiet. Response: ignore, don't force interpretation. Caution: don't use "garbage dream" as excuse to avoid uncomfortable revelations—if dream bothers you or Spirit highlights it, it's not garbage."""
