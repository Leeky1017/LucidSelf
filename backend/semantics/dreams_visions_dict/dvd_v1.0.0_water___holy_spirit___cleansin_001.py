#### Source Text

"Water symbolizes the Holy Spirit, cleansing, and the Word of God. Clean water = Spirit's presence and purity. Dirty water = contaminated teaching and worldliness. Flood = overwhelming spiritual move. Drowning = being overwhelmed by circumstances."

#### English Paraphrase

**Water** in Christian interpretation = **Holy Spirit, cleansing, Word of God** (not emotions/unconscious as in Jung).

**Biblical Foundation**:
- **Living Water**: John 4:10-14 (Jesus offers living water = eternal life)
- **Spirit**: John 7:38-39 (rivers of living water = Holy Spirit)
- **Word**: Ephesians 5:26 (washing by water through the Word)
- **Baptism**: Romans 6:4 (buried with Christ through baptism into water)

**Symbol Variations**:
- **Clean/Clear Water**: Holy Spirit's presence, purity, truth, life-giving refreshment
- **Dirty/Muddy Water**: Contaminated teaching, worldliness, impure doctrine, mixture
- **Flood**: Overwhelming move of Spirit, revival, or being overwhelmed by circumstances
- **Drowning**: Overwhelmed by life situations, need to come up for air (prayer/Word)
- **Ocean/Deep Water**: Depths of Spirit, prophetic realm, or overwhelming mystery
- **Rain**: Latter rain, outpouring of Spirit, blessing from heaven

**Comparison**:
- **Jung**: Water = emotions, unconscious, feminine principle, depths of psyche
- **Toach**: Water = Holy Spirit, Word, cleansing (spiritual not psychological)
- **Commonality**: Both see water as source/depth, but Jung = internal psyche, Toach = divine Spirit

#### Complete Chinese Interpretation

**水**在Christian诠释中=**圣灵、洁净、神的话**(非如Jung的情感/无意识)。

**圣经基础**：活水(约4:10-14,耶稣提供活水=永生)；灵(约7:38-39,活水江河=圣灵)；道(弗5:26,借道中水洗净)；洗礼(罗6:4,借水洗与基督同埋葬)

**符号变化**：清/净水(圣灵临在、纯洁、真理、生命更新)；脏/浑水(污染教导、世俗、不纯教义、混合)；洪水(压倒性灵运动、复兴、或被环境淹没)；溺水(被生活情况淹没、需浮上呼吸-祷告/道)；海洋/深水(灵深处、先知领域、或压倒性奥秘)；雨(后雨、灵浇灌、天降祝福)

**对比**：Jung(水=情感、无意识、女性原则、心灵深处)；Toach(水=圣灵、道、洁净-灵性非心理)；共性(都见水为源头/深度，但Jung=内在心灵，Toach=神圣灵)

#### Core Points

- **Holy Spirit/Word/Cleansing**: Water in Christian = Spirit, Word, cleansing (not emotions).
- **Biblical Foundation**: John 4 (living water), John 7 (Spirit rivers), Eph 5:26 (Word washing).
- **Symbol Variations**: Clean = purity; Dirty = contaminated teaching; Flood = spiritual move; Drowning = overwhelm.
- **vs Jung**: Jung sees water as emotions/unconscious; Toach sees water as divine Spirit.
- **Context Matters**: Clean vs dirty water indicates pure vs contaminated spiritual condition.

#### Detailed Explanation

Water in Christian dream interpretation symbolizes the Holy Spirit, cleansing, and the Word of God—not emotions/unconscious as in Jung. Biblical foundation: Living Water (John 4:10-14, Jesus offers eternal life), Spirit rivers (John 7:38-39, Holy Spirit), Word washing (Eph 5:26), Baptism (Romans 6:4). Symbol variations: Clean/clear water = Spirit's presence, purity, truth. Dirty/muddy water = contaminated teaching, worldliness, impure doctrine. Flood = overwhelming move of Spirit or being overwhelmed. Drowning = overwhelmed by circumstances, need prayer/Word. Ocean = depths of Spirit, prophetic realm. Rain = outpouring, blessing."""
