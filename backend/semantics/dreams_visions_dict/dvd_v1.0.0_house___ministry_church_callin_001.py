#### Source Text

"House symbolizes ministry, church, or calling—NOT self/psyche as in Jung. Different rooms = different ministry areas. Basement = hidden foundation issues. Upstairs = higher calling. Condition of house reflects ministry health, not psychological state."

#### English Paraphrase

**House** in Christian interpretation = **ministry, church building, calling** (contrasts sharply with Jung's "house = self/psyche").

**Christian vs Jungian Difference**:
- **Jung**: House = self, psyche structure (basement = unconscious, attic = superconscious, rooms = personality aspects)
- **Toach**: House = ministry, church, calling (rooms = ministry functions, condition = spiritual health of work)

**Biblical Foundation**:
- **House of God**: Temple, church, body of Christ (1 Cor 3:16, "you are God's temple")
- **Building/House**: Ministry metaphor (1 Cor 3:9-15, building on foundation)
- **Household**: Church family, believers (Eph 2:19, "members of God's household")

**Symbol Variations**:
- **Different Rooms**: Different ministry areas/functions (teaching room, worship space, administration office)
- **Basement**: Hidden foundation issues, unresolved problems affecting ministry, roots needing attention
- **Upstairs/Attic**: Higher calling, next level of ministry, ascension in purpose
- **Condition**: Ministry health (clean/organized = healthy, dirty/broken = problems needing addressed)
- **Size**: Scope of ministry (large house = wide influence, small = focused/intimate)

**Discernment**: Ask "Is this about my inner psyche (Jung) or my ministry/church life (Toach)?" Spirit witnesses which lens applies.

#### Complete Chinese Interpretation

**房屋**在Christian诠释中=**事工、教会、呼召**(与Jung"房屋=自我/心灵"尖锐对比)。

**Christian vs Jung区别**：Jung(房屋=自我、心灵结构-地下室=无意识、阁楼=超意识、房间=人格面向)；Toach(房屋=事工、教会、呼召-房间=事工功能、状况=工作灵性健康)

**圣经基础**：神殿(圣殿、教会、基督身体-林前3:16"你们是神殿")；建造/房屋(事工比喻-林前3:9-15在根基上建造)；家(教会家庭、信徒-弗2:19"神家里人")

**符号变化**：不同房间(不同事工领域/功能-教导室、敬拜空间、行政办公室)；地下室(隐藏根基问题、影响事工未解决问题、需注意根源)；楼上/阁楼(更高呼召、事工下层、目的上升)；状况(事工健康-干净/有序=健康、脏/破=需处理问题)；大小(事工范围-大房=广影响、小=聚焦/亲密)

**辨别**：问"这关于我内在心灵(Jung)还是我事工/教会生活(Toach)？"灵见证哪个镜头适用。

#### Core Points

- **Ministry/Church/Calling**: House = ministry, church, calling (NOT self/psyche as Jung).
- **Rooms = Ministry Areas**: Different rooms represent different ministry functions.
- **Basement = Foundation Issues**: Hidden problems affecting ministry, roots needing attention.
- **Upstairs = Higher Calling**: Next level, ascension in purpose.
- **Condition = Health**: Clean = healthy ministry; dirty/broken = problems needing addressed.

#### Detailed Explanation

House in Christian interpretation = ministry, church building, calling—sharply contrasting Jung's "house = self/psyche." Christian vs Jung: Jung sees house as psyche structure (basement = unconscious, rooms = personality), Toach sees house as ministry (rooms = functions, condition = spiritual health). Biblical foundation: House of God (temple, body of Christ, 1 Cor 3:16), building metaphor (1 Cor 3:9-15), household of believers (Eph 2:19). Symbol variations: different rooms = ministry areas; basement = hidden foundation issues; upstairs = higher calling; condition = ministry health; size = scope of influence.
